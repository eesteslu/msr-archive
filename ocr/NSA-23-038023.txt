PREFACE

The purpose of this symposium is to review and bring into
focus experience, progress and basic information on nuclear fuel
reprocessing methods. The principal emphasis is on nonaqueous
methods.

To lend perspective and orientation, one session is devoted to
the technology and economics of the more conventional and well-
established aqueous processing methods. This session is followed
by a series of papers describing pyrometallurgical or nonaqueous
methods. Much progress has been made in the development of
processes based on halide volatility and on oxidation-reduction re-
actions in metal-oxide and fused salt-liquid metal systems. This
is a very broad and potentially fertile area of research which ex-
tends beyond the area of fuel reprocessing. Fused salt-liquid me-
tal systems also are of interest in such areas as the development
of fuel cells, application of wear or corrosion resistance coatings
or cases on metals, methods for inorganic as well as organic
synthesis, etc.

The last two sessions are devoted to basic data and thermody-
namic properties. Phase relations and thermodynamic data are
particularly helpful in the design of new and better reprocessing
methods or in the improvement of existing methods. Often the
necessary data are not available and special emphasis has been
Placed on the evaluation or estimation of thermodynamic data from
Phase diagrams.

The papers on thermodynamics have been contributed by indi-
viduals from various disciplines and backgrounds. It is apparent
from these papers that there is a dire need for standardization of
the nomenclature employed for the thermodynamic description of
solutions. Time did not permit the adoption of a common nomen-
clature for the papers published in this volume. The interested
reader must bear the burden of deciphering the symbolism employ-
ed not only in this volume but in the published literature in general.
Hopefully the various disciplines will evéntually adopt a common
formalism.

Abstract

The low-priced power that is one of the incentives for the develop-
ment of the Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactor (IMFBR) depends in part
on economic processing of spent fuel. Some form of the Purex Aqueous
Solvent Extraction process is used by nearly every major fuel process-
ing facility in existence, and it will be desirable to extend its
application to include the processing of the IMFBR fuels, These
fuels are inherently more difficult to process than present light-
water reactor (IWR) fuels, owing to the fact that IMFER fuels will
operate at higher specific powers and for greater burnup and will
contain more plutonium than the corresponding IWR fuels, The
higher specific power and burnup produce heat dissipation problems
during handling and transport of the spent fuel, The high plutonium
content makes short cooling a significant economic incentive, and
development work will be aimed at improving our technigue for accom-
modating short-lived fission products to make short-cooled process-
ing feasible,

Introduction

This paper presents a description of the problems involved in the
application of aqueous chemical processing technology to the reproc-
essing of spent Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactor (IMFBR) fuels.

The present status of technology is also presented, based on the
development program in progress at Oak Ridge National Laboratory
and on technology available from private and AEC reprocessing instal-
lations, The objectives of the ORNL development program are: first,

to reduce, with time, the uncertainties that exist in applying present

aqueous processing technology to future IMFBR fuels; second, to pro-
vide the technology necessary to adapt IWR fuel processing plants to
the processing of IMFBR fuels in the interim period before the IMFBR
fuel load increases to the point that it can support a separate proc-
essing plant; and to provide the technology necessary for eventual
commercial IMFBR fuel reprocessing plants, The latter, long-term
approach is reserved for those problems that are occasioned by the
economic incentive for short-decay processing and which are of such
technical complexity as to require an extensive development period.

The first fuels to be reprocessed will be produced in the Fast
Flux Test Reactor (FFTF) and the demonstration reactors now being
proposed, The Atomic International Reference Oxide Reactor (NAA-
SR-Memo-126CL), has been selected as the reference reactor for the
initial reprocessing development program, since it is representative
of many of the new problems in reprocessing, which are not present
or are not as significant with light water reactors (IWR) fuels.
These problems are derived from four factors: (1) the desire to
minimize inventory costs and reprocess the fuel as soon after dis-
charges as possible, which causes higher thermal power, radiation
level, and concentrations of important volatile fission products;

(2) a high concentration of plutonium, which requires special consid-
eration for criticality control; (3) the presence of liquid sodium
on, or in, the fuel rods, and () the dimensions and method of fabri-
cation of the fuel assemblies, which present problems in preparing,
or disassembling, the fuel prior to reprocessing.

The present intention is to modify the current technology for
shipping and reprocessing IWNR fuels to the extent required for IMFER
fuels., The Purex solvent extraction process is used in all major
fuel reprocessing facilities in existence and its important favor-
able features also apply to the processing of IMFBR fuels., The
unexcelled separation efficiency, the process versatility, the ease
of adaptation of the process to continuous high-capacity equipment,
and the vast operating experience available from major processing
facilities make the aqueous solvent extraction process an obvious
choice for adaptation to reprocessing of IMFER fuel.
Purex Process

The Purex proces, as applied to IWR oxide fuels (see Fig, 1) con-
sists of fuel shearing to rupture the corrosion-resistant sheath and
expose the fuel, dissolution in nitric acid, solvent extraction, and
conversion of the uranium and plutonium nitrate product to oxides
for refabrication into fuel elements, The spent fuel is transported
from the reactor to the chemical processing plant in shielded casks,
which are unloaded in a water-filled pool or canal. The fuel elements
are transferred to a head-end cell, sheared into approximately 1/2 in.
lengths and the product leached with nitric acid in batch dissolvers,
The residual sheared, leached hulls are disposed of as solid waste.
The nitric acid solution of the fuel, containing uranium, plutonium,
and nearly all of the fission products, is the feed solution for the
solvent extraction process.

The solvent for the Purex process is an organic complexing com-
pound, tributyl phosphate (TBP), in an inert hydrocarbon kerosene-
like diluent such as dodecane, The solvent is brought into intimate
countercurrent contact with the aqueous feed solution where the TBP
extracts the uranium and plutonium into the organic phase, leaving
the fission and corrosion products in the aqueous solution, The
latter is stored as high-level radioactive waste. The organic solu-
tion is selectivity stripped of plutonium with dilute nitric acid by
reducing the plutonium valence from +4 to +3. The uranium is then
stripped in a third contactor, The plutonium is further purified
by additional extraction cycles or by ion exchange.

The uranium and plutonium may be precipitated from their dilute
nitric acid solution and converted to oxides by thermal decomposition,
or they may be directly converted to oxides by the sol-gel process,
in which the nitric acid is removed from aqueous solutions of pluto-
nium or uranium by extraction with an amine or heavy alcohol., In the
sol-gel process the uranium or plutonium, as the acid extraction
proceeds, gradually forms into a colloidal suspension or sol, This
can be handled like a true solution. Progressive removal of water
by evaporation or by extraction with a hygroscopic solvent converts
the sol to a plastic gel. Sols of plutonium and uranium can be
combined and gelled together to form an oxide in which the two ele-
ments are homogeneously dispersed, The gel when fired to ~ 1200°C
approaches theore%ica density and is suitable for fabrication into
reactor elements,‘\*’?®) The sol-gel process is designed to couple
easily with the Purex process for preparing plutonium for recycle,
However, uranium from IMFBR fuels has little value and will probably
be stored, Makeup uranium will be supplied from diffusion plant
tailings for many decades,

IMFBR Fuels

It is expected that oxide fuels sheathed in stainless steel will
be a characteristic of the early IMFBR reactors, and, for this reason,

oxide fuels have been adopted as the reference fuel for initial
processing studies, Advanced fuels, such as the carbides and nitrides,
have attractive properties and may be of future interest, From early
scouting experiments, it appears that carbides and nitrides are easi-
ly converted to oxides by heating in an oxidizing atmosphere.

The oxide core fuel element has three zones: the center section
is the core containing uranium oxide plus about 20% plutonium oxide
as the fissionable material, and the two end sections contain depleted
uranium oxide that form the axial blanket of the reactor (Fig. 2).
While it is practicable to separate the core from the two end blanket
sections and process them separately, there is no apparent advantage
in doing so, and it has been assumed that they will be processed
together. Elements of depleted uranium oxide that form the radial
blanket surround the core section of the reactor,

The average burnup of the fast breeder fuel is expected to be
approximately 80,000 Mwd/metric ton for the core, and about 33,000
Mwd/metric ton for the core and blanket mixture (see Table 1), This
average burnup is about that expected for IWR fuels, Fast-breeder
reactors will have a high fissionable plutonium inventory and the
specific power will be about 150 kw/kg of fuel in the core compared
to 35 for IWR's, This combination of high burnup and high specific
power makes the decay heat of discharged core fuel from fast-breeder
reactors about a factor of 5 higher than that of thermal reactors,
There will also be a higher concentration of long-lived fission pro-
ducts in the IMFBR core fuel, roughly in proportion to the higher
burnup., Fast-breeder fuels have a higher plutonium content than
light-water fuels by about a factor of 10, which complicates the
control of criticality, emphasizes the importance of plutonium chem-
istry, and may occasion the need for shielding for plutonium product
handling operations to attenuate the neutrons generated by c-n reactions
and spontaneous fissions, The value of the plutonium content of IMFBR
fuel results in an economic incentive for minimizing the decay period
before reprocessing.

Interim Processing

During the interim period, before facilities designed specifically
for short-cooled fast-breeder fuel are available, it should be possi-
ble to process the fuel from early fast-breeder reactors, the FFTF
and demonstration reactors, in existing IWR processing facilities
modified for this purpose. Such fuel could be cooled until shipment
is possible (not necessarily optimum for commercial fast-breeder fuel
but economically tolerable during the interim period)} and then proc-
essed at about half normal capacity in an existing IWR plant altered
to accommodate the greater length of the FFTF elements, deal with
sodium contamination, and provide capacity for the higher plutonium
content,

A preliminary evaluation was made of the capacity of the NFS plant
for the processing of IMFBR fuel. Assuming a mixed core and blanket
feed of 180 days decay, a throughput of 1/2 ton/day of LMFBR fuel
was found to be compatible with existing licensing agreements at NFS,
Modifications in the front end receiving and mechanical head-end
facilities, and in the plutonium tail-end ion-exchange equipment
would be required. A flowsheet based on 154 TBP and suberitical
feed concentrations would be dictated by the geometrically unrestric-
ted equipment at NFS. A plant operating time of L0 days should
accommodate the 20 tons of fuel discharged per year from a 1000-Mw(e)
IMFBR reactor, It was assumed that the capital modifications required
would cost $5 million, the annual charges of which would be borne by
the IMFBR fuel processed, in addition to the plant operating cost of
$31,300 per process day., On this basis the fuel reprocessing
cost would be on the order of 0.l mill/kwhr(e),\®

Process Adaptation

The long-range economic success of the LMFBR concept-is dependent
upon a relatively cheap fuel cycle and it is necessary to establish
chemical processing feasibility and acceptable processing costs if
the IMFBR concept is to be attractive to commercial interests. The
high plutonium content of IMFBR fuel represents a high dollar value,
and the inventory penalty while the fuel is not producing power can
become an appreciable fraction of the processing cost. At 12% per
annum, a month's storage is the economic equivalent of a 1% process
plutonium loss; and a 6 month preprocessing decay, required under
present technology for the decay of fission product iodine, would
constitute an inventory penalty approximately equal to the process-
ing cost, The optimum preprocessing decay period cannot now be
established, but the incentive for minimizing it is readily apparent.
The problems of heat dissipation, radiocactivity, and volatile fission
product retention are an exponential function of the decay period,

Shipping and Receiving:

ILWR fuel has been shipped in casks safely over a number of years
using only air as the primary coolant. Shipping IMFBR fuel in air-
filled casks is not feasible at ccoling time of less than one year,
For this reason we are proposing that a liquid metal be used as the
primary coolant. Sodium is an obvious choice, assuming that its loss
during accident conditions can be prevented, All shipments of spent
fuel are subject to the Depariment of Transportation (DOT)} regulations
which state that a cask must survive a 30 ft drop and a 1475°F fire
of 30 min duration without, excessive release of radioactive materials
or reduction in shielclj.ng.(4 Mechanically reliable closures are
commercially available that can probably be adapted to swrvive any
of the postulated impact conditions of a major accident. We have
made a conceptual design of a cask that uses steel for shielding.
Approximately 20 in., of steel will be required and the cask can be

10
so rugged that its rupture during any postulated impact, particularly
if fitted with an energy-absorbing exterior frame as shown in Fig, 3,
is virtually not conceivable., The illustrated model survived the 30
ft fall and impact on an unyielding surface, with only superficial
damage to the cask proper and no leakage of the seal.

The postulated fire test would not produce excessive temperatures
in the fuel cavity owing to the heat capacity of the massive steel
shield, This will require that the cask be at near-ambient tempera-
ture prior to the initiation of the fire, and a secondary coolant
system is envisioned (see Fig, L).

The conceptual design illustrated would accommodate 18 fuel ele-
ments, although a 36-element cask may be technically attainable.
The major parameters were varied as a function of the ratio of weight
of the cask to weight of fuel, Ws/Wr (see Table 2), The cask design
has not been optimized, but one restraint was the arbitrary acceptable
maximum fuel-pin cladding temperature of 1300°F, its maximum opera-
ting temperature in the reactor. Graded shielding refers to the
tapering of the ends of ,the carrier to the minimum required shielding
to economize on weight.\®’ Shortening the fuel by cropping the
inactive fuel element ends (gas plenum and end fittings) is attractive
from the shipping standpoint, in reducing the carrier size and weight,
but the investment in cropping equipment at the reactor station for
less than a 5000 Mw(e) sta}ion has been estimated to offset the
saving in shipping cost. (€

IMFBR fuels will be immersed in molten sodium during their
irradiation, and probably during transit to the processing facility.,
There may be sodium inside the fuel pins, either as the result of
failure of the tubes or by design (sodium bonding for heat transfer),
The presence, or the threat of the presence, of sodium in the fuel
pins will influence the method of handling and storage of IMFER fuel
at the reprocessing plant, The receiving facilities must be designed
to withdraw the subassemblies from their sodium-filled container(s)
into an inert atmosphere (see Fig(s). 5 and 6), Storage of the fuel
will be in sodium, or, if it is to be cleaned before shearing, in
inert gas with forced cooling. The possibility of failed, sodium-
logged pins makes storage in water unattractive,

Head-End:

The preparation of the fuel element for subsequent chemical steps
is complicated because of the need for efficient dissipation of
large amounts of heat while performing remote operations. A core
fuel element will exceed the maximum allowable temperature of 1300°F
in about 20 minutes if not cooled,

The most attractive and versatile head-end step at present is the
mechanical shearing of the fuel into short lengths, Melting of the

cladding or dissolution of the cladding in molten metals such as zinc
or antimony-copper alloy are interesting alternatives for some possi-
ble cladding materials, but both require the physical separation and
recovery of the fuel oxides, a difficult step,

If it is practical to disassemble the fuel element into individual
rods or small clusters, the heat dissipation problem is ameliorated
and the mechanical shear can be small, relatively inexpensive, and
easily maintained (see Fig, 7). Disassembly involves trimming the
end fittings with an abrasive saw and slitting the shroud with a
milling slitter, The wire-wrapped pins can then be handled in arrays
of about 25 without exceeding the maximum temperature of 1300°F, If
spring clip spacers are used in place of wire wrapping, an additional
removal step to free the rods will be required,

The problem of the retention of *3'I, encountered even in the
processing of IWR fuels of 150 days gdecay, is an important problem
with IMFBR fuels., ITodine retention factors are required that are in
the range of 10%® for 150-day-cooled FFTF fuel (near the range of
present practice) to 10° for future IMFBR fuel processed after 30
days decay. The chemistry of iodine is complex and much more knowl-
edge is needed of the behavior of iodine in the various conditions
encountered in a fuel processing plant before a treatment system
can be designed with the reliability required for IMFBR fuels, As
an example, the presence of organic vapors and organic iodides in
the off-gas system reduces the efficiency of iodine removal steps.
Early studies indicate that the organic materials can be eliminated
from the off-gas by conversion to CO,, H,0, and I, in a catalytic
oxidizer using Hopcalite catalyst (oxides of copper and manganese)
at 150 to 500°C, A catalytic-oxidizer-charcoal-adsorber system was
tested in the Transuranium Processing Plant (TRU) at Oak Ridge
National Laboratory and an iodine retention factor of about 10° was
demonstrated,

It has been found that fission gases interstitially trapped
in oxide fuels can be volatilized and collected in a relatively
small volume when oxide fuels are heated in oxygen at temperatures
greater than ~ 400°C., Similar volatilization is expected on oxida-
tion of carbide or nitride fuels, Early studies show that nearly
quantitative removal of noble gases and >90% removal of iodine and
tritium is obtained on conversion of U0; to Uz0g;. The release of
gases is more difficult when the fuel contains a high percentage of
Pu0, (~ 20%)., However, >90% of the tritium and 20-98% of the
krypton have been removed from highly irradiated 20% PuQ,-U0,. The
removal of iodine from PuO,-UO, remains to be demonstrated.

The efficiency of iodine removal from off-gases should be much
higher if it is contained in a small volume of gas after the fuel
is sheared but before it reaches the dissolver, This should greatly
reduce the problems attributed to removing iodine from dissolver
off-gases in current processing experience, The oxidative heat

treatment may have other advantages as well, Sodium contamination
(failed fuel rods) would be deactivated, and the oxidation of U0,
to Uz;05 involves a phase change which tends to break the oxide into
a fine granular form, making the physical separation of the oxides
from the stainless steel cladding a possibility and providing for a
faster dissolution of the fuel in nitric acid, This improvement is
probable but whether it applies also to the mixed oxide is yet to
be determined, The oxidation of uranium oxide before dissolution
also decreases the evolution of nitrous oxides in the dissolver off-
gas., The oxidation step may also be & useful mea?s og converting
the carbide and nitride advanced fuels to oxides, (7?8

Dissolution:

The dissolution of solid solutions of (Pu,U)0, proceeds quite
readily in nitric acid and the use of fluoride as a catalyst does
not appear to be required, IMFBR fuel samples irradiated to 100,000
Mwd/metric ton have been successf?ll{ ?issolved in hot-cell tests at
ORNL in 8 M HNOz in 4 to 8 hours,\®’*°/ Residues contained <0,2%
plutonium and consist mainly of ruthenium and rhodium and insoluble
stainless steel.

Irradiated fuels prepared by the sol-gel, co-precipitation, and
mechanical blending processes have been successfully dissolved,
However, if a true solid solution has not been formed, the PuO, may
dissolve too slowly in nitric acid, The sol-gel and co-precipitation
processes inherently produce intimate mixtures of PuO, and U0,.

Care must be exercised to assure homogeneous blending of cxides if
a solid solution is to be produced.

Elemental iodine is evolved rapidly from the hot nitric acid
dissolving solution, TIodine present as the iodide oxidizes rapidly
to elemental iodine, and that present as the iodate is reduced to
elemental iodine by the nitrous acid formed during dissoclution of
U0,. In small-scale tests at ORNL, > 99% of the iodine has been
removed during dissolution by a proper arrangement of the condenser
system (to avoid refluxing iodine back to the dissolver) and by
adding iodide and nitrite to the system at the end of the dissolving
period., It is desirable to remove iodine before extraction because
of the difficulty of containing iodine in the subsequent processing
steps,

Extractions:

Solvent extraction processes require organic extraction media,
and organics are susceptible to radiation damage. However, radiation
damage to the solvent, in spite of the high specific activity of the
IMFBR fuels, should not be a significant problem,

The estimated total single-cycle dose to the solvent in pulsed
column operation is about 0,11 watt-hr/liter for the 15% TBP flowsheet

19
and about 0.25 watt-hr/liter for the 30% TBP flowsheet, These

doses include an allowance of 20% of the P-y dose obtained in the
extraction-scrub section to cover alpha irradiation and irradiation
from ®*I (which may have accumulated in the solvent). The estimates
are for columns operating in the organic-phase-continuous mode at

80% og flooding with an efficiency corresponding to an HETS of 2.5
£t.(°) "The British have demonstrated sustained solvent extraction
where the single-cycle dose was about 1.l watt-hr/liter.(:l) By
using high-speed conta%§gss, such as the centrifugal contactors in
use at Savannah River the extent of solvent exposure to radia-
tion can be held far below the limits that have already proved
satisfactory in plant practice,{(®). These contactors also have

high capacity and quick response and are applicable over a wide

range of scale. On the bases of laboratory and hot-cell tests, we
have concluded further that pulse columns, such as are currently used
in many fuel processing plants, are adequate for IMFBR fuel processing.

Separation of plutonium from uranium is accomplished in the Purex
process by reducing the plutonium to the three-valent state to '
selectively strip it from the solvent. Ferrous sulfamate is used as
the reductant in U, S. processing plants, However, IMFBR reactor
fuels have a much higher plutonium content and, consequently, the
use of ferrous sulfamate could contribute relatively large amounts
of iron and sulfate to the waste. The sulfate also would interfere
severely with plutonium extraction in the second TBP cycle.

The use of ferrous nitrate, stabilized with a small concentration
of a holding reductant such as hydrazine, has shown promise in small-
scale cold tests,‘\'*) Tts use has the advantage of eliminating sulfate,
although it still contributes iron to the waste (about as much iron
as there is total weight of fission products). By appropriate con-
trol of the acid concentration, the partitioning can be accomplished
using as little as 25% of the stoichiometric amount of iron otherwise
needed, reducing the iron contributed to the waste to about 20% of
the weight of the fission products,

Uranium{IV) has been studied extensively as a reductant by many
investigators and is used on a production basis in France, It has
the advantage of not adding metal contaminants to the waste, The
U(IV) nitrate can be prepared by electrolytic reduction, by reduction
with H, in the presence of platinum catalyst, or by photoactivated
reduction with formaldehyde. The reaction rate for reduction with
U(IV) is slower than for Fe(II), which may be of importance if
short-residence contactors are used.

Final purification of plutonium by extraction using secondary
amines is an attractive alternative to anion exchange, the process
used in present processing plants, A continuous countercurrent
extraction process has obvious advantages over the batch ion exchange
process, particularly where criticality considerations may be limit-
ing and where the equipment must be remotely operated and maintained.

20
Shielding will probably be required, because of the a-n reactions

and spontaneous fissions from the plutonium. In addition, extraction
processes will couple readily to the preparation of reactor-grade
oxides by the sol-gel process.

Summarz

The economic advantage of large-scale processing plants is So
prominent that central processing facilities of capacities in the
order of 5 tons/day or greater throughput are generally to be pre-
ferred to a proliferation of small (< 1 ton/day) facilities. The
continued expansion of the power economy and the increasing technol-
ogy of power transmission makes large central power parks, in the
order of 20,000 Mw, a plausible concept. An on-site processing
facility to serwe this power park (~ 1 ton/day) begins to acquire
favorable economics due to savings in fuel shipping end inventory
costs, The essential processing problems are similar except for fuel
transport.

It is expected that plant design trend will be in the direction
of high-capacity, small-volume equipment; this is equivalent to
minimizing the plant inventory of both reactor fuel and process rea-
gents, Continuous equipment (as opposed to the batch operations
characterizing the industry in the past), and perhaps parallel lines
to ensure operational continuity, will be easier to maintain and
cheaper to operate, Minimizing the in-process inventory will serve
both safety and economy considerations.

Fuel casks are expensive but are most economical in large sizes
(about 120 tons), Casks will be designed to ensure containment of
the enclosed fuel throughout the postulated accidents that might
occur during shipment, The cask seals will be designed to permit
the carrier to be readily loaded and unloaded at the processing
plant to minimize carrier turnaround time,

Present mechanical shears are designed to accept entire subassem-
blies, denuded only of their hardware. Were the fuel elements design-
ed to be readily disassembled, preshipment disassembly might prove
economical by decreasing the cask size and facilitating heat dissipa-
tion during shipment. Smell, inexpensive, easily maintained, high-
capacity shears will be especially attractive if the fuel is easily
disassembled,

The most noxious problem facing processing plants of the future
is that of the volatile fission products, especially I, The
volatile fission products, icdine, the noble gases, xenon and kryp-
ton, and tritium, perhaps can be volatilized from oxide fuel at
moderate temperatures (L50 to 750°C). If dilution by the cell
atmosphere is minimized, the fission product gases can be very con-
centrated, meking their capture and reduction to solid form efficient

21
and reliable,

The advantages of continuous leachers have always been recognized,
but the simpler batch dissolvers were not only adequate but even
preferred for small plants, particularly where process control relied
upon chemical analysis, Continuous leachers are presently under
active development, in response to the obvious advantages of their
small physical volume from the standpoint of criticality control,

Countercurrent solvent extraction has been carried out in a
variety of contactors: mixer-settlers and pulse columns and more
recently in fast centrifugal contactors. The latter reduces radiation
and chemical damage to the solvent, and reduces the solvent inventory
(and therefore the fire hazards associated with the organics are also
reduced)., Centrifugal contactors are so responsive that automatic
control can be used to simplify operation.

The cell ventilation and vessel off-gas systems are primary
sources of routine and accidental radiocactivity release, Recycle
of cell off-gas is feasible and will minimize the volume of off-gas
needing routine treatment. Recycle will probably be quite economi-
cal and the uge of an inert cell atmosphere (necessary for the sodium-
contaminated IMFBR fuel) will become practical, The use of inert
cell atmosphere throughout the plant will practically eliminate the
hazard of solvent fires,

In many cases the aqueous high-level radioactive wastes will con-
tinue to be stored for interim periods in tanks, However, the trend
is toward solidification and immobilization of these wastes as soon
as possible, as dictated by safety and economics, The technology of
solid ficat}on of wastes is now in the final stages of develop-
ment, 1618

Abstract

The KFA-TBP 23/25-procese 1s being developed for the
aqueous reprocessing of thorium-containing fuel elements.
In the proposed head-end, a rapid and complete dissolu-
tion of highly sintered (Th,U)O,-particles is achieved
by digestion in molten potassium pyrosulphate. Fertlle
materlal 1s lsolated as potassium sulphatothorate 1n a
Eggcentration step and may be stored until most of the

Th has decayed. 233Pa, the 27,4-day precursor of 233U,
will be recovered by adsorption on powdered unfired vy-
Egg. Uranium, consisting mainly of the isotopes 235U and

U, 1s decontaminated by a TBP solvent-extraction pro-
g8edure. A sultable flowsheet for an economical reproces-
ping of the sulphate-contalning feed solutlion was deve-
loped and tested in cold runs.

Introduction

Computer calculations on the long-term potential of
high-temperature gas-cooled reactors in the future com~
pound network of the Federal Republic of Germany indi-
cate that this reactfor type will secure a consglderable
share of the generating capacity far beyond the year
2,000. The estimates for the year 1985 come up with a pa-
wer output share of about 30, 000 MWg, nhia? should fur-
ther increaseto about 250,000 MWe in 2010 (1),

The first reactor ceneratlon ls expected to be opera-
ble 1n the middle of the seventies. In order to guaran-
tee a complete fuel eyele to the future reactor users,
appropriate procedures for the reprocessing of spent
fuel elements must be evolved in time.

In the Federal Republic of Germany the development of
the technology for reprocessing spent HTGR-fuels began
in 1966. The results and experience gained to date 1nde-
cate that in the first reprocessing period only a wet
chemical process such as solvent-extraction can satis-
factorily separate the feed and/or bred material from
the fisslon products. This concluslen is not murprising
since 1n 25 years' of experlence in reprocessing, only
extraction processes have been practical on an industrial
scale.

KFA-TBP 23/25-Process

Process~-Philosophy

In planning the KFA-TBP 23/25-process we have been
gulded by the following conslderations:

1. Fuel elements for high-teémperature gas-cooled reac-
tors consist of pyrolytic carbon coated uranium and/
or thorium carbide or oxide partlcles dlspersed 1n a
graphite matrix. On a technical scale the removal of
all of the carbon, that means the structural graphite
as well as the coating, appears feasible only by burs+
ning.

2, Mixed oxides should be preferable as the fuel partic-
les because of cheaper production and better beha-
viour under reactor conditions than the carbides.
Their strong chemical resgistance against the only
known dissolving agent, F -catalysed nltric acld,
may require the application of a technologically ad-
vanced solubilizing procedure.

26
3. The main part of the process. the solvent-extraction,
shall be a TBP-procedure, Only when using the "clas-
slc" extractlion medium whose technology has already
been thoroughly investigated, will the setting up of
a total process line be possible in the near future.

i, For the present, an isolation of decontaminated tho-
rilum can be renounced. The small share of the cost of
the thorium on the complete fuel cycle costs makes 1t
adgisible to store the used thorium until most of the
220Th has decayed.

5. The process should be capable of treating fuel ele-
ments after short cooling periods. Therefore, a pro-
cess step for the recovery and puriflication of the
relatively long-lived 233U-precursor, 233Pa, has to
be provlided. This point 1s partlcularily important
with regard to the reprocessing of fuel elements from
the pebble~bed reactor. The continuous loading and
unloading of feed and bred elements has the highest
economical efficiency only if the fuels can be re-
processed immediately after belng discharged from the
reactor.,

OQutline of the Process

Based on the above considerations the flowsheet shown
in figure 1 was developed.

In the first step the crushed fuel elements are
burned 1n a fluldized-solids furnace at temperatures be-
tween 700 and 850 ©oC.

The remaining thorium-uranium mixed oxide particles
are then digested in a potassium pyrosulphate melt. Af-
ter the reaction has been finished, the liquid melt will
pneumatically be pushed out of the crucible and poured
into the requlsite amount of water necessary for disso-
lution.

Insoluble fission product sulphates, principally ba-
rium- and strontium sulphate, are separated by a cyclone
separator or by fllters and the clear solutlion is then
passed over a vycorglass-column to remove the protacti-
nium stlll present in equilibrium.

The resulting protactinium-free fuel solution of a
now reduced specific activity level will be concentra-
ted and adjJusted to TBP-extraction conditions by adding
nitric acid and aluminium nitrate. The uranium concen-
tration of the feed solution amounts to 20 g/l; it 1s

Burning

No thorough description of the burning step will be
given here since most of the de%a%ls are already known
and partly published elsewhere (3), An essential diffe-
rence of our approach compared to the other known me-
thods 1s the fact that we are not using any alumina as
a diluent and thermal transmltter in the fluidized bed.
To avoid thermal hot spots close above the bottom flow
plate, the burning gas 1is diluted by refluxing carbon
dioxide. This method avolds the difficulties encountered
in the dissolution of the ashes in the presence of alu-
mina.

Salt-Melt-Digestion

The knowledge of the most effective reaction tempera-
ture was of declslve importance for a rational carrying
out of the pyrosulphate salt-melt dissolution. The tem-
perature determines not only the kinetics of the reac-
tions

and thereby the minimum quantity of melt necessary per
welght unit of mixed thorium-uranium oxide. Thorough in-
vestigations showed that the most favourable temperature
range lles between 700 and 750 9C. Under these conditions
the pyrolysis of K 320 1s kept within tolerable limits
and the reactions E) tZ 3) proceed fast enough to guaran-
tee a complete dissolutiorn of 100 grams of fuel partic-
&es in the 4.5-fold guantity of melting material within
hours.

Protactinium-Recovery

The method of the sorptive protactinium pre-isolation
originates from investigations of American sclentists
some years ago. They succeeded in removing 97 % of the
protactinium present 1in ﬁitrate solutions by sorptlion on
powdered unfired Vycor (4). our own experiments have
shown that this procedure can also be applied in the sul-
phate system since the process solu%io? Setained only

3 - 4 9 of nonadsorbable protactinium (3). It should be
pointed out that these data were obtalned with tracer
amounts of protactinlum, however, we are qulte optimi-
stlc regarding a separation of macro-quantities, since
Z00DE and MOORE have already confirmed the{g tracer re-
sults with mmol quantitles of protactinium ).

Thorium-Iscolatlion and Feed~Adjustment

With respect to the technical aspects of the process,
the pyrosulphate salt-melt dissolutlion exhibits a cer-
tain disadvantage 1n that very dilute solutions are ob-
talned. The reason for this 1is the poor solubility of
thorium sulphate, which under the conditions in question
permits only thorium concentrations of about 5 g/l. Natu-
rally, the content of fissile materiasl 1s comparably low
too, and amounts to approx. 1 g/l with fuel particles
having a thorium : uranium ratio of 5 : 1. Since the re-
processing of such dllute sclutlons may hardly be done
in an economical way, we declded to introduce a concen-
trating step in ader to end up with solutions of 20 g/1
after the feed adjustment. The uranium losses observed
in connection with the quantitative thorium precipitation
are rather small; the sulphatothorate isolated in experi-
ments carried out so far contalned always less than
0.1 % of the total uranium.

Filrst Uranlum Extraction.Cycle

The chemical flowsheet developed for the first extrac-
tion cycle is shown in figure 2.

Extractlon~-Serub Unit

The following operation conditions were chosen: feed
solution with an uranium content of 20 g/1, 1 mol alumi-
nium nitrate, 2.5 mol/1 of free acid and a sulphate con-
centration of ¥ 0.5 mol/l. The exact sulphate concentra-
tion depends on the uranium to thorium ratic of the dis-
solved (Th,U)OQ-particles, 1t never exceeds however
0.5 mol/1.

The aluminium nitrate concentration employed 1s a com-
promise between economical aspects (minimum of solid
waste, low costs of chemicals) and practical require-
ments (low stage values and an uranium concentration in
the ogganic phase as hlgh as possible in the feed input
stage).

The acld concentration of 2.5 mol/1l, which together
with the acid from the scrub section results in a total
acld concentration of 3 mol/l in the extraction sectiin
was chosen to ensure a good ruthenlum decontamlnation 75.
This fission product requires speclal attention in the
first extraction cycle. A partlal pre-decontaminatlion
of some other unpleasant flssion products like zirconium,
niobium and cerium has already taken place durilng the
concentrating step.

The number of theoretical stages necessary for a bet-
ter than 99.99 % recovery of uranium may be deduced from
figure 3.

As one can see, the necessary theoretical stages at a
sulphate concentration of 0.5 mol/l1 amounts to 6. In
practice about 8 stages are needed because of a 75 %
efficlency of the individual stages. When the sulphate
concentration is lower than 0.5 mol/l, the number of
stages decreases, because the uranium distribution coef-
flcients are increasing.

For scrubbing of extracted fisslon product activities,
5 molar nitric acid is used. Again the high acild concen-
tration serves for a good ruthenilum decontamination but
it causes also a diminution of the zirconium-niobium and
cerium content of the organic phase. As can be seen from
figures 3 and 4 the operating line of the scrubbing sec-
tion intersects the inherent uranium equillbrium line,

Abstract

The paper presents the approach to the establishment of
reprocessing facilities in India in the context of the technological
development and economic factors in a developing country. The
impact of less expensive labour and construction costs and less
developed transportation facilities on the size and distribution of
reprocessing facilities is discussed briefly. The capital and
operating costs for the Trombay demonstration plant and the es-
timated costs for a 500 Kg per day plant under construction for
BWR and CANDU type fuels are included. The plans for repro-
cessing fast reactor fuels are also discussed.

Introduction

The fuel reprocessing programme in India is developing in
stages. The first demonstration plant (1) was set up in Trombay
to reprocess the metallic uranium fuel irradiated in the CIRUS, a
40 MW heavy water moderated research reactor. This plant has
been in operation since 1965(2). With the setting up of the power
stations at Tarapur and Ranapratapsagar, a plant is under con-
struction for the reprocessing of the BWR type fuel from the
Tarapur power station and the Candu type fuel from the Ranapra-
tapsagar power station. The third power station is under con-
struction at Kalpakkam near Madras based on a Candu design. The
Indian nuclear power programme also includes the setting up of a
fast test breeder reactor at Kalpakkam. A reprocessing complex
for the irradiated fuel from the Candu type power station as well
as the fast test breeder reactor is planned for construction at
Kalpakkam. The present paper attempts to outline the background
to the decisions regarding the setting up of the fuel reprocessing
plants in various locations in the country, the economics of the
construction and operation of such facilities and the research and
development programme pertaining to fuel reprocessing of thermal
as well as fast reactor fuels.

The fuel reprocessing plant at Trombay operates on the conven-
tional Purex process with a codecontamination cycle, a partition
cycle, a third uranium purification cycle and an ion exchange cycle
for the final purification and concentration of plutonium. The plant
has seven solvent extraction columns of the pulsed perforated plate
type, two ion exchange columns for the plutonium cycle and 100
vessels including 10 evaporators for the concentration of intercycle
products and high and medium active wastes. The process equip-
ment involved fabrication of 100 tonnes of stainless steel. The
piping inside the cells is about 100, 000 ft. The cells have heavy
density concrete walls (220 Ib per cft) with thickness ranging from
5 ft at the dissolver end to 3 ft at the product end. The plant was
constructed during 1961-64 at which time the cost of heavy con-
crete complete with steel was Rs.17 per cft ($ 96* per cu. yard).
The cost of fabrication of stainless steel equipment was Rs. 7, 500/-
per tonne ($ 1550% per tonne). The over all capital costs of the
Plant were as follows:

Rs. Million ($ Million)*

Cost of equipment, piping and
services (including erection) 19.0 (4. 0)

Civil Engineering Works (including
plumbing, drainage and site
preparation etc.) 12.0 (2.5)

The plant cost can also be broken up broadly as follows:

Waste Treatment & Storage

Facilities 9.7 (2.0)

37.2 (7.7)

The operation of the plant requires 200 persons. About
1/3 of the plant is now being utilised for non-operational purposes,
viz., for development work. The fixed charges are calculated at
12-1/2% on Rs. 26 million.

Labour & Supervision Rs. 1.50 million
Overheads Rs. 0.45 "
Equipment & Stores Rs. 1.00 "
Power, water & other services Rs., 0.40 "
Fixed charges Rs. 3.25 "

Rs. 6.60 million

For the nominal capacity of 30 tonnes uranium per year the
cost of reprocessing works out as Rs. 220/~ ($ 29) per kg uranium.
For fuel irradiated to 1000 MWd tonne, the cost of processing with

41
respect to plutonium is Rs. 275 ($ 37) per gm upto its conversion to
plutonium oxide. The operation of the plant has shown that a more
economical plant with 6 solvent extraction columns (1A, 1S, 1BX,
1C, 2D & 2E), 2 ion exchange columns, 50 process vessels and

50, 000 ft of piping with half the cell volume of the Trombay Plant
can be constructed for efficient operation with an O & M strength

of 150 persons. Capital cost of such a plant at today's wages and
prices would be about Rs. 34 million ($ 4.6 million - 1968). If

such a plant is built now it would not use heavy concerete for cells
nor would the thickness of the cell-walls be as high as has been used
for the Trombay Plant. The cost of conventional concrete assumed
is Rs. 12 per cft ($ 43 per cubic yard) for cell walls. At today's
prices the cost of fabrication of stainless steel equipment would be
Rs.12, 000 per tonne ($ 1600 per tonne). The cost of reprocessing

in such a plant would work out as Rs. 200/kg ($ 27 per kg) of uranium
and corresponding cost of Rs. 250/gm with respect to plutonium. ’

The experience in the operation of the plant has provided not
only the knowhow for the design of future bigger plants but has in-
dicated the fruitful areas of research and development for efficient
utilisation of the resources allocated for the purpose.

Power Reactor Fuel Reprocessing

The first power station which is expected to go in full operation
by the middle of 1969 is at Tarapur, 60 miles north of Bombay. This
has two boiling water reactors of nett output 380 MWe usiag uranium
oxide of initial enrichment varying from 1.8 % to 2.5 % U 5. The
second power station of the Candu type is under construction at
Ranapratapsagar near the city of Kota in Rajasthan. The first unit
of 200 MWe will deliver power in 1970/71 and the second unit two
years thereafter. The third power station which will also be of
Candu type is under construction at Kalpakkam, 50 miles south of
Madras. The first unit will deliver 200 MWe in 1973. The capacity
of the second unit on this location is likely to be 200/300 MWe and
the time schedule for this unit calls for completion in -1974/75. The
power programme of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission visualises
the addition of 200 to 500 MWe nuclear power every year in the form
of Candu type of reactors.

The approach to the reprocessing of irradiated fuel from power
reactors is conditioned by non-availability of highly enriched uranium
and the consequent urgent need for plutonium for the fast reactor
programme to utilise the vast thorium reserves in the country, the
variation in capital investment and operating costs of reprocessing
plants compared with more advanced countries and the problems
involved in transporting large quantities of radiocactive material
over long distances in the country in the background of the develop-
ment of rail and road transport. The location of power stations is
based on the demand for power and the economics of nuclear power
generation vis-a-vis conventional power stations. The scope for

42
the sizing and siting of reprocessing plants extends from small
plants attached to each power station to a large scale central plant
catering to many power stations. It is not always found feasible to
have package plants in every reactor location on account of the
limitations associated with the capacity of the environments to ac-
cept discharge of liquid and gaseous wastes from reprocessing plants
in addition to those generated from the nuclear power stations. While
India has a fairly extensive railway net work the existence of two
different gauges of railways and the already heavy goods and passenger
traffic on the existing railway lines impose limitations for rail trans-
port of irradiated fuels in some sectors. Roadways are not uniformly
developed all over the country and in each instance a decision has to
be taken about the feasible mode of transport. These factors coupled
with the longterm nature of the decisions regarding the locations of
future power stations preclude the possibility of a large size central
reprocessing plant. The compromise of setting up regional repro-
cessing plants near suitable nuclear power stations appears to be

the solution, transporting irradiated fuel from nearby nuclear power
stations wherever transportation by road or rail of irradiated fuel

is safe and feasible. The first reprocessing plant for power reactor
fuels, under construction at Tarapur, is based on this principle and
will reprocess fuels from the boiling water reactor station which is
only a kilometer away and from the Candu power station in Rajasthan
500 miles away from where a combination of transportation by road
and rail is felt to be feasible.

In the context of the economics of setting up of reprocessing
plants in India the influence of size is not considerable above 1
tonne per day capacity, according to present day prices and skilled
labour costs. Fig. 1 gives the estimated cost for construction of
reprocessing plants in India for treating Candu type fuel elements
irradiated to 8000 - 10000 MW days per tonne, the plant operating
for 250 days. Approximately the cap'htal investment for plant follows
the relation Rs. 75 x 10° (MT/day)"" =.

In this connection a comparison of capital costs and reprocessing
costs estimated in India with those estimated for more advanced
countries say U.S.A., is revealing. The basic differences in the
capital as well as the operating costs arises out of the wide differ-
ences in the skilled labour cost which is lower in India by a factor
10 to 15 and the appreciable difference in construction costs. For
instance, the cost of a cubic yard of concrete is reported to be
$ 100 in the USA(3), against Rs. 12 per cft ($ 43 per cubic yard)
in India. Similarly the cost of construction of a plant building com-
plete with normal services in U.S.A. is estimated as $ 2.5 to 3 per
cft(3) as against Rs. 7 per cft in India ($ 0.95 per cft). Engineering
and commissioning costs for such plants form about 12 % of the total
cost of construction in India whereas the figure mentioned for U.S.A.
is above 20 %. Applying suitable weightage factors for reduced com-
pliment of labour due to mechanised construction in the advanced
countries one can estimate that a plant for 1 tonne a day that can be

43
set up in India for Rs. 75 million ($ 10 million) would cost $ 27
million in North America with no change in design. In the developed
countries perforce it becomes necessary to incorporate instrumenta-
tion and automation to reduce the labour costs for operation. Thus

a plant of 1 tonne a day may cost $ 28 to 30 million in North America.
This estimate is close to the reported cost of the N¥S pla.nt( . Fig.
1 gives the compa.riso& of costs for different capacities, based on
published information ) and estimates for plants in India.

A similar effect is seen in the operating costs as well. Fif-
teen per cent charges on investment are reported for Canadian con-
ditions(5) as against 12.5 % adopted for computation of Indian pro-
cessing cost. Reprocessing cost in a 1 tonne a day plant operating
for 250 days a year in India is estimated at Rs. 66 ($ 8. 8) per kg
uranium as against Rs. 210 ($ 28) per kg in North America based
on labour costs ratios with suitable weightage for decreased number
of O & M staff and assuming all other charges like chemicals,
consumables, spares, maintenance materials, power, water, etc.,
to be the same in both countries. ﬁ‘ig. 2 gives the estimated op-
erating costs in India and Canada'”/ and compares the operating costs
with respect to the major components. It is seen that cost of re-
processing one kg uranium in India follows approximately the re-
lation Rs. 66 (MT/day)}* 'x' being nearer minus 0.6 below 1 MT/day
and nearer minus 0. 45 above 1 MT/day. Incidence of fuel reprocess-
ing costs on power costs in India decreases rapidly from 0. 45 p/Kwh
to 0.17 p/Kwh when the capacity is increased from 100 kg to 500 kg
per day. Thereafter the decrease is marginal; 0.12 p/Kwh for a 1
tonne a day plant and 0.06 p/Kwh for a 5 tonne a day plant (Fig. 3).

From the above it will be clear that the considerations that
govern the decisions regarding the capacity of reprocessing plants
are quite different at least for the time being between India and the
more advanced countries like U.S.A. and Canada. The unit repro-
cessing cost obtained in India with a 500 Kg a day plant is obtainable
only with a plant of 3 to 4 tonnes a day in developed countries. It
is expected that for the next decade with the pressing demand on
finance for capital investment it will not be economical nor techni-
cally advantageous to set up reprocessing plants larger than 0.5 to
1 tonne a day in India.

The Indian Nuclear Power Programme is based on the pro-
duction of plutonium in natural uranium reactors and utilising the
plutonium for conversion of thorium into uranium-233 ultimately
leading to the uranium-233 - thorium cycle. This is necessitated
by the limited resources of uranium and vast reserves of thorium.
The two reactor systems of interest for the utilisation of plutonium
are the Fast Breeder and the Molten Salt Breeder reactors. The
need for separating enough plutonium for going over to these systems
influences the decisions regarding the setting up of fuel reprocess-
ing facilities. Normally, one would optimise the timing and the
sizing of the reprocessing plants to ensure maximum load factor.

47
The initial slow pace of development of nuclear power, the setting
up of our first few nuclear power stations in locations far apart
over a vast country like India and the necessity for setting up
regional processing plants do not, as discussed earlier, permit to
avail of full load factor. The object essentially is to ensure that all
plutonium produced in nuclear power stations is recovered as
quickly as possible. The regional reprocessing plants are sized

in a fashion that they can absorb the load from nuclear power
stations in the region as and when they are set up. For instance
the Tarapur Reprocessing Plant has been designed for a capacity

of half a tonne uranium per day though the minimum load available
is from the Tarapur Boiling water power station (25 tonnes a year)
and the two units of the Ranapratapsagar power station (50 tonnes

a year). This plant can very likely absorb additional load from
another Candu type 400 MWe station in a location from where trans-
portation of fuel should be feasible. By the present analysis, .
transportation to this plant should be feasible from a power station
accessible by road from a railhead in Central or Northern India.
Similarly transportation of irradiated fuel should be possible from
many of the southern parts of the country to the Fuel Reprocessing
Plant proposed to be set up at Kalpakkam near Madras. Between
these two reprocessing plants fuel from nuclear power stations of
the Candu type upto a total of 2,000 MWe installed capacity can be
processed.

The Tarapur Fuel Reprocessing Plant

The design of this plant is based on the Purex Process. A
codecontamination cycle followed by partition cycle and two separate
purification cycles for the uranium and plutonium are visualised.
Purification cycle for plutonium will be chosen from among a TBP
process and TLA process. The boiling water reactor fuel element
is about 14 ft long and contains massive pieces of zircaloy and al-
so0 various minor materials of construction other than zircaloy.

The fuel element from the Rajasthan Power Station is only 19" long
and does not contain any material other than zircaloy. The end
Pieces are also not very thick. Because the plant would be treat-~

ing boiling water reactor fuel elements a decision in favor of chop-
leach process was taken. In the Kalpakkam (Madras) Reprocessing
Plant it is quite likely that if all fuel to be reprocessed in this
facility is of the Candu type chop leach process would not be favoured
and a chemical decladding process would be adopted. The choice
lies among the Zirflex process, the Thermox process and sulfurjc
acid dissolution. Information available on the Thermox process 0)
and the few experiments carried out in Trombay on the oxidation

of the zircaloy and separation of the insoluble oxide from the dissolver
solution are quite encouraging for the adoption of the process. ,})n

fact an extension of this process to a ""chemical chop' concept(

would reduce the fine oxide to be handled and would leave a large
portion of the zircaloy in compact solid form.

48
The Plant will have 11 to 14 columns depending on the plutonium
purification procedure decided upon. The use of TLA appears attrac-
tive on account of the fewer solvent extraction contactors involved,
and hence a decrease in the cost of equipment. Experiments are bfgsng
carried out in Trombay on the use of TLA for the final purification
as well as on the use of uranous nitrate(?) for the partition and in
the final purification cycle using TBP solvent extraction process.

In any case, for partition, enough experience has been built up in
Trombay on the use of ferrous sulphamate which can be used in the
event of any difficulties in the use of uranous nitrate. The plutonium
purification cycle at the Trombay plant uses ion exchange process.
The performance with respect to decontamination as well as the
capacity of the resin has been quite satisfactory. However, the
final concentrations of the plutonium product have not been as good
as reported. The concentrations obtained in plant scale operation
are invariably lower by a factor upto 2 or 3 than those obtained in
laboratory experiments under identical conditions. This experience
has led to the exploration of the possibilities of other methods.

Based on the results of experiments in progress, provision
will be made for recovery of neptunium-237 from the third uranium
cycle raffinate. The plant is proposed to be operated on high acid
flowsheet for the first two cycles and at lower acidity in the third
uranium cycle.

For the reconversion of plutonium nitrate to plutonium
oxide experiments are being conducted on continuous precipitation
and continuous calcination. Experiments on the residence time
indicated the possibility of designing criticality safe equipment for
throughput of the order of 500 to 600 grams plutonium per hour.

Fast Reactor Fuel Reprocessing

It is generally contended that the economics of power gen-
eration by fast breeder requires reduction in inventory of fissile
material and hence can admit only a very short cooling period
before the irradiated fuel is reprocessed. This contention is
basically valid, but there are other areas of fuel cycle which
contribute more significantly to fuel cycle costs. The proponents
of short cooling time are of the view that reduction in fuel cycle
cost by decreasing cooling time is far easier than reduction of
cost in other areas of the fuel cycle. One has however to balance
this with the problems involved in processing short cooled fuel
elements and the context of such processing.

The choice for fast reactor reprocessing lies between aqueous
and non-aqueous methods. The handicaps adduced to aqueous pro-
cesses are the degradation of the solvent and the consequent effects
on reprocessing efficiency and decontamination factors, criticality
problems and the problem of iodine accumulation and release.

49
Chemical solutions appear to be in sight for minimising the impact
of solvent degradation on efficiency of fuel reprocessing by aqueous
process. (10) This and the development of short residence time
solvent extraction equipment will remove the limitations on aqueous
processing due to solvent degradation. Criticality problems es-
pecially with respect to the dissolver generally appear to be not
insurmountable and can essentially be solved by proper designs and
use of built in poisons in equipment. The iodine problem however
remains to be properly understood and solved.

The non aqueous processes, both the volatility method as well
as the reductive salt transfer method using metal alloys, show great
promise. The technological problems associated with such processes
are not insurmountable in small scale units. It appears therefore
that both the processes should be competative for cloge coupled
systems whereas aqueous methods have potential for larger units.
The problems associated with the transport of short cooled fuel may
necessitate the setting up of close coupled plants in any case and
the economics of aqueous versus non-aqueous methods will have to
be worked out in this context.

The process and technological problems associated with the
fluidised bed fluoride volatility process are the behaviour of
plutonium, the efficiency of conversion of plutonium to its hexa-
fluoride, the decontamination factors with respect to the ruthenium,
the quantitative separation of plutonium from uranium and their
mutual contamination factors, the clogging of off gas filters during
decladding of zircaloy clad fuel by hydrochlorination or hydro-
fluorination and the heat removal during the fluorination. As
mentioned earlier these problems can probably be solved if equip-
ment used are not complicated in shape and design and the capacity
is limited. The fluidised bed fluoride volatility process is essenti-
ally suitable for uranium-235 systems and the introduction of
plutonium into such a system perforce introduces some problems.
While the number of pieces of equipment required for fluoride
volatility system is less than what is required for an aqueous pro-
cess, the materials of construction are more expensive and the
problems of fabrication greater in the light of very stringent re-
quirements of corrosion resistance to fluorides at high temperatures.

A difference in capital investment by a ratio of 3 : 2 is
expected between aqueous and volatility procesges in a plant close
coupled to a 1000 MWe fast reactor station. (llf A reduction in
operating costs by 50 % is also estimated. Such significant ad-
vantage in capital costs may not be available in the Indian context
of lower unit costs of fabrication of equipments and installation
of piping. Similarly the major contribution to decrease in operat-
ing costs is from reduced labour force required. The already
low labour costs in a developing country dilutes the impact of this
aspect of cost reduction.

Madras Fuel Reprocessing Complex

As mentioned earlier, a reprocessing plant for treating
irradiated fuel from 1000 MWe of installed power in the form of
Candu reactors is planned at Kalpakkam near Madras. A Fast
Test Breeder Reactor is also planned for being set up at Kalpakkam.
Considerable amount of development work still remains to be done
in India on the various methods of reprocessing in general and the
reprocessing of fast reactor fuel in particular. Therefore the fuel
reprocessing complex planned at Kalpakkam will consist of facilities
for reprocessing half a tonne a day of Candu type fuel elements
and research and development laboratories in the field of reprocess-
ing. In this complex, facilities will exist for development work
and plant scale operation for the separation of uranium 233 from
thorium irradiated from the fast or thermal reactors and for
developmental work and pilot plant operations of the different
non-aqueous processes. All the production facilities are planned
under one roof to provide for flexibility in the utilisation of per-
sonnel and for economies in common services. The cells and
process equipment will however be different and separate,.

The thermal reactor reprocessing facility would be quite
similar to the one proposed at Tarapur except that the head-end
might be restricted to a chemical chop (Zirflex or Thermox) pro-
cess. The other difference visualised would be the use of mixer
settlers for the partition and final purification cycles, in order to
reduce the height of the cells. This will provide the necessary
plant scale experience in the use of mixer settlers.

The demonstration facility for reprocessing fast reactor fuel
will have a capacity as mentioned above of 1, 6 kg plutonium a day.
The fuel is received in the form of disassembled fuel pins of U0, -
Pu0l; clad in stainless steel approximately 5 mm in outer diamefer.
A simple cutting procedure is preferred for cutting the fuel into
small pieces. A dissolver with product at 90 g uranium and plutonium
per litre is visualised. This will be diluted with nitric acid to
25 to 30 g uranium and plutonium per litre and 3 M in nitric acid.

The fast fuel reprocessing line will have three cycles of
decontamination without the separation of uranium and plutonium.
The first cycle extraction contactor will be a 3 cm diameter
pulsed perforated plate column. All subsequent contactors will
be mixer settlers. The product from the first solvent extraction
cycle is expected to be 30 to 35 g of uranium and plutonium per
litre. After adjusting acidity this will be fed to the second cycle
which will operate under the same conditions as the first cycle.
The third cycle will also be a repetition of the first cycle with
adjustment of acidity based on the nature of the residual fission
products. Evaporation for concentration of aqueous products as
well as high active wastes would be avoided. Provision will be
made for recovery of neptunium-237 to minimise build up of

51
plutonium-238. The uranium and plutonium in the final decontaminated
product would be separated if acquired either by TLA process of if
experiments prove successful by reduction with hydrogen in presence
of platinum catalyst. The uranium product will be stored to allow

the decay of uranium 237 and plutonium will be precipitated as
plutonium oxide for recycle. When the development work on centri-
fugal contactors and stacked clone contactors prove successful the
first solvent extraction column will be replaced by the equipment
which proves most successful in trials.

The production facilities are expected to cost Rs. 75 million
($ 10 million) of which Rs. 45 million can be assigned to the Candu
type fuel reprocessing and Rs. 30 million for fast breeder fuel re-
processing. The research and development laboratory to be set
up separately is expected to cost about Rs. 15 million ($ 2 million).
The approximate cost of reprocessing is expected to be Rs. 125
($ 17) per kg of uranium in the Candu type fuel and Rs. 30, 000
($ 4000) per kg plutonium in fast reactor fuel. These estimates
for capital costs and reprocessing costs are perforce precise only
to an order of magnitude as more details remain to be worked out.
Lack of familiarity with reprocessing high burn-up high plutonium
fuel has introduced an element of cautious conservatism in the cost
estimates for the fast reactor fuel reprocessing.

Conclusion

The figures presented for comparison of costs cannot be
assumed to have long term relevance with respect to absolute
values. It is only recently it has been possible to attempt extra-
polation of available data on the economics of reprocessing for
long term planning. The results of the preliminary studies have
brought out the interesting features with respect to Indian conditions.
With the setting up and operation of the Tarapur Plant, the data will
acquire better precision. The trend of increase in labour costs in
India will have a significant impact on the construction and operating
costs in the future on account of the appreciable labour component.
The size of the optimum plant will thereby increase and this trend
will be supported by an increase in the size of nuclear power stations
and improvements in transportation by rail and road.

It is foreseen that for sometime to come fast reactor fuels
are best reprocessed in close -coupled plants, avoiding thereby
the additional technological problems of safe transportation of
high burn-up plutonium bearing fuel. Aqueous reprocessing with
modifications and refinements has become the universal method
for thermal reactor fuels on account of the proved performance
with respect to economics as well as process efficiency. For
fast reactor fuels the choice will remain open for quite some
time. While aqueous methods do not have insurmountable pro-
blems for extension to high burn up short cooled fuels, non aqueous

52
methods offer an attractive alternative, especially for reprocess-
ing plants coupled to fast reactors upto about 1000 MWe. The
Indian programme visualises development work in the various
non aqueous processes as well as on short residence solvent
extraction contactors for aqueous processing in connection with
the reprocessing of irradiated fuel from fast reactors.

Melt refining is-the neme given to the process of selective
removal of fission products from highly irradiated metallic reactor
fuel by & high-temperature oxidation step in which the ceramic
crucible is the source of oxygen. Volatilization of fission products
contributes to the overall fission-product removal., Data obtained
from four years of totally remote operation with irradiated fuel
has, in general, confirmed theoretical and laboratory-obtained
results. The purified metal is remotely refabricated into fuel
elements for reinsertion in the reactor (EBR-II).

¥Work performed under the auspices of the United States Atomic
Energy Commission.

I. Introduction

Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II) is an unmoderated,
heterogenecus, sodium-cooled fast breeder reactor with a power
output of 62.5 megawatts of heat (1). The energy produced in
the reactor is converted to 20 megawatts of electricity through
gsodium~to-water heat exchangers and a conventional steam cycle,
The plant was built under the suspices of the USAEC as a demon-
stration central-station fast breeder reactor.

The nuclear driver fuel of EBR-II currently consists of metallic
uranium enriched to 52.18% in the U235 isctope and alloyed with 5%
fissium.” When approximately 1.2 to 2 atom percent of the uranium
in the fuel has fissioned, the fuel 1s discharged from the reactor
and processed to remove fission products, re-enrich the alloy, and
restore its original metallurgical and nuclear properties. Pro-
cessing is accomplished by melt refining in the direectly adjoining
Fuel Cycle Facility (2,8) which is an integral part of the EBR-II
cecmplex,

The Fuel Cycle Facility consists of a conventional rectangular
air-atmosphere hot cell and a circular argon-atmosphere cell
(Fig. 1). The two cells are joined by a lock system. All process
operations that expose fuel directly 1o the atmosphere take place
in the argon cell. Operations involving fuel that is protected by
a stainless steel jacket or cladding are accomplished in the air-
atmosphere cell., Since the process does not remove all classes
of fission products from the fuel, all processing operations are
totally remote.

Feed for the process is an irradiated fuel subassembly from
the reactor. The product is a newly reconstituted and re-enriched
fuel subassembly ready for insertion in the reactor.

A pyrochemical process was chosen for EBR-II because of its
promise of reducing the reprocessing cost associated with nuclear
power. The principal characteristics of the process which promise
reduced costs are 1ts simplicity, compactness, low volume of dry
active wastes, and capability for handling short-cooled fuels with

¥Fissium is a term used to represent a mixture of fission product
elements (atomic numbers 40 to 46) which when alloyed with uranium
impart to the alloy desirable metallurgical and radiation-sta-
bility properties. In this fuel, concentrations of fission-
product alloying elements are: 2,5 w/o molybdenum, 2 w/o ru-
thenium, 0.26 w/o rhodium, 0.19 w/o palladium, 0.1 w/o zirconium,
0.04% w/o silicon, and 0,01 w/o niobium. Silicon (0.04 w/o) is
added to improve the radiation stability of the fuel.

the reduced criticality problem agsociated with small volumes of
metallic fuels in the absence of nuclear moderators(2). No attempt
will be made to evaluate the economics of the overall process,
sinee this paper is concerned only with the results produced by
melt refining.

Melt refining was chosen as the specific pyrochemical demonstra-
{ion process for the metallie fuel of EBR-II, A large number of
parametric studies (3) were made to aid in predicting the
disposition and. interactions of individual fission products and to
define the physiecal specifications for the process, These studies
were made on & amall scale with either inactive or tracer-level
materials., However, some of the variables, such as buildup of
isotopes of uranium with continual recycle, could not be verified
in small-scale runs. Two of the primery objectives for the operation .
of the melt refining process in the Fuel Cycle Facility were to
eveluate the veracity of the small-scale experiments relative to
full-scale (both size and activity level) runs, and to demon-
strate that a pyrochemical process could be operated on a full-
plant scale by totally remote means for a meaningful period of
time. With regard to the chemistry of the process, the full-scale
raus tornfirmed the experimental amd theoreticnl predictions.

With regard to the time period, the successful operation for more
than four years by totally remote means exceeded the original
design specifications for the demonstration of this process.

II. Head-End Processing Steps

The fuel subassemblies are 92 in. long, are hexagonal in shape,
and contain 91 enriched uranium-alloy fuel elements (clad pins).
The fuel pins are 13.5 in. long by 144 mils in diameter, and are
sealed in e stainless steel can (O mil wall) which is 18 in., long.
The 6-mil annulus between the fuel pin and the cladding wall is
filled with sodium which acts as 8 heat transfer medium during
power operation.

The external surfaces of s subassembly (Fig. 2) are covered
with residual sodium after removel from the reactor. The sodium
is removed from the subassembly in the interbuilding coffin (2)
by an oxidation and water-dissolution procedure. After sodium
removal, the subassembly is transferred to the air cell for mechani~
cal dismantling. Individual fuel elements are transferred toc the
argon cell, where they are mechanically decanned and chopped into
1.5 in. sections for ease of handling (2, 8). The chopped, sodium~
coated fuel is ready for melt refining. Refabrication of new fuel
elements from the melt-refined fuel is described in an accompanying
paper (10).

III. Description of Melt Refining

The irradiated, chopped fuel and a precalculated quantity of
re~enrichment uranium is charged to a lime-stabilized zirconium
oxide crucible.® Zirconium oxide was preferred to other ceramics
because contamination of the melt by the substrate metal (Zr) is
negligible, and pouring yields from ZrOp crucibles were somewhat
better than those from the other ceramics considered (3). In
addition, zirconia provided better cerium removel.

The crucible is placed in a sealed furnace (2), and the fuel alloy
is melted and liquated for 3 hrs at 1400°C under an inert argon
atmosphere. During the run, the crucible is covered with a ceramic-
fiber fume trap which has been shown effective in trapping cesium
and iodine (CsI){6). After purification, the fuel alloy is chill-
cast into a graphite ingot mold. This process is termed melt
refining (2,3).

Melt refining removes three classes Of fission products from the
fuel, and these represent about two-thirds of the total fission
yield. The chemically inert fission gases xenon and krypton are
evolved on melting (3). Fission products such as bromine, iodine,
and cesium, which have high vapor pressure at 1400°C, are volatil-
ized and trapped by the fume trap (3,5,6). Chemically reactive
fission products, such as yttrium, strontium, barium, lanthanum,

and the lanthanide elements, react with the oxygen in the zirconia
crucible to form oxides. These oxides remain with the crucible
when the alloy is poured into the mold, Fig. 3 (3, 5).

One group of fission products, atomic numbers 4O through 46, are
not removed by the melt refining process. Zirconium, atomic
number 4O, has exhibited fractional removals, but this is attributed
10 reaction with carbon and other impurities in the alloy rather
than to the oxidative process, These fission products constitute
the so-called fissium elements. For the first core lecading of
EBR-II, it was felt advisable not to start with a pure uranium fuel,
which has undesirable metallurgical and radiation-stability
charascteristics, and would be subject to compositional changes
during each resctor-processing pass. Instead, the steady-state
concentrations of fissium metals in recycled fuel were calculated
as a function of fissien yield, percent burnup, melt refining re-
actions, dross (skull) purification and recycle (7), and pouring
yields. This calculated composition was chosen as the alloy for
the first core loading of EBR-II (4) (see footnote p. 1).

¥The approximate compostion of the crucible is: Cal0 , 5 w/o;
HfOp, 2 w/o; Si0p, 0.7 w/o; Alp03, 0.5 w/o; Ti02, 0.3 w/o;
Fe203, 0.3 w/o; balance ZrOz.

3. Fission Product Removal in Melt Refining

63
IV, Melt Refining Performance

1. Fission Product Removals

Considerable preoperational research was done on the behavior
of many of the fission products during melt refining ( 3 ),
For direct comparison with current work, the most important work
was that of Trice and Steunenberg (5). They completed a series
of small-scale melt refining experiments (400-g charges) with
highly irradiated EBR-II-type fuel and determined fission product
distributions as well as removals. From these experiments, it was
concluded that uranium, molybdenum, and ruthenium show no preference
for the ingot or skull, and distribute directly according tc the
pouring yield. The removels of rere earths, tellurium, iodine,
cesium, and barium-strontium were generally 99% or better. The
single determination on plutonium hinted at a very slight partitioin
to the oxide,

Plant-scale runs typically involve 10- to 12-kg charges of
irradiated fuel plus makeup enriched uranium. The melt refining
crucivle is 9-1/2 in, high by 6-3/8 in. in dismeter, and is covered
by a Fiberfrax*(2) fume trap with dimensions of 10 in. in diameter
by 5-1/4 in. high. Because of the large size of these components
and the high levels of activity involved, sampling of these com-
ponents was difficult and complete fission-product distributions
were not obtained for plant operation.

For the same reasons, and because of the heavy analytical load
of routine fuel analyses (uranium, plutonium, noble metals, and
trace impurities), complete fission-product analyses were not
obtained for each run. Certain fisslon products were selected as
representative of major classes.

Cesium and ilodine were selected as representative of those
elements having high volatility. Barium,lanthanum and cerium
were selected as representative of the chemicelly reactive group,
with cerium as a representative for rare esrths, The behavior
of the gaseous fission products (xenon, krypton) was so well
established that they were not checked,

For plant startup, 1400°C and 3 hrs of liquation were chosen
as the initial melt-refining paremeters. These runs were made
primerily to confirm that plant-scale results would agree with
leboratory-scale results. Accordingly, removals for these con-
ditions are presented first, The removals for the volatile and
the chemically reactive groups were generally 98.5% or better.

*Fiberfrax is a trade name of the Carborundum Company for a ceramic
fiber composed of alumina and silica.

64
Plutonium exhibited a slight preference for the skull, showing
approximately 5% removal from the refined alloy. The noble metals
distributed directly according to pouring yield.

Data obteined from these early runs confirmed that 3 hrs and
1400°C are adequate conditions for acceptable. fission product
removals, They essentially duplicate the data from the small-
scale experiments ( 5). The results also confirm that technetium
may be considered a noble metal. The stability of the noble mefald
is more clearly presented in the next section {IV-3). The data for
pluto?i?m are at low concentration levels, but they confirm previous
work (3).

Off-gases from the melt refining furnace pass first through the
in-cell filter containing a 2-in. layer of activated carbon and a
high-efficiency glass filter medium, then through a vacuum pump
and an oil separator to a shielded holdup tank (500 cu ft) con-
taining 1000 1b of activated carbon. When meteorological con-
ditions are favorable, the gas in the holdup tank is discharged
through a heated (430°F) bed of silver-nitrate-coated packing
(silver nitrate tower), through a bank of high-efficiency filters
for removal of submicron particles, and through a 200-ft high
stack to the stmosphere,

Prior to plant startup, two experiments were performed in the
plant furnaces to evaluate the behavior and distribution of iodine
In one of these experiments, one wire of 1131 {as palladium iodide
which decomposes at 350°C) was added to 8 kg of fuel and melt re-
fined at 1400°C for 3 hrs. During refining, the charge contained
in the Zr02 crucible is covered by the fume trap. The fume trap
collected ~ 80% of the I13l, ~20% distributed to metallic surfaces
in the furnace assembly, and the crucible and skull retained approxi-
mately 2%. Of the small amount that reached the in-cell filter
(0.3 mCi), only 0.3% passed through it (as is typical of most radia-
chemical determinations, the material balance is not perfect).

Very minor amounts (0.1%) of the originsl iodine eventually appearad
in the cell atmosphere.

In a companion experiment, 1 Ci of elemental iodine was intro-
duced into the pipe entering the off-gas delay tank at a point
downstream of the in-cell filter and the exhaust pumps. Approxi-
mately 25% of the charge (250 mCi) reached the tank. Three suc-
cessive pumpouts (following backfilling with argon) resulted in a
total of 0.14 mCi of TI13l being extracted from the tank. The
percentage passed by the tank charcoal was thus 6 x 10'5% (11).

Following the confirmation of the initial parameters, data
were obtained to ascertain the effect of liguation time while
maintaining the 1400°C liquation temperature. Table 1 presents
these data.

65
During a typical melt-refining run, 2 hrs elapses between the
start of the run and the time at which 1400°C is reached. The
EBR-IT fissium alloy melts in the range 1030 +to 108000, so the
alloy has normally been molten for 20 to 30 min before 1400°C
is reached. From the data of Table 1, it is concluded that cesium
and barium~lanthanum are effectively removed from the bulk alloy
upon reaching 1L400°C. Todine is also effectively removed in rela-
tively short liquation time at 14OOC (it has been shown that the
iodine is normally deposited after volatilization as an iodide,
primarily CsI (6),

The removal of cerium, and presumably the other rare earths, on
the other hand, is strongly time-dependent at 1400°C, The cerium
data are plotted in Fig, 4 for illustration. This time dependency
was not observed in the small-scale runs where the time was varied
between 1 and 3 hrs. However, this is not unexpected, since the
crucible contact-surface-to-volume ratio of the small-scale runs
was a factor of three larger than for the plant-scale runs. It
has been shown that diffusion through the reaction zone is probably
the controlling process for cerium removal (3, 9, 10). Thus,
it is reasonable that a 1-hr liquation in small-scale geometry
should produce the same results as a 3-hr ligquation in the plant-
scale crucible. Either of them would essentially effect quantita-
tive (98-99%) removal of cerium, and additional liquation time
would not produce a significant increase in removal of cerium.

Scme data were obtained tco assess the effect of temperature on
fission-product remocvals. Because of plant operational require-
ments, however, the determinations were over relatively narrow
temperature ranges.

At 3 hrs, no effect of temperature was discernible within the

accuracy of analytical results for Cs, Ba-La, or Ce. In order to
accentuate any change that may have occurred, the tests with 2-hr

Cesium shows no temperature effect over the range considered.

The data for I131 are too incompléte to allow conclusions.

Pre-

vious work had shown complete removal at 1400°C and at least 90%
removal at 1300°C (3). Barium-lanthanum was removed quantitatively
during all the 3-hr runs checked, but it did exhibit a slight
lowering of removal for a 2-hr liguation at 1300°C. Extension of

the tempersture range would probably amplify this effect, con-
sidering the chemical similarity of barium, lanthanum and cerium.

The data for cerium are interesting. No apparent temperature
dependence is exhibited for 3-hr liquations, but there appears a
fairly strong dependence for 2-hr liquations. To correctly estimate
the magnitude, the time effect must be subtracted ocut before the tem-
perature dependence is established. The data are too meager, however,
to allow this separation.

The final conclusion about the cerium behavior is that there
exists a combined time-temperature dependence that would aliow
some parametric juggling in the operation of & melt-refining pro-
cessing plant. In general, the data for the elements investigated
confirm laboratory and theoretical estimates, and appropriate choice
of parameters will provide adeguate fission-product removals.

2. Gross Gamma Activity Distribution

Gross radiation distribution measurements were taken for one of
the early melt refining runs (all readings are at 1 ft). The feed
materials {corrected for decay) showed an input tc the run of 7 x
10k R/hr (12)- After being refined, the activity distribution on
the various components showed the following:

Reading Percentage of
(R/nr) Total

Refined Ingot L.5 x 103 8
Crucible (1.5 x 104) ) y

+ Skull (3.5 = 107) 5.0 x 10 8h

Fume Trap 4,0 x 103 8

Ingot Mold 3 _—

Total 6 x 10% 100

The charge for this run averaged 0.4 a/o (atom percent) burnup.
At 1 a/o burnup, %ocalized radiation readings would fall in the
range of 102 - 10 R/hr. The difference between charge and product
can be attributed to self-shielding in the ingot and gas evolution
from the refined alloy. The subsequent high radiation background
within the shielded cells precluded repeating this experiment with
fuel containing a higher activity level,

3. Alloy Compositional Stability and Plutonium Buildup

As noted previously, the initial "equilibrium" core loading
for EBR-II was calculated from knowledge of the behavior of the
various fission products in the melt refining process. Compositional
varilations were later followed in one batch of fuel that was re-
cycled five times between the reactor and the processing-refabri-
cation cycle. The fuel received 1 to 1.2 afo burnup each cyele in
the reactor. None of this fuel was intermixed with other batches
during this experiment and the only compesitional adjustments made
were to add sufficient U-235 each cycle to compensate for that
consumed in the reactor.

After five cycles, the composition of the fuel had not changed
{(within analytical accuracy) except for zirconium, silicon,
plutonium, technicium, and U-23L plus U236. These starting con-
centrations for these elements and the concentrations after five
cycles are shown in Table 3.

Table 3

EBR-II Fuel-Alloy Composition Changes

Composition After

Element {w/o) Cycles (w/o)
Uranium-236 0 09 0.52
Plutonium None C.12
Technecium None .05
Zirconium 0.10 0.09
Silicon 0.01 0.07

The concentrations of plutonium and technieium increased
because they are formed in the reactor and are not selectively
removed in melt refining. Neither of them was present in the initial
alloy composition., A slight increase in U-236 is also apparent.
This isotope is formed in the reactor as a result of the n, &
reaction on U-235., No separation of urenium isotopes results
from melt refining.

The increase in silicon concentration comes from small amounts
of the Vycor (quartz) molds that enter the melt during the sub-
sequent injection-casting operation. Continuved recycle of the metal
resulted in a steady increase of silicon. No attempt was made to
remove silicon, since postirradiation surveillance of the fuel showed
that fuel with silicon contents in the range of 200-800 ppm ex-
hibited less radiation damage than the fuel containing the original
concentration of silicon (50-100 ppm).

The total fission yield of zirconium is greater than that of any
other noble metal in the alloy. If zirconium were not removed from
the alloy by some mechanism, it would grow at the expense of the
other noble-metal concentrations. The current alloy compesitions
show that, if anything, zirconium has slowly decreased in concentra-
tion. The analytical data for zirconium typically exhibit wide
variance, and no estimate of the percentage of removal is attempted.
The removal of zirconium has been correlated with the presence of
carbon and cerium in the alloy ( 3)., The staviiity of the
alloy is readily spparent and confirms criginal estimates of the
behavior of the process.

L, Silicon Addition

As mentioned above, it was desirable to increase the silicon

70

concentration of the alloy to about 400 ppm. Other investigators

who attempted to add silicon to uranium melts noted that quanti-

tative alloying was difficult to achieve; several experiments were
therefore conducted at FCF to determine the best way to add silicon
to EBR-II driver fuel. The methods that were considered were; (1)
direct addition of silicon metal to uranium-fissium-alloy melts,

(2) direct addition of a uranium-silicon master alloy to the uranium-
figsium-alloy melts, (3) direct addition of fissium silicides to
uranium-fissium-alloy melts, and (L) direct addition of silicon dioxide
to uranium-fissium-alloy melts.

Table 4 shows the results of initially adding silicon metal to
the charge (uranium and uranium - 5 w/o fissium) before alloying
at 1400°C.

An interesting point that resulted from the experiment is that
86.5 £ 1.5% of the silicon initially charged remained with the
product for each case.

Two experiments were conducted where silicon was added to a
uranium - 5 w/o fissium melt through a master alloy. The master
alloy was composed of U-238 and silicon (1.86 w/o Si). The
desired final composition was 400 ppm Si. Results indicate that
a near-perfect stoichiometric silicon pickup is possible when
silicon is added by the master alloy method., This method is
presently being used at the Fuel Cycle Facility for silicon addition
to alloy melts.

71
Zirconium disilicide was added directly to an allcy preparation
charge ag a means of adding zirconium and silicon to the fissium
alloy. Results indicated that 100% of the silicon and 85% of the
zirconium alloyed with the product.

Vycor glass tubing (99.9% Si02) was added to a depleted-uranium
charge. The oxygen introduced as Si02 reduced the melt yield;
therefore, this technique was not used for adding silicon to the
fuel alloy.

5. Melt-Refining Pour Yields and Throughput

The yield of one melt refining operation is defined as the ratio
of the weight of the chill-cast ingot to the total weight of spent
fuel, enrichment adjustments (U-235 and U-238), and fissium elements
charged to the furnace before the melt. The throughput at melt
refining is defined as the total weight of alloy processed per week
in the melt refining furnaces (there are two furnaces in the EBR-II,
FCF). The throughput is directly related to the yield of each melt
refining operation.

The pouring yleld in melt refining is dependent on & number of
conditions, such as charge size and geomeiry, furnace atmosphere,
and crucible material. These conditions were not varied for the
melt refining runs. The conditions that were investigated were the
effect of liguation time, liguation temperature, and fission product
concentration (percent burnup).

For what were defined as standard operating conditions, i.e.,

3 hrs of liquation in a zirconia crucible at 1400°C, the effect of
burnup on pouring yield is shown in Fig. 5 The straight line is
a least-squares fit of data points obtained.

The effect of liquation times or temperatures on pouring yield
could not be separated from the effect of fission-product removal.
Pouring yilelds are directly dependent on the quantity of dross
produced. Iower temperatures and the resulting lower reaction
rates would require longer reaction {liquation) times to produce
the same fission-product removals. Previous work with unirradiated
uranium showed that the dross consisted of 10 to 20% oxidized metal
and 80 to 90% occluded metal. This work also showed that higher
pouring temperatures resulted in higher yields. This is probably
a result of a lower viscosity of the matrix metal at higher temper-
atures, which results in better "draining" of the occluded metal
from the dross.

The highest temperature consistent with equipment limitations
was selected, 1400°C. This resulted in a 3-hr liquation time
which was consistent with a single shift (8 hrs) overall operating
cycle for the melt refining furnace.

In addition to refining the spent fuel, one of the necessary jcbs
of the melt refining furnaces is to consclidate the recycle material
being returned from the refabrication process. This material comes
in two bulk forms, 'heels" and "shards.," An explanation of the
sources of this material is given in an accompanying paper(10). A
summary of the consolidation and melt refining operation carried
out in the melt refining furnace is given in Table 5.

The average throughput of alloy per furnace during normal pro-
cessing periods was x 25 kg per week, This included both spent
and recycle fuel. The total amount of fuel refined in the Fuel
Cycle Facility and the total weilght processed through melt refining
is shown in Table 5 (two furnaces).

Summary

In the work reported on in this paper, two areas are of partic-
ular interest. The first is that the melt refining process is the
first demonstration of pyrochemical processing of reactor fuel
on a full-plant scale. The second is that equipment can be de-
signed to be operated by totally remote means on a productive
schedule, and can maintain this schedule for over four years of
continuous operation,

The data obtained from these operations essentially confirm
data that had previously been obtained on unirradiated or small-
scale runs. This is noteworthy and encouraging in that designers
of future pyrochemical processes may continue tc have confidence
in data that were derived from laboratory or theoretical results,
The melt refining furnaces were installed in the shielded cells in
1963. They were tested with unirradiated uranium melts, and in
1964 the first melts with irradiated fuel were conducted. During
the 4-1/2 years that the two melt-refining furnaces were in oper-
ation in the argon cell, a total of almost 600 runs of 10 to 12 kg
each were made in these furnaces. The majority of the runs were
made for purification of the reactor fuel. The remainder were
made for blending of new (unirradiated) alloy or for consolidation
of recycle material.

The modular design of the furnaces permitted remote repair or
replacement of any components that had failed. The longevity of
the equipment and the ease with which repairs could be made re-
affirmed the desirability of proper design and precperational
testing of all equipment that must be operated remotely. The over-
all operating availability of both furnaces for the past four years
exceeded 85% of operating time.

The melt-refining process used for purifying the highly irradi-
ated EBR-IT metallic fuel does not remove all of the fission products,
hence refabrication of the product fuel must be done remotely. The
steps inveolved in refabrication of fuel elements and subassemblies
are: injection casting, pin processing (shearing and inspection),
loading into a sodium-filled jacket, welding the jJacket closed and
leak testing, bonding the sodium in the jacket, and assembling the
completed elements into a subassembly. The subassemblies are rein-
serted into the reactor. Nearly 35,000 fuel pins and elements have
been fabricated by totally remote processing to tolerances of one
mil or less. Process variables and yields for each step of the
process have been investigated.

Introduction

The reprocessing of fuel from Experimental Breeder Reactor II
(EBR-II) requires a system of sophisticated equipment operated re-
motely in two large cells of the Fuel Cycle Facility (FCF). The
fuel itself is an alloy of 52 %-enriched uranium and 5 w/o fissium.
The fissium consists of fission-product elements (molybdenium,
rhodium, ruthenium, palladium, zirconium, and niobium) that are not
removed by pyrometallurgical processing.il) In the FCF the first
series of operations includes fuel handling, decanning, and melt
refining, as described in an accompanying paper. 1) The following
series of operations, the refabrication steps, are described in this
paper,

In the argon cell, the first step is that of melting the refined
ingot and injection casting the uranium alloy into Vycor molds.
Next, in the pin processing operation, the fuel pins are removed
from the molds, sheared to length, and inspected for length, weight,
diameter, and internal porosity. Acceptable pins are loaded into
stainless steel Jackets containing a precisgely measured quantity of
sodium. An end closure (restrainer) is inserted in the jacket and
the final closure weld completed. These fuel elements are trans-
ferred to the air cell where the closure weld is leak tested. The
final element operations are sodium bonding and sodium bond testing.
Acceptable elements are fabricated into subassemblies, which, after
final acceptance testing, are returned to the reactor.

Three other operations involved in fabrication are not accomplished
by remote means. The stainless steel jackets are fabricated from
purchased components, and each Jjacket is lcaded with a carefully
measured quantity of sodium. Other stainless steel components are
purchased and fabricated into preassemblies, which when combined with
g1 fuel elements, form a completed subassembly. A summary of operating
experience in the FCF is presented at the end of the report.

Injection Casting(2)

Two of the requirements for the reactor fuel were that the dia-
meter (0.1h4Y4 in.) had to be closely controlled, and the grain strue-
ture had to be randomly oriented. To combine these factors with
remote operation, an essentizlly new process had to be developed.
Using a casting process together with controlled cocoling solved the
random grein structure. The diameter problem was resolved by forcing
the molten metal into tubes with a precision bore. After considerable
development work, the injection-casting furnace shown in Fig. 1 was
ready for use in FCF.(3,;4) With minor modifications, the furnaces
have been used to produce fuel pins in the argon cell since 1964, A
production summary is given in Table I.

THOz COATED, GRAPHITE
CRUCIBLE (ELEVATED POSITION)

1. Fuel Cycle Facility Injection Casting Furnace
The ingot from melt refining is placed in a thoria (ThOp)-coated
graphite crucible, which is positioned on a zirconia insulation
pedestal in the furnace. A pallet stand holds approximately 100
Vycor* molds above the crucible. The cylindrical molds are sealed
at the top end, have a precision bore, and also are coated with thoria.
Around the crucible (which also serves as a susceptor) is the in-
duction heater. The induction coil is an uncocled, 3/8-in.-dia
solid molybdenum coil, which is powered by a 10,000-cycle, 30-kW
motor generator. Temperature control of the melt is cobtained by
using a platinum-rhodium immersion thermocouple sheathed in a sealed
tantalum tube. The thermocouple passes through the center of the
pallet to the crucible. There is a backup thermocouple located under-
neath the graphite crucible. A gastight chamber is formed by a
furnace bell in combination with a Bi-Sn eutectic-alloy freeze seal
(Cerro-tru).

After the furnace is charged and the seal frozen, a vacuum of 50-
100 1 is obtained. The charge is heated to 1350° C, and the automatic
casting cycle is initiated. This raises the crucible into the elevated
position so that the molds are immersed approximately 1-1/2 in. into
the melt. Since the molds are relstively cold, a plug of metal forms
in the tube. The molds are therefcre held in the melt for a short
time (8 sec) before the furnace is pressurized to 1.7 atmospheres
(abs.). The pressure drives the molten metal up into the evacuated
molds. After 2 sec, the metal begins to freeze in the molds, at
which time the crucible is lowered to its original position and a
flow of cooling is recirculated over the molds. The furnace is
cooled for approximately 4 hrs (to a crucible temperature of less
than 200° C), the seal is melted, and the furnace is unloaded. The
fuel ping in the Vycor molds are transferred to pin processing; the
heel remaining in the crucible is broken and recycled to melt refining
or rerun in the injection-casting furnace. One fuel pin has several
small pieces cut from its center, and these samples are sent to an
adjacent laboratory for chemical analysis,

Pin Processing

The pin processing operation consists of several individual
steps.( :5) Each step is performed by an equipment module that can
be individually replaced. The eguipment modules are supported on a
cascade base that contains the necessary pneumatic and electrical
connections., These service connections are automatically msde when
the module is placed into position on the base frame. A complete
set of spare equipment modules is provided so that when repairs are
required on a module, the spare module can be installed and the pin
processing operation can continue.

*Jyeor is the trade name for high-silica glasses from Corning
Glass Works.,

1. Demolding: Vycor glass molds are removed from the castings
by placing the castings, one at a time, onto a slot formed by two
parallel hard-faced bars spaced slightly closer than the mold dia-
meter. A single flat-edge blade powered by & pneumgtic ram pushes
the mold between the parallel bhars, breaking the glass from the fuel
pin. The broken glass is collected in a metal container located
underneath the demclder. The cast fuel pin falls downward to a pair
of rails and rolls to the front face of the democlder.

2. Sheering Station: The cast fuel pin is placed into the shear
from the top, and drops into shearing position between spring-loaded
pressure pads and the shear tools. One set of shear tools is sta-
tionary while the second set is mounted in a movable block which is
actuated by a pneumatic cylinder. Both ends of the pin are simul-
taneously sheared to produce a 13.5-in. length when the movable blades
slide past the stationary blades. The shear blades are fabricated of
hardened tool steel (Super High Speed Coballoy), and have four cutting
edges that can be rotated into position for shearing. Each cutting
edge will normally shear 1000 to 1500 castings before failing.

3. Length-Measuring and Weighing Station: After shearing, the.
fuel pin drops through the shear station and rolls down inclined
rails below the shear to the length-measuring stetion. The length is
measured by forcing the pin longitudinally ageinst a dimension-
measuring transducer by means of a pneumatically operated ram. When
the ram is released, the pin rolls down inclined rails to the balance,
The deflection of the balance is measured through a transducer system,
A movable rail section on the top of the balance raises the pin off
the balance and sllows the pin to roll down to the diameter- and
porosity-checking station.

4, Diameter and Porosity: From the previous station, the fuel
pin falls onto a longitudinal set of rails and is fed into an air
gauge by means of a push-rod mechanism operated by an electric motor.
The air gauge and an eddy-current coll are mounted inside a removable
brass block, and the pin is pushed through the air gauge and the
eddy-current coil simultaneously,

5. Data Recording System: Signals from the in-cell pin- proces-
sing equipment are fed to a data recording and processing system
located outside the cell in the coperating annulus. The signals for
length and weight are converted intc numerical values and displayed
on a digital voltmeter. Pin-diameter values are integrated over the
pin length and used by the data system to calculate the pin volume.
The signal from the eddy-current porosity cecil is fed into a recorder
which plots the results on a strip chart. The data system operates
a key-punch machine which punches the casting-batch number, pin
number (determined by pin sequence during processing), length, weight,
and volume for each fuel pin on a data card. This data card then

81
becomes the permanent fabrication record for the fuel pin, and is
used for accountebility and criticelity-control purpcoses in all sub-
sequent fabrication steps.

The operator reviews the data as exhibited on the data recording
system, and then makes a decision whether o sccept or reject the
pin. Rejects are transferred to a separate tray, chopped into seg-
ments, 3 to 4 in. long, and recycled to melt refining. The identity
of accepted pins from this station forward throughout the balance of
the operations is maintained with the data card by positioning the
pins in specific locations of various receptacles,

Jacket PFabrication

Long before the pins that will be loaded into the jackets are
cast, the stainless steel components rust be purchased and fabricated.
Each Jjacket consists of four components: tube, tip, spacer wire, and
restrainer. The first three are manufactured from Type 304L stain-
less steel, and the last from Type 304 stainless steel.

The tubing is of welded construction with an inside diameter of
0,1560 * 0.0005 in. and a wall thickness of 0,0090 X 0,0005 in. An
extensive testing program is carrie% 3ut on the tubing, including
100% pulsed eddy-current inspection 6) for wall defects. The maxi-
mum acceptable defect level is 10% of the wall thickness. Acceptable
tubing is cut te length and a bottom tip is heliarc-welded to each
piece. The spacer wire, 0.049 * 0.0005 in. in diameter, is heliarc-
welded to the tip and wrapped around the tube with a 6-in. pitch.

The top end of the wire is welded to the tube with a capacitor-
discharge welder. The jackets are inspected and the internal

82
volume 1s determined as described in the next section. The re-
strainers, which are fabricated and inspected elsewhere, are cleaned
and taken into the argon cell at the same time ag the sodium-filled
jackets.

Sodium Loading

Sodium is employed in the 0,006-in.-thick annulus between the
fuel pin and the element cladding to provide heat transfer from the
fuel pin.(7) A precise amount of sodium is placed in each element
80 as to leave a maximum gas-plenum volume to accommodate irradiation
swelling of the fuel and yet keep the fuel pin completely covered
with sodium during reactor service. The sodium loading operation
consists of two parts -- jacket prepasration and sodium-charge pre-
paration.

Jacket preparation consists of a visual inspection, leak testing,
and meagsurement of the internal volume. The visual inspection is
employed to detect damage which may have occurred during shipping,
as well as to provide a double check for defective welds which may
have been missed during the fabrication inspecticn. The Jackets are
leak tested by pressurizing the interior of the jacket with helium
and analyzing air flow passing the exterior of the jacket with a
masg spectrometer. The test is capable of detecting leak rates of
10-8 sta cc/sec at a pressure difference of L atmospheres. The
internal volume of each Jjacket is measured by utilizing a motorized
alr gauge coupled to an electronic integrating circuit. Each jacket
is placed in one of ten classifications depending on its internal
diameter. Each class varies from the next by 0.0001 in. in the
range of 0,1555 to 0.1565 in.

Sodium-charge preparation consists of calculating the weight of
sodium required, extruding sodium into wire, cutting and weighing
lengths of the wire, and placing the charges in the Jjackets. The
weight of sodium required for each element (0.65 to 0.85 g) is
calculated by subtiracting the average volume of the fuel pins of
a casting batch from the average volume of the jacket class to be
used. One of the factors that affects the sodium level is the
volume reduction which accompanies the transformation of the uranium
alloy from the gamma phase to the alpha phase during the bonding
operation. Complete transformgtion of the entire fuel pin causes
a volume decrease of about 0.035 cc (about 1% of the originsl pin
volume). Experience has shown that only about 0.026 cc (0.025 g)
of sodium must be added to the calculated sodium charge to achieve
the desired sodium level in the element, because the entire pin is
not retained in the garma phase during the injection-casting oper-
ation. The sodium charge is obtained by extruding sodium (obtained
from the reactor's secondary sodium system) through a die at room
temperature into l/8-in.-dia.wire. The wire is cut to precise
lengths by using a special cutter which permits wvariation of the

83
length of the wire with a micrometer adjustment. The lengths of
sodium wire are weighed to check the accuracy of the cut and are
placed in the Jjackets. All the operationg requiring sodium handling
are carried out in an argon-filled glovebox (impurity levels: Op -
20 to 60 ppm; HpO - 20 to 60 ppm; No - 0.5% max).

Average values for pin volume and jacket volume are used for
calculating the sodium charge for each element, so the final sodium
levels of the individual elements vary slightly. Levels between
0.50 and 0.80 in. above the fuel pins are acceptable (Fig. 2). Less
than 3% of the elements fabricated have been rejected because of high
or low sodium levels,

Settling and Welding

The Jjackets containing the sodium charges are transferred to the
argon cell in sealed polyethylene bags. The fuel pins are placed in
the Jjackets and heated to allow the pins to displace the sodium and
settle to the bottom of the jacket; then the combination fuel re-
strainer and end plug can be inserted into the top of the jacket.
The restrainer's purpose is to prevent gross fuel movement during
irradiation by ratcheting mechanisms. The restrainer is sealed to
the top end of the element tubing by means of a capacitor discharge
weld (Fig. 3). This method was developed to provide a reliable,
remotely operated welding machine for very thin-wall tubing. The
weld is accomplished by placing the top of the end plug of the
element 0,040 in, from a tungsten electrode, preheating the top of
the element for 5 sec. with a high-frequency discharge, and discharg-
ing a 0.17-farad capacitor bank charged to 150 V across the ionized
path between the electrode and the end plug. The capacitor dis-
charge fuses the end plug to the top of the jacket, thus sealing
the element.

The primary reason for rejection of welds is improper alignment
of the electrode with respect to the top of the end plug, which
causes a misshaped weld with lack of fusion on one side of the
element. There are two other causes of unacceptable welds that
occur less frequently: (a) contamination of the 1lip of the jacket
with sodium causes blowouts, and (b) improperly shaped (blunted)
electrode tips cause misshaped welds. The overall acceptance rate
for the closure weld is almost 97% (see Table IT).

Since the fuel pins and bonding sodium gare now protected, the
elements are moved to the air cell for subseguent operations,

determining a leak rate by the loss of pressure from a very small
volume over a period of time., The system has many advantages over
more common methods of leak testing. Use of high pressures will
break through a scdium oxide film covering a small hole; it has heen
demonstrated that other methods such as a mass spectrometer in a
vacuum system will not detect that type of leak. Also, as discussed
below, a system leak in the pressure-decay method will give a positive
identification., The top weld of the element to be checked is sealed
with a seal gland into a chamber of approximately 0.06 cc in volume.

A metering chamber also 0.06 cc in volume is pressurized to 82 atmos-
pheres from a helium gas cylinder. The metering chamber is then opened
to the test chamber with the top end of the element sealed in it,
producing a resultant pressure of about 41 atmospheres in the two
chambers. If there is a leak in the weld, the gas is forced into the
gas plenum region of the fuel element and the pressure is reduced

to about 20 atmospheres. If a leak around the sealing gland exists,
the pressure in the chamber approaches zero. Each weld is pressurized
for 7 min, during the test. This duration in combination with the
readout equipment presently in service results in a sensitivity of
about 10-% cc/sec. The lower sensitivity of this leak test compared
to the one carried out on the tip-to-tube weld is acceptable, since
the consequences of a leak in the gas plenum are much less serious
than those of a leak near the bottom of the element during reactor
cperagtion,

Experience has shown that the capacitor-discharge welding technique
produces very few slow leaks at the closure weld. Either the weld is
good or the defect is large enough to allow high leak rates and rapid
depressurization of the leak-detector head.

Sodium Bonding

Following the completion of leak testing of the fuel-element
closure weld, a sodiuT bon?ing operation is the next fabrication
step for the element. 9:10) This operation is required in order to
establish a high-quality heat transfer path in the 0.006-in.-thick
sodium-filled annulus between the fuel pin and the jacket., The
establishment of such a path will allow for the effective removal of
heat from the figsioning fuel-pin material to its Jjacket and sub-
sequent removal by the EBR-II primary-sodium coolant.

The impact-bonding technique employed consists of heating groups
of 50 elements in a special magazine within an electrical resistance
furnace to a temperature of 500° ¢ (Fig. 4). When this temperature
is attained, a vertically oriented mechanical impact is delivered
similtaneously to the 50 fuel elements by means of a single-acting,
spring-return pneumatic cylinder coupled to a hardened steel striking
platen in the bonding machine. Bonding impacts are transmitted from
the pneumatic cylinder's striking platen to the elements through
hardened tool-steel transition pileces at a rate of approximately

100 impacts per minute. These impacts, usually 1000 in number in
any bonding sequence, cause the fuel elements to move vertically up-
ward in free flight for a distance of approximately 1 to 1 l/u in.
and return to their starting positions before the subsequent impact
ig initiated. Forces resulting from the impacts cause the gas
entrapments in the sodium thermal-bond annulus of the fuel element

to move upward out of the bond region and into the gas plenum at

the top end of the element, thus leaving the bond itself free of
gaseous defects. Defect removal is aided by high transient pressures
that apparently result in the sodium near the element lower end
during the impacting process and by small, but significant, move-
ment of the fuel pin with respect to its Jacket. This latter feature
aids the upward travel of gas bubbles by a mechanical "wiping" action,

Following completion of the impacting procedure, a carefully
controlled furnace cocl-down 1s carried cut for the elements in the
bonding machine, This cooling procedure ensures that the bond
sodium will reach the solid state (approximately 100° C) progressively
from the bottom ends of the elements toward their top ends. The
controlled cooling eliminates shrinkage voids, tears, etc,, which
will develop in the sodium if top-to-hottom or otherwise uncontrolled
rapid cooling is allcowed to take place.

Experience has indicated that when recycling the bond rejects and
using up tc three bonding sequences (three operations, each of which
utilizes 1000 impacts delivered while maintaining a temperature of
5000 C), a 91% acceptance rate has resulted (see Table II). The
operation does cause some deformation of the tip, but this does not
appear to be significant. Impacting the elements for more than three
sequences may cause excessive damage. A bonding sequence for 50
driver elements requires approximately 4 hrs.

Sodium Bond Tesgting

Following the completion of impact bonding, the same 50-element
magarine used in the bonding cperation ig positioned in the sodium
bond-testing machine (Fig, 5). This machine utilizes an encircling-
type coil coupled with a pulsed eddy-current system to indicate the
quality of the fuel-element sodium bond, the sodium level within the
element, the fuel-pin overall length, and other less important inter-
pretable features.(1l)

The mechanical portion of the machine incorporates a pneumatically
operated turntable which allows individual peositioning of the 50
elements contained in the magazine at the prcper test location. A
pneumatic cylinder raises each element from the magazine, upward
through the eddy-current coil tc a position where it is grasped by
an element drive mechanism, This drive mechanism raises the element
upward through the eddy-current coil for the element's entire length,

then reverses its movement to downward, and returns the element to
the magazine.

A strip-chart recorder is synchronized to the element drive system
so that a one-to-one ratio results in the test recording. This re-
cording provides duplicate indications of the element's sodium bon-
and sodium level; the first resulting from the upward travel of the
element through the encircling eddy-current coil, and the second
from its downward travel through the coil. Figure 6 presents a
typical eddy-current recording for an EBR-II driver element.

The pulsed eddy-current system of the machine with its integral
encircling coil is able to detect discontinuities (gas voids, tears,
etc.) as small as 0.015 in. in diameter in the sodium-bond annuli of
EBR-II driver elements. In addition, the system is capable of in-
dicating the level of the sodium column in the fuel element to an
accuracy of + 0.020 in. Sodium entrapment in the gas plenum regions,
and gas pockets in the sodium column above the fuel pins, are also
readily discernable.

Approximately 2 hrs. are required to bond test and level test a
magazine of 50 elements. Although the machine has an integral
electrical resistance furnace incorporated in its design for elevated-
temperature sodium-bond testing, all production bond testing of EBR-II
driver elements has been carried out at hot-cell temperatures, approxi-
mately 90 to 95° F, at which the sodium is in the solid state.

Preassgembly and Subagsembly Fabrication

A subassembly, as furnished to EBR-IT, is made of several paris
(Fig. 7). FExternally, it consists of a top-end fixture, a hexagonal
tube, and a lower adapter. The top-end fixture has a stem that is
used for all handling, both in FCF and in the reactor; the lower
adapter supports the subassembly in the reactor and contains the
orifice holes that maintain the deslired coolant flow.

The internal porticn of the subassembly has been changed three
times during the history of the reactor. Originally, the regions
above and below the fuel elements were depleted uranium blanket
sections. Each section contained 18 sodium-bonded depleted uranium
elements, two grids, and a tie bar. After approximately two years,
the breeding ratios for the reactor had been determined, and the
expensive blanket elements were replaced by solid stainless steel
rods. However, even this desigh contained relatively expensive grids
and required considersble assembly time, and was replaced by stain-
less steel shields. These shields are still in use at the present
time; each consists of two trifluted sections, offset 60° with a
connecting pin., They provide approximately the same pressure drop
as the blanket sections, and the offget reduces neutron streaming
to the reactor components above and below the subassemblies.

A1l of the components are manufactured from Type 304 stainless
steel. Acceptable components are fabricated into upper and lower pre-
assemblies. The upper preassembly consists of the top-end fixture,
the hex tube, and one shield. The lower preassembly consists of the
lower adapter, one shield, and the "T" bar grid. The latter is an
assembly of 11 T-shaped bars onto which the fuel elements are placed;
the bars are welded to a short hexagonal tube.

The refabricated fuel elements must be assembled into a sub-
assembly before they can be reinserted intc the reactor core. This
operation is performed on the assembly machine located in the FCF
air cell.

The assembly operation consists of placing a new upper and lower
preassembly in the assembly machine and performing the following
operations. The 91 refabricated elements are fitied on the lower
preassembly grid by using the master-slave manipulators. Each fuel
element has an identity and must be placed in its proper position
on the grid so that when the element is examined after irradiation,
the pre- and postexamination data can be compared. The upper pre-
assembly is then lowered over the 91 fuel elements and seated on the
lower preassembly. Six tungsten inert-gas spot welders are then
positioned at the lower end of the upper preassembly and six spot
welds are made, Jjoining the upper and lower preassemblies,

After the assermbly is completed, 1t must be tensile tested to
ensure sound welds. The tensile tester locks the upper and lower
adapters of the subassembly into fixtures and applies a tensile force
of 1800 1bs. The subassembly is then moved to the straightness
tester. The subassembly 1s again held in position by the upper and
lower adapters and the straightness of the six flat surfaces and
the lower adapter are checked with prepositioned dial indicators.

The maximum permissible bow is 0.040 in. If the subassembly passes
these inspections, it is returned to the reactor via a 20-ton lead-
shielded cask.

Summary

The remote fabrication process described in this paper represents
e noteworthy accomplishment from twe distinct viewpoints. The first
is the production accomplishments of the process and the second is
the ramifications of conducting a remote multistaged production
operation,

In the period September 1964 to April 1969, the facility produced
353 subassemblies, This represents more than 5 reactor-core loadings
of reprocessed and refabricated fuel. In accomplishing this, the
facility received LL5 subassemblies of spent fuel, refined 598k kg
of fuel, and cast 607k kg of fuel., It produced L4,080 castings, of
which 83.1% were of adequate quality to process. The jacketing,
welding, and leak-detection operations processed 39,750 units, of
which 96.6% were acceptable. The bonding and bond-testing operations
processed 38,337 elements, of which 34,976 or 91.2% were accepted as
reactor grade.

It is noteworthy that of the over 40,000 elements that have seen
reactor service, only one failed element has been detected. That one
element appeared to have been defected in the final assembly operaticn
(into a subassembly) and caused no serious difficulty during reactor
operation.

The second salient accomplishment of the Fuel Cycle Facility has
been the proof in operation of the basic assumptlons of the initlal
design. These, in broad perspective, were the capability to con-
tinuously operate a remote facility and to provide remotely operated
process equipment that could support a production type of effort,

The facilities used in these operations (air cell and argon cell)
were last entered by persomnnel in March 1964, Continuous multistage
facility operation without personnel entry for over five years is
unprecedented in remote systems technology.

A relatively high availability rate for manipulators and process
equipment is essential to the successful operation of any continuous
remote production activity. For the 35 units which make up the mani-
pulative capacity of the faeility, the availability has ranged

95
between 61 and 99%, with the average availability being 89%. The
21 units of process equipment have had operstional avallabilities
of between 80% and 99% with an average availability of 92.5%.

The experience garnered in the past five years in pyrometallurgical

procesging and remote fabrication has provided a strong experience

base for continued development of spent fuel processing that encompasses
integration of reactor and plant, fast turnaround (low inventory),
radioactive waste concentration, and remote fabrication,

Abstract

The Molten Salt Reactor Expe imen% gMBRE) has been refueled with
an enriching salt concentrate, LiF- UF), (73-27 mole %), vhich was
prepared in a shielded cell in the Thorium-Uranium Recgcle Facillty
at ORNL. The preparagﬁgn process involved reducing UO (
conten 222 p g by treatment with hydrogen, coaggrtlng
the U02 to UFh by hygrofluorination, and fusing the UF) with

The original MSRE fuel salt, which contained 220 kilograms of
235U-238U was fluorinated to volatilize the uranium as UFg. The
UFg was then absorbed on packed beds of NaF pellets. Essentially
all of the uranium was recovered in six runs; less than 5 grems was
lost to the caustic scrubber solution. To minimize corrosion, fluo-
rination was discontinued before the uranium volatilization was
complete (i.e., 130 grams of uranium wes allowed to remain in the
molten salt). The uranlgm was decontaminated from fission products
by a factor of almost 10 Fluorine utilization veried from greater
than 70% initially to 13% (average) for the final run, and averaged
39% for all six runs. Corrosion products were removed from the
barren carrier salt by reduction and filtration. Corrosion rates
for surfaces exposed to fluorine during fluorination averaged 0.1
mil/hour for 47 hours.

Intrecduction

The ORNL Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) is an 8-megawatt
circulating liquid fuel reactor operating at 1200°F. The original
fuel contalned gg mole % LiF, 30 mole % BeFp, 5 mole % ZrF), and
0.9 mole % The reactor first went critical on June 1,
1965, and began full-power operation in May 1966; prior to shutdown
on March 26, 1968, the reactcr had operated for slightly more than
one equivalent full-power year (or 72,400 megawatt hours).

This paper describes the work done in 1968 at ORNL in preparation
for the refuellng of the MSRE with an enriching salt concentrate,
TLiF-233UF), (73-27 mole %). This concentrate was prepared in the
Thorium=-Urenium Recycle Facility because the 233U used contained 222
ppm of 232y, The gamma emitting daughters of this 232U produced a
radiation level of 300 Rem/hour for a 450-gram can of the starting ox
ide and necessitated the use of heavy shielding and remote processing.

At the reactor plant, the uranium in the original MSRE fuel salt
was removed as UFg by fluorination. The barren fuel carrier salt
was purified by reduction and filtration.

Preparation of 7LiF-233UF)_,, Concentrate

Three batches of 233U'O (1) each containing 12 kilograms of 233U
were required as starting materlal for greparlng 63.4 kilograms of
the fuel-enriching concentrate, This congentrate was
to contain 39 kilograms of uranium (35.6 kilograms of <33U). The
first run began May 9, 1968, and the third run was completed July 30,
1968. The product was packaged in 45 enrichment capsules, four 7-
kilogram shipping containers, and a six-can cluster comprised of
shipping containers of miscellaneous sizes. The ten salt shipping
containers and the 45 enrichment capsules were delivered to the MSRE
as required in the reactor enrichment schedule.

Process Equipment

The flowsheet shown in Figure 1 1s a simplified presentatiocn of
the major eguipment components required in the process. These com-
ponents are: (1) the fuel decanning station, (2) the reaction or
oxide treatment vessel, (3) the salt storage and transfer vessel,
(4) various containers for shipping the product, (5) the off-gas
scrubbers.

In addition, the process requires many other smaller items of
equipment, such as: the oxide can preparation equipment, the in-cell
titration assembly, furnaces for the vessels, the enrichment capsule
drilling and weighing stetion, disconnect stations for electrical and
instrument lines and process gas lines, work tables, and tool racks.

The reduction and conversion processes were monitored by a thermo-
couple array that was inserted into the powder in the reaction ves-
sel and by measurements of hydrogen and HF utilization during the
reduction step and the conversion step, respectively. Unfiltered
and filtered samples of the melt were withdrawn for oxide, petrograph-
ic, and metal impurity analyses.

Feed Materials

The 233U0; had been prepared in batches by using 7 M NHjOH (in
excess) to precipitate hydrous uranium oxide from solutions that
contained 10 to 40 grams of uranium per liter and were 1 M in HNO
and NHhNO . The uranium in the feed solution had been purified aild
isolated gn 1964 and 1965 by a solvent extraction method, followed
by ion exchange. These treatments decreased the concentrations of
plutonium, thorium, fission products, and corrosion products {iron,
nickel, and chromium) to acceptably low levels.

The hydrous oxide had been dried and packaged in nested aluminum
cans. No spread of contamination or excessive radistion exposure to
personnel occurred during the removal of the cans from the storage
facility, during their transfer to TURF, or during their discharge
from the carrier to cell G.

Figure 2 shows the chemical flowsheet used for the fuel prepara-
tion work.

Reduction of 233Uo3

Three separate operations were required to elongate the cans of
233U'O3 to the 9-1/2-inch length required for proper operation of the
can opening box. These operations involved trueing the cans and ce-
menting a l-l/E-inch cap on the end of each. The elongated cans of
oxide were opened, one at a time, in the decanning station, and
dumped into the reaction vessel.

The bed of 233y0, that had been dumped into the reaction vessel
was expanded and thén heated for 2 hours at 550°C in a helium at-
mosphere to remove, by pyrolysis, any traces of ammonium compounds
or cther volatiles remaining from the chemical processing.

The oxide bed was then cooled to L400°C before reduction with
hydrogen was started. This temperature was sufficiently low to
accomodate the temperature rise that would be expected from the
exothermic reaction of hydrogen with UO3:

The concentration of hydrogen (in helium) was adjusted initially to

5 vol % and was graduslly increased to 50 vol % during the first k4
hours of treatment. The temperatures rose in response t¢o an increase
in hydrogen concentration and then became constant.

Both the location of the reaction zone and the zone movement inside
the 24-inch-high bed of 233U02 were clearly defined by the tempera-
ture profile. As the reaction progressed, the reaction zone rose,
in the form of a band, up through ‘the powder bed.

After the temperature excursions resulting from the increases in
hydrogen flow had subsided (approximately 12 hours), the temperature
of the furnace was increased, at the rate of 30°C/hour, until the
bed temperature was 525 & 25°C. The reduction operation was contin-
ued at this temperature, with 50 vol % hydrogen--50 vol % helium, at
e gas flow rate of 2 liters/minute, until 50 to 100% excess over the
stoichiometric amount of hydrogen had been passed through the bed.
Oversll reduction time was about 56 hours.

Hydrogen utilization within the bed was 100% until the reaction
zone approached the top of the powder bed; then a slight decrease
was observed. Hydrogen usage was determined by a material balance
of the gas outflow, as measured by the in-cell wet test meter.

Hydrofluorination of 233uo,

Upon completion of the oxide reducg§§n step, the bed was allowed
to cool to 4OO°C. The conversion of <33U0, to @ 33yF), by hydrofiue-
rinstion, using HF gas diluted with hydrogen, began at U400°C end was
completed at 625°C. A period of 5 to 7 days was required for the
conversion.

The HF gas that was supplied to the process was withdrawn from
the vapor space of a heated 100-pound HF cylinder. A differential-
pressure transmitter across & caplllary restrictor in the HF gas
supply line was used to monitor the flow. The gas was passed through
a maze of tightly packed nickel wire in a 2-inch-diameter nickel tube
thet was maintained at 625°C to remove sulfur from the stream. It
was then mixed with a metered amount of dry hydrogen, filtered, and
introduced to the reac%ion vessel through a dip tube that extended
to the bottom of the = UO bed.

At the beginning of the hydroflucrination step, the composition
of the gas used for hydrofluorination was 95 vol % hydrogen--5 vol %
HF; the flow rate of the mixture was 2 stenderd liters/minute. Over
a period of 3 to 4 hours, the HF concentration was incrementally in-
creased to 40 vol % as the exothermic reaction caused the bed tempera-
ture to rise from 400 to 450°C. During these initial hours, the

102
temperature within the bed was constantly monitored to determine
when the temperature excursion resulting from each HF flow adjustment
had ceased and when another adjustment could be made.

After the HF concentration of the hydrofluorinating mixture had
reached LO vol %, the reaction zone traveled, in the form of a band,
up through the bed {in a manner similar to that obsggved during the
hydrogen reducticn) as the 233U02 was converted to 3UFLL. The
reaction

U0y + 4HF —UF), + 2Hp0 + 144,000 cal/g-mole

is more exothermic than the reduction reaction, but it does not have
as great a tendency to cause thermal excursions. Probably, this is
the result of differences between UO3, UOo, and UFu with respect to
bed permeability and thermal properties. The reaction-zone tempera-
tures for the three production runs were plotted as a function of
time, as a control measure.

The progress of the hydrofluorination reaction was also followed
by obtaining a material balance of the HF in the system. The HF
utilization was essentially 100% for the first five days and then
decreased sharply as the reaction zone reached the top of the bed.
Then the temperature of the bed was increased to 625°C, where it was
held for two days to ensure completeness of the reaction. The HF
utilization did not increase at the higher temperature; instead, it
continued to decrease, suggesting that the reaction had been complete
at the end of the fifth day of hydrcflucrination.

A total of 13.5 kilograms of uranium, as 233yo , was converted to
233uF, in each of three runs; only very mincr differences in the runs
were noted.

Formation of the Eubtectic Salt

The eutectic mixture 233UF)-TLiF (27-73 mole %) was formed by
adding the stoichiometric quantity of lithium flucride powder to the
uranium tetrafluoride powder and fusing the mixture.

The temperature of the reaction vessel containing the stratified
233UFu and TriF powders was increased to 855°C in order to melt the
lithium fluoride (melting point, 835°C). The melt was digested at
this temperature for 3 hours while it was sparged with hydrogen (at
a flow rate of 0.2 liter/minute) to reduce any extraneous compounds
that might have been introduced duvring the LiF addition.

Differences, with regard to conditions durin§ initial meltdown,
were noted in the runs. In runs 1 and 3, the 2 3UFu and 233LiF had
to be heated to about 850°C before melting occurred. In run 2, ini-
tial melting cccurred at 650°C, nearly 200°C below the melting point
of the lithium fluoride. The low-temperature initisl melting must

103
have resulted from the presence of a sizable heel of salt (melting

point, 490°C) that remained in the reaction vessel from Tug %. Prob-

?bly, this heel acted as a "seed" to permit fusing of the 3 UF), and
1iF powders at the lower temperature.

The 9-inch-deep pool of eutectic salt (melting point, L90°C) was
treated with 20 vol % HF--80 vol % hydrogen (flow rate, 2.4 liters/
minute) for 24 hours at a temperature of T00°C to remove the last
traces ¢f oxide from the salt prior to the hydrogen purification pro-
cedure. At the conclusion of this treatment, an unfiltered sample
of the salt was withdrawn and analyzed for oxide content. (A 1/2-
inch-0D x 2-1/4-~inch-long nickel cup was immersed in the salt to
withdraw a 25-gram sample.) A l-inch-long section cut from the cen-
ter of the sample was analyzed petrographically and chemically for
the presence of UO,. The remaining portion of the sample was sub-
mitted for a compléte chemical analysis.

The more rapldly obtained petrographic results were used to
determine whether hydrofluorination should be resumed or whether
hydrogen purification of the melt should be continued. In each of
the three runs, the UQ, content was reported to be less than the
lower limit of accuracy (220 ppm) for the petrographic appraisal;
thus, subsequent HF treetment was unnecessary. Chemical analyses
of the same samples showed oxide contents (in the product salts) of
62, 34, and 32 ppm for runs 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

Purification of the Eutectic Salt

The eutectic salt was purified by bubbling pure hydrogen gas (3
to 10 ppm Eéo), at a flow rate of 2 standard liters/minute, through
the 10-inch-deep eutectic salt melt. The temperature of the molten
salt during this reaction,

MF + 1/2 H, — HF + M°,

was TO0°C. The progress of the reaction was followed by titrating
the effluent gas with the in-cell titration assembly. The end point
of the purification was evident from the leveling off of the HF evo-
lution rate at 0.025 milliequivalent per liter of hydrogen. The
hydrogen flow rate was increased on several occasions during the proc-
ess, and the reaction rate seemed to be almost independent of the
hydrogen concentration.

The chromium concentration in the melt was not affected by the
hydrogen treatment. The levels to which the iron (100 ppm) and
nickel (75 ppm) concentrations were decreased are believed to be near
the limit of accuracy of the sampling system and the laboratory
analyses.

During each of the three runs, the reaction vessel was exposed
for 20 days to 40 vol % HF--60 vol % hydrogen at temperatures ranging

104

from 40O to 850°C. Approximately 5 grams of nickel (from the nickel
liner of the reaction vessel) was lost to each melt. This corresponds
to a uniform corrosion rate of slightly less than 0.001 inch/year —

a low rate for this type of process.

Transfer of the Fuel Concentrate

Eight operations were necessary to transfer the three 13.5-
kilogram batches of eutectic salt mixture from the reaction vessel
to the intermediate transfer vessel and then to the various shipping
container assemblies. The transfers ranged in size from the 13.5
kilograms of uranium (4.7 liters of salt) in the production batches
to the 4.3 kilograms of uranium (1.5 liters of salt) that was re-
quired to fill the array of 45 enrichment capsules. The transfer
operations were conducted at a salt temperature of 600°C. (This
temperature had been arbitrarily selected, and the containers had
been fabricated to contain the desired quantity of fuel at this
temperature.)

Shipping Containers

The shipping containers were arranged in three arrays for the
filling operations. Iater, upon completion of the filling operation
and freezing of the salt, each array was disassembled into individual
containers (at TURF) for shipment to the MSRE.

The first array (Figure 3) consisted of 45 enrichment capsules,
each of which was 3/t inch in diameter and 6 inches long and designed
to contain 96 grams of uranium. The capsules were connected in series
and arranged in three 15-capsule decks.

The second array (Figure 4) consisted of four 2-1/2-inch-diameter
by 34-inch-long cans connected in series for filling operations.
Each was designed to contain 7 kilograms of uranium and had an in-
strumented overflow pot. They were shipped, one at a time, to the
MSRE, and charged to the drain tank. In this tank, the salt melts
and runs out of the container.

The third array (Figure 5) contained a group of six 2-1/2-inch-
diameter variable-length cans that were similar in design and arrange-
ment to those in the second array. One of these cans was used to
store excess product material that was blown back from the other five
cans after they had been filled to overflow. The latter cans were
designed to contain 0.5 to 3 kilograms of uranium (two cans, 0.5
kilogram each; one can, 1 kilogram; cne can, 2 kilograms; and one
can, 3 kilograms).

The MSRE Fuel Processing Operations

The MSRE Fuel Processing Facility(e) was constructed in s smgll
cell in the reactor building for two purposes: (&) to remove any
sccumulated oxides in the fuel or flush selt by H.-HF sparging, and
(b) to recover the original uranium charge from the fuel carrier
salt in order to allow the 233U fuel concentrate to be added for the
second phase of reactor operation. This facility had been operated
previously, in 1965, to remove 115 ppm of oxide from the flush salt
before the reactor went critical.

A LiF-BeF, (66~ 34 mole %) salt that had been used to flush the
reactor seven times was used for a final test of the uranium recovery
process. The uranium that had accumulated (6.5 kilograms) in this
salt was recovered without incident in less than 7 hours.

The recovery process consisted of fluorine sparging the salt to
volatilize the uranium, followed by decontamination of the gas stream
with a T50°F NaF bed and absorption of the UF6 on 200°F NaF. The
excess fluorine was removed by an aqueous scrubber. The corrosion
product flucrides were reduced to the metals, which were filtered
from the salt.

Using this process, approximately 216 kilograms of uranium was
recovered from the fuel salt batch in 46.5 hours. Corrosion of the
fuel processing tank during fluorination of the fuel salt averaged
about 0.1 mil/hour. Fluorine utilization averaged 7.7% during fluo-
rination of the flush salt and 39% during fluorination of the fuel
salt.

Reduction and filtration produced a carrier salt with less impu-
rities than the original salt. The recovered uranjum was decontami-
nated from fgssion products by factors of 8.6 x 10° (gross gamma)
and 1.2 x 107 (gross beta). Identifiable uranium losses were less
than 0.1%.

Description of the Process

Fluorination. — The flowsheet used in processing the flush salt
and the fuel salt is shown in Figure 6. The molten salt was forced,
under pressure, through a freeze valve in the drain tank cell, through
a metallic filter (backflow), and another freeze valve in the proec-
essing cell to the fuel storage tank. The transfer was maede at 1000
to 1100°F, a temperature that is well above the freezing point of the
salt but not hot enough to reduce the strength of the metallic filter
element below a safe limit.

After being cooled to 475°F, to minimize corrosion and fission
product volatilizaetion during fluorination, the salt was sparged with
pure fluorine or a fluorine-helium mixture at a relatively high flow

rate (approximately U0 liters/minute) to convert the UFu to UF..
When all the UF), had been converted to UF5, UF6 began to form gnd
volatilize, as indicated by a temperature rise in the first absorber.
When this occurred, the fluorine flow rate was reduced to 15 to 25
liters/minute to increase the absorber residence time and, in turm,
to permit more efficient absorption and to increase the fluorine
utilization.

The gas leaving the fuel storage tank was composed of UFg, excess
fluorine, helium, MoFg and some CrFg from corrosion, IF7, and other
fission product fluorides. It passed through a T50°F NaF trap, where
the chromium fluoride and most of the volatilized fission products,
except icdine and tellurium, were retained. After being routed
through the NaF trap, the gas stream, which now consisted of UFg,
fluorine, helium, MoFg, IF;, TeFg, and a trace of other fission
product fluorides, exited %rom the shielded cell and passed through
five NaF absorbers in-a sealed cubicle in the operating area. These
absorbers were heated to 200 to 250°F to increase the reaction rate
end to minimize MoFg absorption. As the UFg began to load on s
particular absorber and the temperature started to rise, cooling air
was supplied to the absorber to limit its temperature to a maximum
of 350°F. High temperatures tended to decrease the uranium loading
by promoting surface absorption and reducing the penetration of the
UFg to the inside of the pellets. The finasl absorber was operated
below 250°F, where the partial pressure of UFg over the UFg 2NaF
complex would allow only & negligible amount of uranium to reach the
caustic scrubber. The caustic scrubber was charged with 1300 liters
of 2 M KOH--0.33 M KI, along with 0.2 M KyB; 07, which was added as
a soluble neutren poison. The reaction occurring in the scrubber
was:

6F, + 12KOH + KI — 12KF + 6H,0 + 3/2 O, + KIOq

The scrubber sclution was replaced with fresh solution before one-
half of the KOH had been consumed, as determined by fluorine flow
and calculated utilization. (Dip tube corrosion increased when the
OH™ concentration was less than 1 M.) ILaboratory development of the
fluorine disposal system is described in reference (3). In addition
to fluorine, most of the molybdenum and iodine were removed in the
scrubber.

A high-surface-ares filter located downstream of the scrubber
removed any particulate matter that was retained by the scrubber.
During test runs, hydrated oxides of molybdenum collected at sharp
bends in the line from the scrubber. A soda lime trap (a mixture of
sodium and caleium hydrates) provided a detector for fluorine and a
means for removing traces of fluorine from the scrubber off-gas be-
fore it reached the charcoal sbsorbers.

Activated impregnated charcoal traps sorbed any iodine not re-

moved in the caustic scrubber. The gas exiting from the charcoal
traps contained only helium and oxygen (that was produced in the

il1l
caustic scrubber). This gas flowed through an absolute filter and
wes monitored for gamms activity and for iodine before being mixed
with the remainder of the building exhaust gas, which passed through
additional filters and was finally discharged from s 100-foot-tall
stack.

When there was no longer any evidence cf absorber heating, the
flow of fluorine was discontinued, and the salt was sampled and
analyzed. The uranium concentration in the salt was expected to be
less than 50 ppm at this time.

Reduction. — Before the fuel carrier salt could be returned to
the reactor system, the NiF,, FeF,,and CrF (produced by corrosion
of the Hastelloy-N fuel storage tank) had %o be removed from it (MbF6
is volatile). Because of the high concentration of nickel in
Hastelloy-N, the NiF, concentration in the salt was also high. Since
nickel is more noble than iron or chromium, it is reduced by hydrogen
sparging at 1225°F. After the NiF, was reduced, as indicated by fil-
tered salt samples, pressed zirconium metal shavings were added to
the salt, and hydrogen sparging was continued to reduce the FeF2 and
CrF2 to the metal form. The metals subsequently formed were then
removed by a fibrous metal -filter, and the efficiency of the filtra-
tion was verified by sampling of the filtered salt.

Description of the Equipment

Plant Layout. — Most of the processing equipment is located in s
13 x 13 x 17-foot-deep cell (Figure 7) located adjacent to the reactor
drain tank cell. This cell contains the fuel storage tank (fluorin-
ator), the 750°F sodium fluoride trap, the caustic scrubber, two
remotely-operated air valves, and three salt freeze-valves.

An adjacent cell of the same size contgins the off-gas equipment--
the mist filter, the soda-lime trap, charcoal traps, and the off-gas
filter--that is located downstream of the caustic scrubber.

The plant is operated from the high-bay area over the two cells
Jjust described. This area contains the absorber cubicle, the in-
strument cubiecle, the instrument panelboard, the sampler and sampler
panelboard, hydrogen and oxygen monitors, and radiation detection
instruments.

The gas supply station is situated outside the building. The
fluorine manifold (where two 15,000-1iter fluorine tanks mounted on
trailers can be connected), the hydrogen manifold, and the pressure
and fiow instrumentation associated with these two gases are also
located here. The helium for purging and sparging comes from the
reactor system supply.

Fuel Storage Tank. — The fuel storage tank, or fluorinator, is a
50-inch-diameter, 10-foot-tall Hastelloy-N tank with sbout 30% free-
board to minimize salt carryover during gas sparging. There is nc
provision for cooling since the heat loss will limit the temperature
to less than 1200°F after a two-week decay period. During the UF)
to UFc conversion period, when the fluorine utilization is high, the
heat of reacticn and the afterheat maintain the temperature of the
salt at 850°F. About 12 kilowatts of electrical heat is required
during the reduction operation at 1225°F. The gas inlet line has a
normsl submergence of 6L inches, and the differential pressure be-
tween this line and the gas space provides an indication of liquid
level in addition to that indicated by weigh cells. The tank is also
equipped with an ultrasegnic probe tc verify the weigh cell calibra-
tion during the filling and emptying operations.

NaF Trap. — The NaF trap is a 20-inch-diameter by 18-inch-high
Inconel vessel that is operated at 750°F. At this temperature,
volatile ruthenium, niobium, antimony, and chromium fluorides are
absorbed, and uranium and molybdenum hexafluorides pass through.

This trap was designed to be replaceable because of 1ts suscepti-
bility to becoming plugged with volatilized chromium fluorides.
Rather extensive chromium fluoride volatilization was expected during
the processing of the fuel salt as the uranium concentration in the
salt decreased; however, no pressure drop was detected.

Caustic Scrubber. — The caustic scrubber, which is used for
disposing of excess fluorine and of the HF produced during NiF, re-
duction, is a 42-inch-dismeter by 84-inch-high Inconel tank with two
dip lines, each with 3-3/8-inch holes. The dip lines have shutoff
valves with extension handles for alternating dip lines when plug-
ging occurs. This plugging, which is caused by the buildup of
corrosion products in the dip line, can be eliminated in 5 or 10
minutes after use of the plugged line has been discontinued.

UFg Absorbers. — Five absorbers, piped in series, are located in
a sealed cubicle in the operating area situated above the processing
cell. The absorbers, 14 inches in diameter and 12 inches high, are
made of carbon steel. When loaded to within 1/2 inch of the top,
each absorber holds about 25 kilograms of NaF. Bach absorber is
mounted in an insulated can and provided with an air cooling coil
and an electric heater.

Salt Filter. — The salt filter(h) consists of two 4-foot-long
concentric fibrous metal cylinders with & total filter area of 8.65
square feet. During the filtration of flush and fuel salts, there
was no detectable pressure drop across the filter even when salts
conteining sbout 10 kilograms of reduced corrosion products were
filtered. It i1s not known how much of these metals remained behind
in the fuel storage tank. Filtration of each of the two batches
required about 2 hours.

Processing Results

Recovery of Uranium. — The amount of urenium that was recovered
has been determined from the weight increase of the absorbers. Some
MoF¢g, which was also absorbed, had to be subtracted in order to ob-
tain an accurate value. Although the total emount of absorbed molyb-
denum is not sccurately known, random samples showed a correlation
between the percentage of molybdenum on the NaF and the amount of UFg
that passed through the NaF. However, such a correlation provides
only an approximate value for the absorbed McFg because other factors,
such as flow rate, temperature, and type of NaF, also affect the MoFg
loading.

Based on the correlation, a total of 1600 grams of molybdenum was
absorbed. Subtracting this wvalue from the increase in absorber
welght yields a uranium recovery of 216.0 kilogrems. This value is
in good agreement with the amount (218.0 kilograms) which was calcu-
lated to be present from the uranium charged to the reactor, the
burnup, and the number of samples removed, etc. Since 0.13 kilogram
of uranium remained in the salt when fluorination was discontinued,
and since less than 1 gram of uranium was found in the scrubber solu-
tions, 1.87 kilogreams, or 0.85% of the totel uranium, is unaccounted
for.

Purity of the Uranium Product. — The NaF at the inlet of the first
absorber in each run was analyzed for beta and gamma emitters about
12 days after fluorination. Analyses of feed salt samﬁ%es showed
2.66 x 1013 gross gamme counts per minute and 3.8 x 10+3 gross beta
counts per minute per gram of uranium, respectively. The average
gross beta and gamma decontamination factors (DF's) for the six ab-
sorbers analgzed (corrected for uranium daughters) were 1.2 x 10
and 8.6 x 109, respectively. Only the gamma radiocactivity levels in
the first and second (of a totel of six) runs were appreciably above
background.

The only radioactive material collected in any measurable amount
on the NaF absorbers with the UFg was INb. Most of this material
was probably carried from the salt into the piping and equipment
located between the fuel storage tank and the metallic filter up-
stream of the absorbers at the end of the salt transfer operation
when the pressure of the transfer gas was released. Because of this
deposition of material, the calculated decontamination factor for
95 dpm per gram of U in salt .

¢ o per gram of U on absorber) is low. The calculated IF was
lower at the start of run 1 when most of the niobium between the NaF
trap and the absorbers was fluorinated and collected on the first
absorber. The calculated DF's wvaried from 5 x 10“ at the start to
1 x 1010 at the end of fluorination. Therefore, notwithstanding the
piping contamination, a considerably highe§ niobium IF was obtained
in these studies than was obtained (5 x 10 ) in the CORNL Volatility
Pilot Plant work using 30-day-decayed uranium.

115
Fluorine Utilization. — The efflciency of the fluorination reaction
is measured by the percentage of fluorine (after the fluorine that
is consumed by corrcsion is subtracted) that reacts with the uranium
in the salt. Fluorine utilization is a function of melt temperature,
fluorine flow rate, uranium concentretion, and dip tube submergence.
Laboratory tests had shown a decrease in fluorine utilization from
8.0% to 3.8% as the temperature was reduced from 930°F to 8LO°F.
Fluerine utilizations are shown in Teble I. The higher utilization
(average, 39%) during the fuel salt processing was probably due
both to lower gas velocities and grester dip tube submergence than
were used in the laboratory tests. Utilizetion was very high before
the start of UFg volatilization (averasge, 71%) and then seemed to
become relatively insensitive to uranium concentration until nearly
all the uranium was volatilized.

Until 90 minutes before the start of UFg volatilization, the
readings on the absorber inlet snd outlet mass flowmeters were the
same, indicating the absence of any absorbable constituents in the
gas stream. These reading were used to calculate the fluorine utili-
zation. The utilization decreased when the fluorine flow rate was
increased and also when MoFg and UF began to be vaporized. It was
assumed that, 1f the fluorine flow rate is steady, the fluorine utili-
zation does not change until volatilization of some component hegins.
During the MoFg volatilization perilod (before UF6 was volatilized),
the fluorine utilization was calculated by difference, using data
obtained in the two previous periods and assuming that all the UFy
was converted to UFg before the volatilization of UFg began. During
the volatilization of UFg, the utilization was calculated from the
increase in absorber weights. The inlet mass flowmeter indicated a
high utilization toward the end of each run because of the accumula-
tion of UFg in the fuel-storage-tank gas space. This caused e higher
UFg concentretion in the exit gas stream near the end of the run.

Corrosion. — Corrosion of the Hastelloy-¥ fuel storage tank durlng
fluorination was one of the major difficulties encountered during
the processing of the flush and fuel salts. Tests of Hastelloy-N
coupons in the Volatility Pilot Plant and at Battelle Memorial Insti-
tute hed shown this alloy to be superior to nickel (mainly because
of the absence of intergranualr corrosion) and to be as resistant
as any other material tested. The corrosion rate, calculated from
the increase in chromium, iron, and nickel contents of the salt and
from the amount of MoFg volatilized, averaged 0.1 mil/hour for the
total fluorination period (i.e., 47 hours).

FPission Product Behavior. — The principal fission preducts that
form volatile fluorides are iodine, tellurium, molybdenum, ruthenium,
entimony, and niobium. Jodine volatilizes as IF- and passes through
the two NaF beds; it is removed by the caustic sZrubber both by
reaction with KOH and by exchange with KI. At the start of proces-
sing, we calculated that 404 me of I should be present in the fuel
salt. Actual analysis of the caustic serubber sclutions showed that

116
ruthenium and molybdenum are formed directly by fission, and radio-
active antimony has no long-lived precursors, the amounts of these
isctopes in the processed salt a§§ small as compared with nicbium,
which grows in from nonvolatile Zr. No ruthenium or antimony was
detected on the uranium absorbers or in the scrubber solutions.

Based on the lack of heat generation in the NaF' trap, we believe that
the volatilized nlﬁbium constltuted less than 10% of the total amount
of niobium (9 x 10™ curies) which would have grown in after reactor
shutdown. Most of the niobium apparently was removed from the salt
by deposition in the drein tank or in backflowing through the salt
filter during salt transfer. At the end of this transfer operation,
the transfer gas blowthrough carried a small smount of metallic nio-
bium to the absorber filter. Although this filter was decontaminated
prior to fluorination, some of the niobium deposited on it was un-
doubtedly carried to the upstream plping. During fluorination, this
niobium would be converted to volatile NbF: and would collect on the
UFg absorbers (any niobium upstream of the NeF trap should be gbsorbed
on the trap).

Two days after the end of the fluorination operation (i.e., at the
start of hydrogen reduction), a larger smount of niobium, estimsted
to be 10 to 15 curies, was found on the absorber filter. Since J7Nb
should have grown in at the rate of approximately 1000 curies per
day, it is apparent that less than l% of the niobium in the salt was
carried to the absorber cubicle. 5 only definite peak in a gamms
scan mede of the filter was that of 5l\Tb at 0.77 Mev.

Urenium Absorption. — Two types of NaF were used to absorb the
volatilized UFg: & high-surface-sres (HSA) material (1 m 2 /grem)
prepared by heating NeHF, pellets, and a low-surface-area (ISA)
material (0.063 m /gram) prepared from NeF powder and water, and
subsequently sintered at TO0°C. The ISA material wes originally
epecified for the plant because of its higher capacity for both CrF5
(on the T50°F NaF trap) and UFg. This higher cspacity results from
the slower surface reaction and the greater penetration to the inside
of the ILSA pellets. The low MoFg retention shown during preopera-
tional tests suggested that the reaction rate with UFg might be too
slow for complete uranium absorption Yn%er the planned operation con-
ditions. Subsequent laborstory tests confirmed the much slower
reaction rate of UF, with the ISA material. The absorbers were,
therefore, heated to increase the reaction rate, and the LSA NaF was
restricted to the No. 1 end No. 2 positions of the group of five
absorbers.

A comparison of the two types of NaF is shown in Figure 8. Three
ebsorbers loaded with each type of material were used in the first
pogition, and three of each type in the second position, during six
runs. In the first position, the NaF was exposed to a higher UFg
concentration, which resulted in a lower loading than in the second
position where the slower reection rate with the lower UFg concen-
tretion permitted deeper penetraticn of the pellets. Except in one

288 me and 10 mc were collected during run 1 and run 2, respectively.
This analysis provided a reasonable check on the icdine accountabil-
ity in the fuel salt during reactor operation. However, the amount
actually found was always less than tgglcalculated amount because

of the loss of the iodine precursocr, Te, before decay. There was
no indication that iodine deposited on the charcoal beds downstream
of the scrubber.

Tellurium exists primarily in the metallic state during reactor
operation and is essentially removed from the fuel salt in this form
by deposition and carryover to the off-gas streem; results of analy-
ses showed that less than 1% remained in the salt. This residual
tellurium would be converted to volatile TeFg during fluorination.
Tellurium hexafluoride is not absorbed on NaF at any temperature,
and is not removed in the caustic scrubber very efficlently. How-
ever, since analysis indicated that the scrubber solutions contained
no tellurium (i.e., the tellurium content was below the limit of
detection), it is probesble that the fuel salt did contain less than
1% of the tellurium at reactor shutdown. Any tellurium passing
through the scrubber would have been removed by the activated aluming
in the soda lime trep.

Molybdenum, ruthenium, niobium, and anbtimony also exist as metals

during reector coperation, and as such, are continuously removed by
deposition or by carryover to the off-gas stream. Since radioactive

In spite of the fact that the ILSA absorbers were operated at
higher temperatures {to compensate for the slower reaction rate),
the total loading was 13 to 14% higher than with the HSA material.

Abstract

The molten salt breeder reactor concept being developed at ORNL
requires continuous chemical processing of the fuel salt, which 1is
7TLiF-BeFp-ThF, (72-16-12 mole %) containing about 0.3 mole %
233yF,. 1In order to minimize fuel inventory, the reactor and the
processing plant are planned as an integral system. The main
functions of the processing plant are to isolate the 233Pa (which
is an intermediate in the production of 233y from 232Th) from the
neutron flux and to remove the rare earth fission products, which
constitute the major class of neutron poisons that are soluble in
the salt. (The noble gases and noble metal fission products are
not soluble in the salt.) The processing method being evaluated
involves the selective chemical reduction of the various compo-
nents into liquid bismuth solutions at about 600°C, utilizing
multistage countercurrent extraction operations. Protactinium,
which is easily separated from uranium, and from thorium and the
rare earths, would be trapped in the salt phase in a storage tamk
located between two extraction contactors and allowed to decay to
233y, Fluorination of the 233U from the salt entering this tank
would be used as a process control method. Rare earths would be
separated from thorium by a similar reductive extraction method;
however, this operation will not be as simple as the protactinium
isolation because the rare-earth-thorium separation factors are
only 1.3 to 3.5. The proposed process employs electrolytic cells

to simultanecusly generate reductant to the bismuth phase at the
cathode and to return extracted materials to the salt phase at the
anode. The practicability of the reductive extraction process
depends on the successful development of salt-metal contactors,
the electrolytic cells, and a suitable material of construction.

Abstract

A summary of the experiments carried ocut at Atomics Internaticnal
on pyrochemical reprocessing of uranium carbide fuel is described,
Three processes were investigated; 1) the CARBOX process which is
based on oxidation-carbothermic reductions 2) a nitride-carbide
¢ycle in which UC is converted to a nitride and then reconverted to
the carbide; and 3) a fused-salt electrolysis process in which UC is
anodized in a KC1-LiCl salt bath and the uranium cathode deposit is
dissolved in mercury and converted to UC by reaction with propane at
350 to 600°C,

Decontamination by all three processes was studied with lightly
irradiated UC (nvt ~J017). The CARBOX and nitride processes remove
about 75 per cent of the fission products, but plutonium losses are
high. The electrolysis process removes most (98-99.9 per cent)
fission products except zirconium. A 100 gram Scale oxidation exper-
iment was carried out using UC irradiated to 15,000 Mwd/MTU, Batches
of unirradiated UC up to 10kg were processed in scale up studies
using a rotary kiln., Oxidative decladding studies were carried out
in an apparatus capable of decladding 3 foot lengths of stainless
gteel clad fuel.

Cost studies indicate a savings of about 0,2 mil/kwh over aqueous
reprocessing for a 1000-Mwe scdium cooled power reactor using a burn-
up of 20,000 Mwd/MTU,

Introduction

A program was carried cut at Atomics Intermational to investigate
the potential of pyrochemical reprocessing to help achieve lower fuel
cycle costs for uranium carbide fuels.

It was hoped that a simpler method than the agueous process
developed for the recovery of weapons-grade fissile material would
beéfeasib e. With agqueous reprocessing, decontamination factors of
10~ to 10 were achieved and refabrication of low burnup fuels was
carried out by direct methods. The build-up of heavy isotopes in high
burnup recycled fuel will produce sufficient radiation even with com-
plete decontam%n§tion to require special methods of handling during
refabrication, 1 T%}s requirement suggests the consideration of
8impler processes(z’ which do not completely decontaminate the fuel,

Three processes were emphasized in the present work;(q) 1) oxida-
tion of the carbide to the oxide and then reduction with carboen to
the carbide (CARBOX); 2) conversion to the nitride with nitrogen and
reconversion to the carbide by heating in vacuum; and 3) molten salt
electrolysis.

Oxidation Carbothermic Reduction (CARBOX)

The first step in the CARBCX process(u) (CARBothermic-reduction
OXidation) is decladding of the fuel by oxidation., The resulting U0,
is then oxidized to Uj0g, re-enriched by addition and reduced with
carbon in a two step Process tc UC, The reactions involved can be
represented by:

Decladding

A serieg of experiments was carried out to determine the feasi-
bility o{ adapting the oxidative decladding method developed for U0,
fuels., In this method the cladding is punctured at 1 ineh inter-
vals along its length and exposed to air at ~400°C or steam at ~120°C,
The UC reacts to form U02, which results in about a 30 per cent
increase in volume, causing the cladding to split and the resultant

124

finely divided UO2 to fall out of the cladding. Typical specimens
are illustrated in Figure 1,

An apparatus was constructed which was capable of decladding three
foot lengths., In one experiment 750 grams of UC clad in 0.723 inch
OD-stainless steel, 0,010 inch wall thickness was punctured at one
inch intervals and heated at #400°C in air, The rod was completely
declad in 12 hours.

In similar experiments using sodium bonded UC, the cladding was
pierced and heated in vacuum to 600°C for three hours. The sodium
was effectively removed and the exposed fuel was oxidized by steam
at 120°C, Experiments using UC ifg§diated to 15,000 Mwd/MTU indicated
the applicability of the process, An obvious modification is to
chop the elements intc short lengths followed by exposure to oxygen
or steam,

Oxidation of UC

A series of small scale experiments was fergied out to study the
oxidation of UC with oxygen, CO, and steam.''’ It was found that
the oxidation rate, and also the rate of reaction with nitrogen, was
highly dependent upon the previous history of the UC. Uranium carbide
which has been recently melted oxidized very slowly below about 600°C
while aged (reactive) UC ignited in oxygen at about 300°C. It was
shown that freshly arc melted UC was converted to the reactive form
by exposing the moist air for a few days., Large slugs of hypostiochio-
metric UC were more difficult to activate.

The examination of both forms of UC showed no difference in photo-
micrographs, x-ray diffraction patterns, and chemical analysis for
uranium, carbon, and oxygen., There was some increase in hydrogen on
aging but this was in the several ppm range. The only physical
difference noted was a large increase in surface area (as measured
by B.E.T.) on activation. In a typical sample the surface area
increased from a few cm</g to 219 cm®/g on activation.

Oxidation experiments were carried cut with irradiated UC to (6)
determine if it would behave similarly to the unirradiated material.
In one experiment UC irradiated to 15,000 Mwd/MTU was used. The
material was reactive. It was oxidized for one hour at 310°C, then
heated to 600°C and reduced with forming gas (85 per cent N,, 15 per
cent Hy). There was a peak of radicactivity in the effluen% gas when
the temperature reached 500°C, The oxide was maintained at 600°C in
a reducing atmosphere for 2,3 hours. The results of this experiment
are shown in Table 1,

The rate then decreased and heat was required to complete the reaction,
The time of completion varied from 15 to 60 minutes.

A simalar series of e%gﬁrlments was carried out to study the
reaction of UC waith COQ. The reaction 1s initiated at about 350°C
and 1gnition occurs at about 525°C, Below about 670°C the reaction

A series of experlment? yas carried out to invesatigate scale up
of the oxadation process, 9 These experiments were carried cut i1n
a rotary kiln 16 inches in diameter by 21 inches long made of stain-
less steel. It was rotated at 8 to 10 rpm. The kiln was heated
electrically by movable clamshells. Reaction rates were controlled
by controlling the temperature and flow of air. Several kilogram
batches of are cast UC slugs were oxidized at a rate of 2 to E%kg
per hour. The results of some of these experiments are shown in
Table 2., As expected, unreactive material was difficult to oxadize,
Some batches were converted tec the reactive form by exposure to azr
at room temperature and oxidized readily.

Carbothermic Reduction

A series of smal sgale experiments was carried out to study the
reconversion to UC. 10 Two methods were investigated. In the first

127
method the oxidized product, primgrily U 0gy was reduced with hydro-
gen to UO,. The U0, was then reacted with carbon to product UC. 1In
the second method the U308 was reacted directly with carbon,

*The UC was only partially activated so wae treated in the kiln for
further activation; results are a total ¢f three oxidation treat-
ments,

Experiments with UOZ utilized powdered mixtures of UO2 and graphite.

In some experiments tThe mixture was pelletized using methyl methacry-
late or stearic acid as a binder. The mixture was outgassed below
1200°C and then heated above 1%00°C. The reaction rates followed the
gecond order equation

where x is the fraction reacted in time (%) and k is the rate con-
gtant., The rate constants followed the equation

10gk = 9.8 - ‘:'!'-6_,%0_0

where T is the temperature (°K).
It was found that in the experiments using pelletized mixtures
some carbon was contributed by the binder and a correction was

applied to the amount of carbon added.

Early attempts to prepare UC directly from U308 according to the
equation

128
U308 +11C — 3UC +8cot

resulted in a high and variasble carbon content.(lo) This was attri-
buted to the fact that beth CO and 002 were produced and that the
amounts depended on many variables, It was found that by carrying
out the reduction in two steps the stoichiometry could be controlled.
The reactions are represented by the following equations:

U

t

The temperature was maintained below 900°C until the first reaction
wag completed, The temperature was then raised to above 1300°C,
Reaction rates were more rapid than observed for UQO, as the starting
material, A}so the reaction rates were correlated by a 3/2 order rate
equation.(ll

Several scale up experiments were carried out to study the reaction
of U 08 with UC. In these experiments the charge was ball milled,
mixea with 1,15 wt per cent polyvinyl alcohel as a binder, and
agglomerated. The mixture was then heated in an induction wvacuum
furnace, These experiments were directed primarily toward the pre-
paration of hypostoichiometric UC. The results are shown in Table

In anither series of experiments three mixtures of irradiated UO
(nvt ~20 7) and carbon were prepared which would pr?duse hypostoichio-
metric, stoichiometric, and hyperstoichiometrie UC. Y These

In another experiment U0, was mixed with oxides of cerium, samarium
and neodymium and reduced with carbon. With a mixture which produced
hypostiochiometric UC, essentially all rare earths were removed at
1800°C, With a hyperstoichiometric mixture 75 per cent of the samar-
ium was removed below 1600°C, Heating to 1800°C removed essentially
all the samarium, 20 per cent of the neodymium, and 15 per cent of
the cerium,

Calculations on the effect of scale up indicate that plutonium
losses would not he serious on production scale carbothermic reduc-
tion, but that the losses during arc-melting would be prohibitive.,
The most promising refabrication method would seem to be pressing and

Comparative Costs

A study was carried out to compare fuel c¢ycle cg§ts for reprocess-
ing by CARBCX with a conventional aqueous plant.(l Fuel cyele costs
were computed for fuel recycled through a 360-Mwe sodium cooled power
reactor., Calculations were carried out through nine cycles of 20,000
Mwd/MIU with reprocessing and re-enrichment between each cycle, Fuel
reactivity was adjusted by the addition of an amount of enriched
uranium so that the reactivity of the fuel at discharge was constant
for each irradiation cycle, Burnup and re—ensichment requirements
were made using the computer code AIMFIRE.(15 The results of these
calculations are shown in Table 5.

The recycle of neutron absorbing fission products in fuels repro-
cessed by the CARBOX process increases the consumption of fissile
material but comparative fuel cycle costs indicate the burnup penalty
is less expensive than the savings realized via the simpler fuel
cycle., The costs are shown in Table 6.

The CARBOX reprccessed fuel requires remote fabrication, but since
high burnup fuels will contain isotopic impurities of the fertile and
fissile materials, direct fabrication may not be feasible even with
completely decontaminsted fuel, Fabrication costs and reprocessing
costs were combined for the CARBCX process. The potential savings
of ~0.2 mill/kwh represents a savings of $3.5 million/yr for a 1000-
Mwe installation.

The UC can then be refabricated by arc casting or pressing and sinter-

ing.

Conversion to the Nitride

Preliminary experiments were carried out using a thermobalance to

+4C ——> 4UC +3N 1

study the rate of reaction of UC with nitrogen.

The reaction rate of UC with nitrogen, as previously described
for oxidation, was found to be highly dependent on the previous

treatment of the carbide.

Arc melted UC (even -16 +30 mesh) which has been recently prepared
was unreactive to nitrogen at 800°C,

After about 40 days exposure

to laboratory air the UC became reactive. As with many solid-gas

132
reactions the mechanism appeared to be quite complex.(ls) A large
number of experiments were carried out in which nitrogen was reacted
with UC in a thermcbalance. The reaction rates were correlated by

= K(1-x) 7/

where K, t, and x are rate constant, time and fraction reacted.

The rate of reaction varied with time after arc melting, initial
particle size, UC composition, nitrogen pressure, and temperature,
The maximum rate occurs in the range of 900°C. The reaction goes
virtually to completion in a few hours and the product is a finely
divided powder which consists of a mixture of U2N3 and carbon.,

Reconversion to the Carbide

The reconversion,pf, the nitride to th. carbide appears to take
place in two stebs.( ) The first step w. ich converts the U’2N3 to UN

T
2UéN3 —> 4N +17,

occurs at a linear rate,
The second step in which the UN is converted to the carbide

2UN +2C ——> 2UC +N27

follows a parabolic rate,

Removal of nitrogen depends on temperature and carbon content.(lg)
If the material contains less than 4.8 wt per cent carbon (hypo-
stoichiometrie) sufficient nitrogen is retained to combine with the
excess uranium. If the material contains 4.8 wt per cent or more
carbon, the nitrogen can be reduced to a few hundred ppm at 1900°C,
Arc melting usually reduced the nitrogen content somewhat and samples
exposed to laboratory air lost carbon, presumably caused by the
reaction with oxygen.

Figssion Product Behavior

Experiments were carried out on the gram scale using lightly
irradiated UC (nxt‘:'lol7) to study the behavior of fission products.
No fission product removal was found after the conversion to the
nitride, although undoubtedly scme rare gases were released, The
material was then converted to the carbide, The results are shov
in Table 7.

Unless a way can be found to lower plutonium losses, arc melting
would not be a satisfactory method for refabrication.

Molten Salt Electrolysis

A method for reprocessing uranium carbide based on molten salt
electrolysis has been studied by Hansgen. This process is shown
schematically in Figure 2, It consists of three steps; 1) electroly-
8is, Uranium carbide is dissolved at the anode and uranium metal is
formed a8 a dendritic mass at the carhode; 2) dissolution in mercury.
The cathode deposit is immersed in hot mercury. The uranium readily
reacts to form a quasi-amalgam which separates from the occluded salt

atmosphere of propane. The uranium reacts readily to form stoichio-
metric UC and the mercury is distilled away.

Although in theory any alkali or alkaline earth halide can be
used in the molten salt bath, the KC1-LiCl eutectic was chosen
because of its low melting point, 352°C which is below the boiling
point of mercury. The occluded salt readily melts when the cathode
is immersed in hot mercury and can be conveniently separated.

In the experiments, the bath was prepared by adding approximately
10 per cent of either UCl; or UF) to the KC1l-LiCl eutectic and
purified by bubbling chlorine through the molten mixture. The anode
consisted of wafers cut from cast UC and supported by a molybdenum
wire or contained in a graphite crucible immersed in the bath. The
UC dissolved while the graphite remained inert. The reaction can be
represented as

e ——> U 4C 436"

The uranium metal was deposited on a molybdenum cathode as a
dentritic mass which contained appreciable quantities of occluded
Balts, After a few preliminary runs, current efficiencies of from
50 to 60 per cent were obtained,

The uranium deposit was immersed in mercury which was at a higher
temperature than the melting point of the occluded salt. The salt
melted and the freshly deposited uranium rapidly dissolved in the
mercury., The amalgam was cooled and poured through a cone filter
with a small hole in the bottom. The amalgam passed through the
hole and the frozen salt remained behind,

The salt free amalgam was heated to 350°C and contacted with a
hydrocarbon gas such as propane, The reaction is

3U(Hg) +%H8 —_— ZUC +Hg +4H27

The mercury was then distilled away leaving stoichiocmetric UC as
indicated by x-ray analysis, No detectable mercury remained,.

In an experiment carried out to determine fission_product behavior
during electrolysis, ten grams of irradiated UC (10~ nvt) was mixed
with 90g of unirradiated UC to form the anode material. Six deposits
were collected and each depeosit was dissolved in mercury and con-
verted to carbide by distillation in a propane atmosphere., The
results of this experiment are shown in Table 9. These results show
that appreciable decontamination from most of the fission products
can be achieved but remote refabrication would be required, The effect
of the remaining fission products on nuclear reactivity should be neg-
ligible. The behavior of plutonium was not determined due to diffi-
culties with analysis,

In an attempt to eliminate the dissolution step a series of
experiments was carried out to, determine the feasibility of using
a molten metal as the cathode.(go) The uranium dissclved in the
molten metal a8 it was electrolyzed. Two reguirements of the metal
are that it have a low melting point and be compatible with the
LiC1-KC1-UCl» salt bath. Lead, zinc, bismuth, and cadmium were used
as cathodes.” Because of potential problems with vaporization, mer-
cury was not used, The metal cathode was stirred with a tantalum
rod, and the salt bath was agitated by bubbling argon. These experi-
ments were carried out at 450 to 500°C, A summary of some of the
results is presented in Table 10.

Coneclusion

Three ~tential methods for reprocessing UC have been demonstrated.
It appears hat arc-meltin -casting would not be satisfactory for
refabrication unless plutc um losses can be controlled, The elec-
trolyeis process offers sv stantial decontamination. The CARBOX
process offers a potential saving of ~0.2 mill/kwh when compared to
an on-site aqueous reprocessing plant.

VOLATILITY PROCESSING OF FAST REACTOR FUEL*

Gustaaf J. Spaepen
Head of Chemical Technolegy, SCK-CEN
Mol, Belgium

Abstract

The choice of the type and size of the fluorinator in
fluoride volatility processing depends on many factors such
as heat dissipation, criticality, capacity and mass transfer.
An outline is given of the present state of development
studies at SCK~-CEN, Mol for the experimental determination of
the main factors for design and operation of an industrial
unit. The project is aimed at the reprocessing of the fuel
of one 1000 MWe fast breeder reactor.

.Introduction

The fluoride volatility processing method is considered
to be a total or partial alternative to other processing
methods for fast reactor fuel. The present R and D program
along this line in the SCK-CEN laboratorie?13t Mol is based
on the earlier work of J. Schmets and col. « The goal of
our program is the accumulation of the data, necessary to
evaluate a prototype reprocessing facility based on FVP.
Use of one or more volatility steps in an aqueous reproces-
sing scheme is considered to be likely and hence smaller
programs are set up at the side, in order to evaluate the
hybrid possibilities after completion of a major FVP-step.

The all-volatility line will be composed of a number of
steps including transport, reaction, absorption, condensation..
of gases and solids. These operations will have to be
performed on solids of as yet unknown reactivity, impurity
content, physical properties, etc. The gases to be used in
the flowsheet are better known. Fluorine is the only gas to
volatilize the Pu-compounds while the advantages of different
chleorine- and bromine-fluorides for the UF6-volatilization
have been widely discussed (2, 3, 4).

Furthermore, a high heat load in the process is to be
reckoned with because of radioactivity after short cooling
times and exothermicity of most of the chemical reactions.
Recovery of the valuable plutonium should be virtually
complete.

Like most of the laboratories working on FVP, we have
chosern the fluidized bed as the main equipment of the flow-
sheet. Development of its technology is seen in the frame of
continuously feeding powdered fuel of core and axial blanket
to the UF ,-reactors. Countercurrent flow of fluorine and/or
C1F/C1F és provided with intermittent condensation of PuF
and dilation with NZ' A schematic drawing is given in fig.1.

General Reactor Conditions

Most applications of continuous fluidization in non-
nuclear industries have the following features in common :

= beds of large diameters and large production rates

-~ Dbed composition of standardized grain sizes and bulk
densities

- recycling of the reactant gas

- c¢yclone recuperation of elutriated fines

- high linear gas velocities (10 - 100 v__)

- usually only one fluidized bed in the Circuit.

The situation of a FVP-plant based on fluidization will be
radically different :

- bYeds of small cross-section and moderate out-put

- bed composition of varying grain sizes and containing
solids of widely different densities

- recycling should be kept to a minimum because of costly
purification devices in the secondary lines

- 1large quantities of elutriated fines and necessity of
complete recuperation hence use of "absolute" dust filters

- linear gas velocities as low as possible to minimize
elutriation

- several beds in series.

tor fuelo

145
Moreover, because of the high heat load and the presence
of low melting compounds in the bed, accidental loss of
fluidization would lead to caking of the bed and destruction
of the equipment. Since linear velocities will be low, close
fluidization control by sensors is essential.

According to these general conditions for the use of fluid
beds in FVP and because of the unknown characteristics of the
high burn-up fuel of the future, several ground rules for the
development program at Mel were chosen @

- determination of the fuel powder particle size distribution
as a function of the fuel type and the milling characteris-
tics

= determination of the microkinetics of the different fuel
powders by thermogravimetry

- confirmation of the microkinetics in batch type fluidized
beds of laboratory scale (macrokinetics)

- determination of minimum fluidization velocities,
fluidization stability and heat transfer coefficients for
mixtures of extremely variable grain sizes and densities

- elutriation behaviour of the same mixtures for linear
velocities between 1.2 and 1.8 v £

- demonstration of reactors in serles with solids transport
by air-1ift and with representative on-line sampling of
solids and gases, leading to residence time determinations
fer both

- development of a fluidization sensor for linear velocities
between 1.2 and 1.8 ¥ and of recuperation devices other
than porous filters.

Development Program

The resulting development program is summarized in fig.2.
Only those tasks related to the development of the main
reactors for UF, and PuF, are indicated in this diagram. The
knowledge thus gained on fluidized beds of unusual operating
conditions, can directly be applied to the purification
circuits which consist primarily of less critical absorption
units, decomposers and UF6-U02 converters.

Before giving some illustrative results, we first indicate
briefly the progress made in our program. All the batch-type
units are in full operation including :

- thermal balance for unirradiated and for short-cooled,
high burn-up fuel

- a 100 kg UF,.-reactor automatically operated, with on-line
gas resistivity cells, UFs-condensation and absorption
units and scrubber

- a 10 kg UF,.-reactor, remotely controlled, for low activity
fuel - an on-line gamma spectrometer is installed

Descriptions of most of the equipment and installations

The microkinetics of the reactions of F,, ClF and ClF3 on
U0, and on simulated fast reactor core fuef are well
established. The relation to the macrokinetics in fluidized
bed is completed for UO, and underway for core fuel with
simulated high burn-up. The same holds for the determination
of the fluidization behaviour while the dynamics of slabs in
series as well as the construction of continuous single
reactors is scheduled for the end of 1969 and early 1970C.

Results

In order to illustrate the respective studies already
completed in our program a selection of typical results is
presented. More details can be found in the cited references
or in SCK-CEN progress reports, which can be made available
on request.

Microkinetics (9)

The microkinetics of fluorinating gases on pure UO_ -grains
fit the rate eqq7§ion, according to the decreasing sphere
model : (1 - F) = 1 - R't. Although physically speaking,
this model is meaningless for (U Pu)O2 and F,, the same
expression can be used : (1 - c)5/3 =21 - r' ¥t (table I).

In fig. 3 the dependence of this R'' on F_-concentration is
given for (U, 20 Pu)O, obtained by melting, hence with Pu in
solid solution. The %exture of the (U,Pu)0, solid solution
after volatilization of only part of the UO_ is shown in
fig. 4. As could be expected, the cracked grains splinter
into small fragments by the mechanical action in a fluidized
bed. Consequently the macrokinetic results for this case of
"molten" fuel differ very much from the thermogravimetric
results, although it still seems possible to relate one
another.

Macrokinetics (9)

The macrokinetic relationship for UO2 in C1F,; and F, still
follows the same rule : (1 - F)1/3 = 1 Z k't. Formatisn of
intermediates UO,F., and UF4 lead however to an induction
period which was not observed in microkinetics. The chosen
example (fig. 5) shows almost constant fluorine efficiencies
in the linear part of the curve and an abrupt decrease
towards the tail. Since the curve was obtained in a batch
experiment it is c¢lear that fluidization of the mixture
changed too much with increasing proportion of fines. The
shown curve is in fact a function (U ~ concentration, time)
and sets of curves for varying fluidization parameters were
used to extrapolate to continuous operation. The model was
also used to estimate the operation conditions for the 100 kg
demonstration unit for UFg-proeduction.

Flutonium mass balance in the semi-pilot installation

The results of the last step (F2 on Pu - containing
residue) of a series of experimentS in the plutonium semi-
pilot are summarized in table II. These experiments on
macrokinetics were carried out according to a fractional
factorial design (10). C1F; was used for the UFg volatili-
zation and Fp for the PuFg-step. Table II lists the
observations during the Pqu-formation and the over-all
mass-balance of the experiments.

Fluidigation behaviour

Fig. 6 is illustrative of the fluidization behaviour when
fines are present in the bed. Fluidization has been followed
visually, by pressure drop measurements and by the microwave
technique. Three regions can be observed as indicated on the
graph. It is worth mentioning that the experimental results
are very reproducible but differ greatly from the values
calculated according to literature data (11).

Powder characteristics

The results of milling experiments on different types of
fuel are summarized in table III. In combination with the
correct choice of alumina the fuel powder is directly
fluidizable. However, a better specification of the fraction
(= 37 u) is of importance with regard to elutriation losses
and cyclone or filter performance. Particle size measurements
are therefore scheduled using a sedimentation balance
technique.

Conclusions

The outlined program was chosen to lead directly to
operating conditions for a pilot unit. It is worth
mentioning that scale-up is not a matter of extrapolating
the data for emall diameter beds to very large diameter
beds. Instead, the concept leads to a slab reactor of small
width but considerable length which is divided into compart-
ments of about "laboratory"-scale. Once the system of
fluidized beds in series is under conmtrol, this concept
avoids the presently too complicated scaling-up of rather
unusual bed composition.

Parallel to the technological development work, a i}
theoretical group is working on modified mathematical models
for our fluid beds in order to evaluate the fresh data on
mixtures for potential applications outside the scope of the
programe.

REPROCESSING OF THTR FUEL ELEMENTS BY H1GH TEMPERATURE TREATMENT
AND CHLORINATION

Jurgen Hartwig and Klaus H. Ulrich

Fried., Krupp GMBH, Central Institute for Research and Development

Germany

For the reprocessing of irradiated nuclear fuel elements con-
taining the fuel in form of coated particles, a process has been
developed by which the coating is destroyed at high temperatures to
such a degree that the fuel can be extracted from the fuel element
or from a capsule containing the coated particles by chlorination.
Coated particles with metal carbide intercalations of SiC, for
instance, can also be handled without difficulty, The gas mixture
composed of volatile fuel chlorides and, possibly, of fertile and
fission product chlorides can be cooled and further treatment of
the condensed chlorides can take place in an aqueous solution
process, If development work is continued along the present lines,
fractional distillation and revolatilization appear sufficient to
permit the fractionating of halides as well.

The investigated synthetic fuel elements of the THTR types con-
tained the fuel and fertile material in the form of particles coated
with pyrolitic graphite or with a combination of graphite and sil-
icon carbide. The coated particles themselves were embedded in a
graphite matrix of normal porosity (approx. 20-25%). The fuel
elements were exposed to temperatures of 2400-3000 deg. C in a high-
temperature furnace having an argon atmosphere. This caused the
coating of the particles having a carbide core to be destroyed by
decomposition of the carbon and by the formation of intercalation
compounds., Polished sections show that after this high-temperature
treatment, the carbide fuel is freely exposed in the porous graphite
matrix so that it can be extracted via the gas phase. This unlock-
ing does not have the effect of changing the original shape of the
fuel elements. In the case of elements containing the fuel or
fissile material in the form of coated particles with cores of

159
U-Th-mixed oxide of the composition U-Th-03, this mixed oxide is
reduced upon high-temperature treatment to a mixed carbide by the
carbon of the coatings,

(u Th)o2 + (x + 2)C = (U Th)cx + 2C0

At a temperature of 2900 deg. C the resultant CO-equilibrium pres-
sures are sufficient to cause the particlie coatings to burst, the
matrix of the fuel elements disintegrating at the same time.

Upon subsequent extraction of the chloride, more than 99% of the
uranium was recovered. Kinetic investigations were carried out and
condensation equilibria measured. The pore space of the graphite
matrix and the distribution of the pores were determined. The
optimum flow velocity of the chlorine was determined by gravimetric
observation of the chlorination rate. The temperature dependence
of the chlorination process and the extraction of the chlorides
formed were investigated at temperatures between 200 and 1100 deg.
C. The apparent energy of activation was found to be 4,5 kcal/mol.
This, like the resultant 7372 dependence, suggest that gas diffusion
through the matrix graphite is a step determining the rate of
reaction. Separate condensation of uranium, thorium, and fission
product chlorides was investigated at different temperatures,

Process design and plant layout for the continuous operation of
this process are outlined,

ABSTRACT

A pilot plant fluoride volatility system for the recovery of
plutonium from impure oxide and residues has been built at the
Rocky Flats plant of The Dow Chemical Company. Studies have been
continuing for about one and one-half years. The results
obtained from this system have been encouraging and indicate that
plutonium recovery and purification from impure oxide is feasible,
Several significant chemical and engineering problems have been
encountered and resolved, Optimization and scale up of the
process will require further studies.

INTRODUCTION

The Dow Chemical Company operates the Rocky Flats plant, near
Denver, for the Atomic Energy Commission., The plant is part of
the AEC's Albuguerque Operations Office, which is charged with
major responsibilities for research, development, production and
storage of nuclear components, The work performed at the plant
includes phases of fabrication and assembly of plutonium parts,.
During the fabrication phases of the operation, plutonium scrap
is generated., Because of the value and the radiocactive properties
of the plutonium, it 1s necessary to recover the plutonium and
recycle it through the fabrication processes rather than discard
it,

The present plutonium recovery operation at Rocky Flats is an
aqueous process using nitric-~hydrofluoric acid solutions and ion
exchange for purification., The process is well known and has
been successfully used at Rocky Flats for 15 years; however, it
does have significant disadvantages including a high recycle
rate, major corrosion of process equipment, many process steps
and hand operations, and a high generation rate of agueous and
solid wastes requiring further processing.

Because of the high corrosion rate of the process equipment,
major replacement is required every five to 10 years. Volatile
fluoride reprocessing of plutonium has been investigated at
Rocky Flats for the past five years as a possible replacement
for the present agueous recovery system, Potential advantages
of a volatile fluoride process to Rocky Flats operations appear
to be:

l., Fewer process steps and less hand operations should result
in lower operating costs and less exposure of personnel to
radiation,

2o More complete plutonium recovery from oxides and possibly
from other residues should be obtained,

3« A lower generation rate of aqueous and solid wastes
requiring further processing.

L4e A more continuous and remote system should lower costs and
allow increased shielding to minimize radiation exposure
of operating personnel.

Studies were started on a gram-quantity static bed systeml’2
and were baseg largely on earlier work carried out at Argonnea’ 4,8
and Oak Ridge National Iaboratories, These studies indicated
that the process is feasible to separate plutonium from
impurities normally found in the Rocky Flats process streams,

164
A l-kg-scale pilot plant, utilizing a fluid bed, was therefore
designed and built, and plutonium experiments were started in
December, 1967. The purpose of the pilot plant is to determine
the feasibility of the process on a larger scale, to test the
design and operation of major process equipment on a larger scale
and to obtain operating and design data to be applied to a larger
(12 kg) production prototype system planned for operation in 1970.

PILOT PLANT

Figure 1 is a flow sheet of the pilot plant system, The fluid
bed is a 2-ine,-diameter vessel, 4 ft high, with a 5-in,~diameter
disengaging section, The bed is heated by a three~zone muffle
furnace, Prior to entry into the bed, the fluidizing gas passes
through a preheater capable of heating the gas to 550°C.
Additional heaters are installed on the lower part of the bed for
more complete temperature control, Dual nickel fiber filters in
the disengaging section prevent particle removal from the bed,
Blowback of the filters during the bed operation is possible to
prevent filter plugging and excessive pressure drops across the
filters,

The cold traps are L=in,-dlameter vessels approximately /4 ft
long. The cooling surface in one trap is longitudinal and in the
other, transverse, Fach trap has 12 sq ft of heat transfer
surface, Cooling of the traps is provided either by a refriger-
ation unit capable of cooling the system to =40°C or by liquid
nitrogen capable of -70°C, Strip heaters permit raising the
temperature of the traps to 300°C for removal of PuF, (by
refluorination) deposited by the radiolytic decomposition of PuFg.
This decamposition is equal to about 1.5 percent of the PuF6
present per day.

The traps are piped so that they can be used either in series
or parallel,

The hydrogen reductor is 2 in, in diameter by 18 in, longe It
is designed in such a way that different techniques can be tested
to reduce Pufg to PuF,, Methods that have been evaluated include
a hydrogen-thérmal reduction using a hydrogen-fluorine flame for
heat, hydrogen-thermal reduction using external resistance
heaters, and thermal decomposition on a static bed of PuF, or
Pu0,., Thermal decomposition on a fluid bed of PuF, or Pu0, was
alsg tested, The most successful method to date hés been a
hydrogen=thermal reduction using externmal heaters.

Packed bed sodium fluoride traps are used to trap any PuFg

escaping through the cold traps or the reductor, The traps are
heated at 150°C during operation by external strip heaters,

Charcoal traps are used to dispose of any unused fluorine, These
traps are externally air cooled to dissipate the heat from the
exothermic carbon-fluorine reaction and are maintained at no more
than 200°C.

A potassium hydroxide scrubber removes HF formed during the
hydrogen reductlon of PuF,, The scrubber is a 5-in,-diameter
Raschig ring=-filled veasei. A canned centrifugal pump recircu-
lates the solution, Excess hydrogen is burned and any remaining
off=gases pass through a water scrubber and into the bullding
exhaust system,

The fluid bed, cold traps, and reductor are fabricated from
nickel 200, All lines are 3/8-in, Monel tubing with compression
fittings. All lines used to transfer PuFy are equipped with
heating tape to preclude PuFg condensation and subsequent line
plugging, The 120 valves in the system are all Monel bellows=-
sealed globe valves with metal seats, About half of the valves
are alr operated and half hand operated, The fluorine recycle
compressor is a remote head, reciprocating diaphragm compressor
with an intermediate chamber filled with a fluorinated oil, The
process end diaphragm is Monel, A variable speed drive unit
provides flow rate adjustments,

The entire system, except the compressor drive, is enclosed in
a glovebox in order to contain the contamination, The exhaust
air from the glovebox passes through a water scrubber to remove
any fluorine that may have leaked from the system into the box,

About 30 separate experimental runs have been made, including
four initial runs using uranium to check out the system, Each
run has been designed to obtain specific data on one or more
steps of the operation. Therefore, no extended production-type
runs to test the potential capacity of such a system have been
made, The reliability and service life of the equipment have
also not been established because of the limited running time to
date, In some cases, extensive modification of the system was
made between runs,

RESULTS

Preliminary runs on the pilot plant system were made using
depleted uranium in order to check ocut the equipment and make
any final changes before introducing plutonium contamination,.
After several runs and some equipment modification, satisfactory
performance was achieved and plutonium studies were started, To
date a8 total of about 20 kg of plutonium has been put through the
entire system,

167
Fluid Bed Conversion of PuO, to PuFy

Figures 2 and 3 show the original designs of the fluid bed.
The original gas distribution system, as seen in Figure 2, was
a nickel ball. The plutonium oxide, having a bulk density of
Le8 gfcc, was mixed with an equal weight of -40 to +100 mesh
aluminum oxide, The alumina was to act as a thermal conductivity
media and as a diluent, With this system, difficulties were
experienced with rapid and excessive temperature increases from
5450 to 800°C due to the exothermic Pu0, to PuF, reaction. This
temperature spike caused a sintering o% the Pul, to a density of
647 g/cc and a plugging of the bed, In some cases, severe
corrosion of the nickel ball resulted, By adding a vibrator to
the bed, some uniformity in the depletion rate was observed, but
generally the results were poor; sintering or packing occurred,
the total depletion and depletion rate were poor, and there was
severe fluorine attack on the nickel ball.

The distributor arrangement was then changed as shown in
Figure 3, A layer of 20~mesh nickel spheres, which extended into
the heated zone, was used as the distribution system. Glass
column tests indicated that the alumina was of 1little benefit,
because the PuO, segregated from the alumina after short periods
of bed operation, Therefore, alumina was eliminated in subsequent
runs, Temperature excursions continued to unpredictably occur,
In one case, the temperature increased from 550 to 1200°C in 30
seconds, causing the nickel distribution spheres to fuse and form
a solid pluge By carefully controlling the temperature, the gas
flow rate, the filter blowback cycle, and by vibrating the bed,
the temperature excursions could be minimized, Depletion rates
of 70 g/nr were achieved; however, a small static layer of Pu0,
was observed at the nickel interface,

Further studies were made on various gas distribution and bed
designs using a glass colum, It was found that a cone with a
2=-degree taper provided complete agitation of all of the bed
material and was much less sensitive to particle size distribu=-
tion., It was further observed that the velocity of the gas at
the bed inlet was sufficiently high to prevent the material in
the fluid bed from dropping into the inlet line. Using this
information, the fluid bed was modified as shown in Figure 4,
This is the current design of the bed and 12 runs have been made
with this system, The bed has functioned well using the 2=
degree taper. The runs have proceeded to depletion without
temperature excursions or sintering using Pu0, as feed material,
A vibrator was installed on the bed and a depletion rate of 160
g/hr was achieved at a fluorine velocity of 2.3 ft/second.
Increasing the velocity resulted in a decrease in depletion rate,
accompanied by an inability to reduce the filter pressure drop
by backblowing. An increase in depletion rate with increased

Purification

Analytical data of impurities inthe feed and product indicates
that good purification factors are achieved for common impurities
found in the Rocky Flats process stream, In one run, 1000 ppm
each of 13 common impurities were added to the feed material,
Table II shows the purification achieved on this run in the
2~degree tapered bed, In early runs, prior to passivation of
the equipment, same copper and nickel contamination was picked
up from the Monel and nickel surfaces, In later runs this has
not been a problem,

Irapping

Two types of cold traps were tested for their efficiency in
collecting the PuFge. One type has transverse cooling fins and
the second has longitudinal cooling fins, Cooling was by
refrigeration or liquid nitrogen. Both cold trap configurations
trapped over 1 kg of PuFy at an efficiency of 99.5% or better,
Because liquid nitrogen cooling reduces the losses through the
traps to virtually nothing, the best combination for trapping
on a production scale presently appears to be a trap with
longitudinal fins and liquid nitrogen for cooling,

PuFz Reduction

Different techniques have been investigated for the reduction
of PuFg to PuF), or directly to metal, Table IIT is a sumary of
the methods studied and an indication of the results. To date
the most successful method has been the thermal-~hydrogen
reduction to Pth. Figure 5 shows the latest design for this
type of reduction. The PuFg is swept from the cold traps with
nitrogen or argon, preheated to about 300°C, and reacted with
hydrogen in the reductor, With extended runs using this concept,
essentially complete decomposition of the PuF; was achieved.

Some caking on the filters results; therefore blowback provisions
are provided, Several batches of PuF, prepared by the
fluorination of PuO, and subsequent reduction to the tetrafluoride
have been reduced to the metal by calcium reduction. In all cases
the reductions proceeded smoothly and efficiently.

If PuF, could be reduced directly to metal, one process step
could be eliminated. Small-scale studies were made on the calcium
reduction of PuFg. The studies indicated that the reduction could
be made at 25°C or lower; however, the resulting plutonium was in
the form of fine powder rather than a single button. This would
cause potential problems with further handling and fabrication of
the plutonium because of the pyrophoric nature of the fine metal
powder-~additional laboratory studies could probably resolve this
problem,

Material Balance

Table IV shows the material balance for five typical runs, The
high PuF, decomposition in the cold trap in the first runs reflect
the largé quantity of PuFg collected and the period of time (up to
two weeks) held in the trap, The results of the second through
fifth run reflect the high efficiency of plutonium removal by the
cold trap and the completeness of decomposition in the reductor.

Regidue Processing

Studies have started on the recovery of plutonium from
residues by the volatility process, Initial studies on plutonium
containing electrorefining salts (KC1-NaCl-MgCl,) indicate that a
double fluoride salt containing plutonium is formed rather than
the volatile PuFg. If this cannot be overcome, then plutonium in
residue salts from molten salt processes cannot be recovered
directly by fluoride wvolatility.

Other studies are underway on calcium fluoride slag formed
during the reduction of Pth with calcium, This slag contains
some plutonium which must be recovered, Studies to date indicate
that the plutonium can be.volatilized and removed from the slagj
however, an unpredictable and significant temperature rise often
cccurs during the fluorination., This is thought to be due to the
highly exothermic reaction of fluorine with calcium or impurities
contained in the slag, This reaction can be controlled by a
preoxidation of the slag and by insuring that no impurities are
introduced into the slag prior to fluorination,

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

It has been demonstrated on a 1l-kg scale pilot plant that the
volatile fluoride process is feasible for the recovery and purifi-
cation of plutonium from impure oxide. Based on the pilot plant
studies, the process appears economically favorable when compared
to the present aqueous process, Studies are continuing on

on the behavior of uranium and plutonium. The described ex-
periments include the use of BrF_ and fluorine as well as fluorine
alone as the fluorinating agent go convert product oxides to
volatile fluorides. Results are summarized on the behavior of
fission product ruthenium in separations steps, on the

INTRODUCTION

A discussion of the fluoride volatility process must be
oriented to the chemical and radiochemical properties of the fuel
to be processed. This review includes selected aspects of a lab-
oratory-scale program in which the processing of both LWR and LMFBR
fuels was studied.

Figure 1 shows the fission product content of an oxidic LWR fuel
irradiated to 10,000 MWd/T and cooled 30 days. This fuel contains
primarily UO,, slightly enriched in 235U, and 10 kg fission pro-
ducts and "4"kg plutonium per ton of fuel. A little less than
40% of the 4 megacuries of activity per ton of fuel is emitted
by those fission products having volatile fluorides.

Figure 2 shows similar information for a LMFBR fuel containing
axial blanket and core fuel sections as they are likely to be
combined in large LMFBR reactors. The data were calculated
assuming & core burnup of 100,000 MWd/T and a 30~-day cooling
period. The blanket fuel contains depleted uranium oxide and 2%
plutonium oxide, while the core fuel, which represents the major
fraction of the total, contains ~20%Z plutonium oxide together
with uranium oxide and fission products. The fraction of the total
curies represented by fission products whose fluorides are volatile
is not very different from that shown in Figure 1 but the total
curies per ton is significantly greater in LMFBR fuel than in LWR
fuel.

The LWR and IMFBR oxide fuels to be processed, therefore, con-
tain plutonium at concentrations of 0.5 to 20%, fission products
at concentrations between 1 and 10%, and depleted uranium as the
balance of the metallic fuel constituents, Although cladding is
not an important concern of the present discussion, LWR fuels are
generally clad in Zircaloy and LMFBR fuels are clad in a 300 series
stainless steel.

The processing steps of the fluoride volatility process include
a head-end operation, which removes the massive hardware from the
ends of a subassembly, a2 step that separates the oxide fuel from
the cladding, one or more steps that convert the oxides to fluo-
rides, and several process steps in which the actinide fluorides
are separated from each other and purified from fission product
contamination. This paper will include descriptions of laboratory
studies on the conversion of oxide to fluoride carried out in
a fluidized bed, a description of selected results on the chemistry
of ruthenium and neptunium, and a summary of small-scale experi-
ments on irradiated oxidic fuels,

FLUORINATION STUDIES IN A 2-IN., DIA. REACTOR

A fluoride volatility process with BrF. and fluorine as
fluorinating agents was studied in a 2-in’ diameter fluidized-
bed reactor with sintered alumina as the inert bed material
and a feed of UO,-Pu0, pellets containing nonradiocactive oxides
of elements formed in fission. The pellets, together with oxides
added separately to the alumina bed, simulated the processing of
spent low-enrichment UO, fuel at burnups of 10,000 and 30,000
MWd/T. The processing of simulated fast reactor fuel (100,000
MWd/T) was also studied, using a feed of U0,-20 wt 7% PuO, powder
(=325 mesh) and nonradioactive fission product oxides. "The
objective of the studies was the determination of operating con-
ditions to minimize residual uranium and plutonium in the fluidized
bed, which is discarded as waste from the process.

A typical experiment consisted of oxidation of the pellets or
powder at 450°C with 20 vol Z 0,, fluorination of most of the
uranium with dilute (10 to 20 vol %) BrF. or fluorine at 200 to
400°C, and fluorination of the plutonium”with concentrated recycled
fluorine (90 vol %) at temperatures ranging from 300 to 550°C.

A typical charge to the reactor consisted of 1100 g of sintered
alumina (40 to 170 mesh) as the fluidized bed and 650 g of pellets
containing, in the case of the LWR fuel, 560 g uranium and 2.8 to
3.2 g plutonium and , for the fast reactor fuel, 460 g uranium
and 115 g plutonium. The major components of the experimental
apparatus are the 2-in, dia fluidized-bed reactor, a remote-head
diaphragm pump for gas recycle, soda lime traps for disposal of
excess chemical reagents and UF, produced during the BrF_ step,
activated-alumina traps for the disposal of excess fluorine
reagent, and sodium fluoride traps for the collection of PuF
produced during the recycle-fluorination step. Detailed desériptions
of these components and of the experimental procedures have been
reported elsewhere,(1,2)

Fluorination of Low-Enrichment UO, Fuels with BrF. and Fluorine

To verify that selective fluorination of uranium from plutonium
had occurred during the BrF_ step at 400°C, samples from the soda
lime traps used for disposai of the UF,, unreacted BrF_., and
bromine reaction product were analyzed for plutonium, “These
samples contained 4 x 10~ to 9 x 1053 wt % Pu which, from ex-
perience with the equipment used in sampling and grinding the
soda lime in preparation for analysis, is known to be within the
background level of cross-contamination. These results indicate
that essentially none of the plutonium is converted to volatile
PuF, during fluorination with BrF .3 an average of approximately
0.7% of the uranium charged remained in the fluidized bed after

fluorination with BrFS. O0f this amount, 96% was fluorinated during

180
the subsequent recycle-~fluorination with fluorine so that only
about 0.025% (0.14 g) of the original uranium remained in the final
alumina bed. (3)

The operating conditions used during the BrF. step (when most
of the uranium is fluorinated) and during the récycle-fluorination
step (when plutonium is fluorinated) appear to affect the fluorination
of plutonium from the fluidized bed. For example, the data shown
in Fig. 3 depict the plutonium concentrations in the fluidized bed
during recycle fluorination following fluorination of uranium with
BrF_ at 200, 300, and 400°C. From the relative rates of plutonium
remdoval and the final plutonium concentrations in the fluidized
bed, it appears that the temperature at which uranium is fluorinated
with BrF_ affects the subsequent plutonium fluorination and that the
uranium Should be fluorinated at temperatures below 400°C, Additional
experiments in which the BrF. step was carried out at 250 and
350°C showed that plutonium fluorination was similar to the curve
shown after a 300°C BrF_. step; consequently, the fluorination of
uranium with BrF shoulg be carried out at temperatures from 250
to 350°C to minimize the effects of this fluorination step on the
subsequent fluorination of plutonium. Hence, most experiments
were completed with the BrF5 step at 300°C.

The procedure used in the fluorination of plutonium also
affects the final concentration of plutonium in the fluidized
bed as shown in Fig. 4, These data were obtained from experiments
in which uranium was previously fluorinated with BrF_ at 300°C.
Temperature Sequence A (Figure 4) represents a fluorénation scheme
of 1 hr at 450°C followed by 3 hr at 500°C and 8 hr at 550°C.
Sequence B is similar except that in this experiment the initial
period of 3 hr at 300°C was followed by a gradual increase in
temperature from 300 to 550°C for 5 hr and then an additional 2 hr
at 550°C. The reaction of plutonium appears to be significantly
different in these two schemes, but the mechanisms responsible for
this difference are not clear.t3s4) However, low residual
plutonium concentrations in the bed can be achieved by performing
the BrF_. step at 250 to 350°C and by starting the subsequent
fluoriné step at about 300°C and increasing the temperature
gradually to 550°C.(3,4)

For a typical experiment with a BrF, step at 300°C and a
plutonium fluorination step as shown in Figure 3, about 3% of
the plutonium charged remains in the fluidized bed. The fraction
of the plutonium charge remaining in the bed can be reduced if
several batches of pellets could be processed with a single
alumina bed without an increase in plutonium concentration. To
demonstrate the reuse of an alumina bed, two sets of experiments
were completed, each set using a single bed of alumina to process
three batches of fuel pellets at simulated burnups of 10,000 MWd/T
for one set and 30,000 MWd/T for the other.(4) These experiments

the Flucrination of Plutonium
were carried out by repeating part of the reaction cycle, i.e.,

the oxidation and BrF, steps, allowing the plutonium to accumulate,
and then fluorinating the accumulated plutonium in a single
fluorination step with fluorine., The progress of reaction during
the oxidation and fluorination steps for the low-burnup fuel is
shown in Figure 5. The fluoride content of the final bed was

3.5 wt %, which corresponded to fluorination of 2,7% of the original
alumina bed., Similarly, the final bed contained 0.003 wt Z U and
0.009 wt % Pu, corresponding to ~0,01% and 1,3% of the total charge
of uranfum and plutonium, respectively. Figure 6 shows changes

in the fluidized-bed composition as the accumulated plutonium was
fluorinated for the higher burnup fuel. The fluoride cvontent of
the final bed was 10.4 wt % indicating that 8.8% of the original
alumina had been fluorinated to A1lF,. The final bed also contained
0.012 wt % U and 0.009 wt Z Pu, corfesponding to <0.01% of the
total uranium and 0,752 of the total plutonium charged to the
reactor.

Fluorination of Low-Enrichment UQ, Fuels with Only Fluorine

In pilot-plant studies(5!6) with U0, pellets, a two-zone method
of simultaneously oxidiziug and fluorinating a batch of fuel
pellets in a fluidized-bed reactor was demonstrated under controllea
temperature conditions to yield high UF, production rates, and high
fluorine utilization. When this processing scheme was applied to
pellets containing plutonium, approximately 80 to 100% of the
uranium and 50 to 70% of the glutonium charged in the pellets was
reacted in 3 hr of operation. 1,2) However, cesium, added to the
bed as finely powdered CsF, appeared to influence plutonium
fluorination and to increase the residual plutonium concentration
in the bed. The effects of the added cesium were largely overcome (1,2)
with a stepwise oxidation and fluorination procedure. In particular,
fluorination of uranium at 350°C, followed by recycle~fluorination
in the temperature range 350° to 550°C, was effective in reducing
residual plutonium in the alumina bed to 0.009 wt %, corresponding
to the retention of 3,5% of the plutonium charge. As shown in
Figure 7, the relative plutonium retained by the alumina bed was
reduced further by reusing a single bed to process three batches
of fuel pellets with this reaction sequence. The uranium and
plutonium concentration in the final alumina bed were both 0.009 wt Z,
corresponding to the retention of “0.01% of the uranium and 1.2Z
of the plutonium in the pellet charge.

The alumina bed was not significantly altered mechanically or
chemically in the sets of alumina-reuse experiments reported here,
and it is concluded that a single batch of alumina can be used to
process three batches of fuel pellets at simulated burnups of
10,000 and 30,000 MWA/T to effectively reduce plutonium losses
for a fluidized-bed fluoride volatility process.

Fluorination of Fast Reactor Fuel with Fluorine

Fast breeder fuels were simulated using a solid solutiomn U02-
Pu0, powder (mean particle size ~5 um) containing 17.8 wt %
plu%onium and 70.3 wt Z uranium, This powder, together with a
mixture of nonradicactive oxides of the elements formed in fission,
was proportioned to simulate FBR fuel with a burnup of 100,000 MWd/T.

The initial scoping experiments consisted of a fractional
factorial series of five experiments to determine the effects on
plutonium in the final fluidized bed for (1) two levels of fuel-
to~alumina ratio (0.3 and 0.6), (2) fluorination temperature
(350 and 450°C) with 10 vol %Z F, for uranium fluorination, and
(3) recycle-fluorination time (EO and 20 hr)} for plutonium
fluorination. The 20-hr recycle-fluorination sequence consisted
of 4 hr at 300°C, 3 hr each at 350, 400, 450, and 500°C, and 4 hr
at 500°C while the 10-hr sequence incorporated 3 hr at 450°C,

3 hr at 500°C, and 4 hr at 550°C, This latter sequence was
chosen in an effort to obtain high fluorination rates for plutonium.

For the five experiments, the fraction of charged plutonium
in the final bed ranged from 0.51 to 3.19% with only one ex-
periment significantlyabove 1% of the plutonium charge in the
final bed. The conclusions drawn from the statistical analysis
are that an increase in the fuel/zlumina ratio from 0.3 to 0.6
and an increase in the temperature of fluorination with dilute
fluorine from 350 to 450°C will increase the fraction of plutonium
charge remaining in the fluidized bed; conversely, increasing the
recycle-fluorination time from the 10-hr to the 20-hr sequence
will reduce the fraction of plutonium charge remaining in the bed.

The highest rates of plutonium fluorination were obtained
during the initial part of recycle-fluorination sequence except
in one experiment when low rates during this period apparently
resulted from an initial recycle fluorination temperature of
300°C which followed fluorination with dilute fluorine at 450°C.
For the remaining experiments, the production rate for PuF
averaged 1.2 to 3.0 1b/(hr) (ft2) while the reactor 0perateg at
17.2 to 55.4% of equilibrium for the reaction PuF, (s) + F2 (g) 2
PuF,(g). As had been found for the fluorination of uranium, 8)
the diminishing-sphere reaction model was tested and appeared to
correlate the data for plutonium fluorination during the jinitial
recycle~fluorination period. Rate constants of 0.7 x 10~ min~!
at 300°C and 4.4 x 10-3 min~1 at 450°C (i.e., average result for
3 experiments) correspond to an apparent activation energy of
10 kcal/mole.

In summary, fluorination of simulated LWR fuel using BrF
followed by elemental fluorine or using dilute fluorine foliowed
by concentrated fluorime converted a large fraction of uranium
and plutonium to their volatile hexafluorides, which volatilized

188
from the fluidized bed, The temperature of initial fluorination
was shown to affect subsequent plutonium removal from the bed.
Reuse of the alumina bed to process three fuel charges reduced the
fractional loss of plutonium to the alumina to 1%, Corresponding
experiments with simulated FBR fuel indicated that low plutonium
losses can be obtained in a single use of the alumina bed.

BEHAVIOR OF FISSION PRODUCTS AND NEPTUNIUM

Recent experimental work to elucidate the behavior of fission
products and neptunium has been concerned mainly with behavior
during two process operations: the fluorination operation, in
which actintdes are separated from nonvolatile fission product
fluorides and some gsubsequent operations in which actinides are
separated from volatile fission product fluorides. A fuel recovery
process will include a separation of neptunium from uranium and
plutonium regardless of whether the neptunium is treated as a by~
product to be recovered or as an impurity to be discarded.

Behavior of Neptunium in Fluorination Processes

The behavior of neptunium in the fluorination operation has
been investigated both in small-scale boat-reactor experimenta(g)
and in the 2-in. diameter fluid-bed experiments.(3,4) Reactions
of NpF, with gaseous BrF3, BrF., and F, in the boat reactor were
carrieé out at 300-400°C. The neptunium product of the reaction
was NpF_ with each fluorinating agent; bromine was also produced
in fluorinations with BrF5 and BrF3.

The fluorination of NpO, by either fluorine or BrF_ was
found to proceed through tﬁe formation of the intermeaiate NpF
(identified by X-ray diffraction analysis). The mechanism of
fluorination of NpO,, therefore, parallels that of Pu0O, (which
proceeds through thé intermediate PuF,), but differs from the
fluorination of UOZ’ which proceeds tﬁrough the intermediate
U02F » Apparent rate constants were obtained for both the boat
reac%or and fluid-bed experiments from correlation of the data
by the rate law that assumes reaction occurs at a continuously
diminishing spherical interface. The apparent rate constants
obtained in the boat reactor experiments were correlated by the
Arrhenius equation to yield an activation energy of 20 kcal/mol
for the reaction of NpF, with elemental fluorine. An independent
study(lo) of the rate o? reaction of NpF4 with fluorine yielded
the same activation energy.

4

The fluorination of NpO, from mixtures with simulated oxide
fuel pellets was demonstrated with both BrF_ and fluorine in
the 2-in. diameter fluidized-bed reactor. %he NpF, product was
distributed about equally between the UF6 produced during

189
radd€fon with BrYF_ and the PuF, produced in the subsequent
reaction with fludrine, The amount of neptunium added to the
simulated fuel was a factor of 40 more than would be expected in
650 g of apent fuel irradiated to 10,000 MWd/T. Excess neptunium
was provided so that its concentration in the bed samples would be
abouve the limit of analytical detection, which was affected by

the plutonium concentration. After 2 hr of fluorination with BrF
(10.¥0l1 %), an average of 46% of the original neptunium remained
in the fludidizrd-bed. This- result- corresponded to a reaction .rate
constant for the diminishing-sphere model of 2 x 10-3 min‘l, a
factor of 10 bigher than the rate constant obtained in the boat
reactor tests with 33-35 vol % BrP_. The -difference-4n rate constants
may be attributed to a more highly reactive NpF, being formed by
reaction 6T NpO, and BrF. in the fluidized bed wince the NpF, used
in the boat reactor expetiments was obtained by reaction of ﬁpo2
with HF and oxygen at 500°C. The apparent rate constant is
inversely proportional to both the particle size and the bulk
density of the initial reactant, Higher specific surface areas
and lower bulk densities may have been obtained in the fluidized-
bed experiments. Other factors promoting higher apparent reaction
rates in the fluifdized bed are better gas-solids contacting and
the influence of elutriation.

After the subsequent fluorinacion with fluétrine, neptunium
concentration in the fluidized bed was below the limit of analytical
detection, indicating that less than 7% of the original neptunium
remained in the final alumina bed. It is important to note that
in a fluidized-bed fluoride volatility process which utilizes
both BrF. and fluorine, volatile NpF, is formed in both fluorination
steps, ahd about one-half of the original neptunium will accompany
each of the UF, and the PuF, products. The removal of neptunium
from the fluidized bed by fiuorination is represented graphically
in Figure 8 for fluorination of the fuel by BrF_ and by fluorine
and is illustrated in Figure 6 for the recycle éluorination of
plutonium with fluorine.

Reaction of NpF, with Brz(ll)

In the experiments described above, the reaction of NpF
with either BrF_. or BrF, in a gas~flow enviromment with continuous
removal of products from the reaction site resulted in a net
production of NpF,, A reaction was observed to occur, however,
in the traps in which the products of the boat reactor fluorination
of NpF, with either BrF. or BrF, had been condensed. These reactions
Btarteé at temperatures in the fange ~78 to +30°C, indicating that
NpF, must be readily reduced by bromine. Additional experiments
in which bromine was condensed onto NpF, at -78°C, then warmed to
430°C confirmed these indications. For the gas-phase reaction of
NpF, with bromine at +80°C, the measured pressure change was con-
Bisgant with the stoichiometry of the equation:

Since UF, is not reduced by bromine, the reaction with bromine
offers a means of separating UF, from NpF,. This separation
process was demonstrated experimentally. Stoichiometric-excesses
of bromine were condensed onto 1l:1 mixtures of UF, and NpF_ at
-78°C  After a reaction period at a higher temperature, the
volatile materials were distilled away from the reaction.-mixture,
and both the volatile and nonvolatile fractions were analyzed for
neptunium and uranium, Table I shows that at 30°C the reaction
did not go to completion even after several hours, >ut that after
reaction at 75°C for one hour, 99.9% of the neptunium found by
analysis was in the nonvolatile fractiom.

Reaction of NpF, with NaF

The removal of volatile metallic fluorides from gas streams
by reaction with solid NaF to form solid complex compounds has
been frequently included in volatility process schemes. The
reaction of solid NaF with gaseous NpF6 was studied to obtain
Information on the stoichiometry of the reaction and the identity
and stability of the product in order to assess the feasibility
of using solid NaF to remove NpF6 from gaseous mixtures.

It was observed that, at temperatures >150°C, powdered NaF
reacts readily with gaseous NpF, with the formation of a violet
solid product. The equation 3NaF(s) + NpF_(g) Z 3NaF:NpF_(s) +
1/2 F,(g) was found to represent the equilibrium involved in the
react%on of NpF, with NaF at 250 to 400°C, The partial pressures
of flvorine and NpF, in equilibrium with the solid phase formed
by reaction of NpF, with NaF were obtained by measurements of
total pressure and ultraviolet absorbance of the gas phase. At
a fixed temperature (350°C) over a 16-fold variation of fluerime
pressure, the value of log (PNpF_) was found to depend linearly
on log (ﬁF ) with a proportionalgty coefficient of 0.49, comparable
to the valie of 1/2 expected iygm'thE'equattun. Equiitbrium
constants, K ~ (PNpF )/ (PF. ) , for the reaction at 250 to 400°C,
are expressed by the aqiation:

log Kp(atm]'/z) - -3.147 x 10°/T(°K) + 2.784

The equilibrium constants given by the above relation were
used to caluclate the extent of removal of NpF, from mixtures
with UF6 in a proposed operation at the followgng conditions:

(1) Gaseous UF_ -NpF, mixtures, with no initial fluorine,
would be passéd through a ped of WaF pellets with the
intention of maximum fixation of neptunium and minimun
fixation of uranium by the solid phase.

(2) The residence time would be sufficient to allow the
reaction of N‘pF6 with NaF to reach equilibrium,

(3) The partial pressure of UF, in the mixture would be
less than the dissociation pressure of either of the
complexes formed between NaF and UF6 (NaF-UF6 and
2NaF-UF6).

The initial NpF, pressures were fixed by chosen concentrations of
NpF, in UF, and the dissociation pressures of 2NaF:UF, calculated
from the data of Katz, (13) indicating the pressure below which
the UF6 must be maintained to avoid formation of 2NaF-UF6.

Figure 9 presents the results of calculations of the maximum
percentage of NpF, that would be removed by one equilibrium stage
for concentrations of NpF, in UF, warying from 10 to 1C00 ppm at
temperatures of 250, 300, 350, and 409°C. Figure 10 presents
similar information for two equilibrium stages (equilibration of
gas mixture with NaF, removal of fluorine formed in the reaction
of NpF, with NaF, and equilibration of the residual gas mixture
with a second NaF trap). Two-stage operation would be realized,
for example, if the UF, stream passed in sequence through a NaF
trap, a distillation column, and then a second NaF trap. In
general, the fraction of NpF, removed increases as the initial
concentration of NpF, increases; the percentage of NpF, removed
also increases as the temperature of the NaF bed decreases. Since
the probable initial concentration of NpF, in the UF, process
stream is low (100 ppm), the extent of rémoval in a single
equilibrium stage is not high. Calculations were performed at
409°C since the temperature of a NaF trap must be kept above this
value to pass UF, vapor at 1.75 atm, a favored process pressure,
without formation of 2NaF:UF,., At these conditions, the calculations
shown in Figures 9 and 10 ingicate that about 46% of the neptunium
would be removed by one equilibrium stage and that about 70% of
the neptunium would be removed by two equilibrium stages.

Behavior of Volatile Fission Product Fluorides in the Fluorination
Operation

Experiments(4) determining fission product behavior during
fluorination of simulated oxide fuel in the 2-in. diameter
fluidized bed were limited to elements forming volatile fluorides.
To aid in following ruthenium in the various processing steps,

Ru was added to the alumina bed in an experiment in which the
BrF5 step was carried out at 300°C. Additionally, a spark source
mass spectrometric analysis was used to determine the distribution
of ruthenium, molybdenum, and rhodium in experiments with the BrF
step at 250 and 350°C. The results indicate that volatilization
of most of the ruthenium takes place during fluorination with
BrF_. at 300°C followed by only minor fluorination of ruthenium
during the recycle~fluorination with fluorine at 300 to 550°C.
These results are in ggreement with those obtained in boat
reactor tests with 10°Ru tracer and in fluidized-bed tests with
irradiated fuel. Table II gives the results of spark source
mass spectrometric analyses of fluidized-bed and sodium fluoride
samples for experiments with the BrF5 step at 250 and 350°C,

Separation of Ruthenium from PuF
18

Recent experimental studies of the separation of volatile
fission product fluorides from FuF, have centered on PuF_-
ruthenium fluoride mixtures since past experience showed that

this separation might prove difficult.
ruthenium mixtures was tested in bench-scale experiments.

The

general procedure consisted of (a) fluorinating mixtures of 200-

400 mg of PuF

and 15-20 mg of ruthenium metal (containing

Within these limitations, the spark source data

The behavior of plutonium-
to permit radiochemical analysis), (b) transporting the resulting
gaseous mixture by gas flow through a train of vessels, each
simulating a process vessel and corresponding process operation,
and (c¢) determining the final distribution of plutonium and
ruthenium in the train. Early results caused a shift in the main
point of attention to the operation in which ruthenium and plutonium
fluorides were to be separated by preferential condensation at
-10°C. At this temperature, the vapor pressure of pure PuF, is
7.89 Torr, which is greater than the partial pressure of P in
the effluent gas stream of the fluorination operation. The vapor
pressure of RuF_. at ~10°C is 2.6 x 10‘6Torr, suggesting that
passage of the gases formed by fluorination of ruthenium-
plutonium mixtures through a trap at -10°C should result in
condensation of only Rqu.

The results, presented in Table III, indicate that, although
the amounts of ruthenium penetrating the traps at -10°C are small
fractions of the total ruthenium charged to the reactor, they are
orders of magnitude greater than the calculated amounts that
should penetrate the trap on the basis that the solid phase in
the traps is Rqu.

The quantities of ruthenium penetrating the traps at -78°C
are of special interest, since at this temperature, the vapor
pressures of any ruthenium species are sufficiently low that only
a small quantity of any species is required to form a solid
phase in the trap. The comparison of observed amounts of
ruthenium transpiring through the trap with theoretical amounts
calculated from the vapor pressures of various ruthenium species
could, therefore, identify the solid species in the trap. The
agreement of theoretical and observed moles of PuF penetratins
the ~78°C trap had shown that the trap is efficieng for PuF

Five of the seven results in Table III show that the quantities
of ruthenium transpiring at -78°C are the same order of magnitude
as the quantities calculated for RuO,. If Ru0, is indeed formed,
the question of the source of oxygen arises. &he formation of
very small quantities of RuO, might be explained by the presence
of traces of moisture in the system or by the presence of an
oxide film on the ruthenium metal powder.

The results of the entire set of experiments listed in
Table III can be summarized as follows: (1) A small fraction of
the total ruthenium charged to the system formed a compound more
volatile than RuF_. in the reaction of fluorine at 500°C with
ruthenium metal, Futhenium metal-alumina mixtures, or ruthenium
metal-PuF, mixtures. (2) In five of seven experiments, the
observed quantities of ruthenium transpiring at -78°C were the
same order of magnitude as the quantities calculated for RuO,.
(3) This set of experiments indicates no consistent difference
between the volatility of ruthenium compounds produced by

BENCH-SCALE STUDIES WITH IRRADIATED FUELS

Eleven experiments using fluidized-bed fluoride volatility
techniques to proeess irradiated metal alloy and oxide fuels were
performed in a hot cell facility. The principal objectives of
these experiments were:

1. to establish whether filssion products or radiation fields
have a significant effect upon the recovery of the
fissionable values in the fuel;

2. to determine actinide and fission element distribution
from irradiated fuels and for the various process steps;

3. to determine product decontamination from the fission
elements for established process steps and to test
other schemes having process potential.

Of the six experiments run with alloys, two were with uranium-
Zircaloy irradiated to ~40% burnup of the 235y originally present
and cooled 5 yr, and four experiments were with uranium-aluminum
irradiated to 50% burnup and cooled either 3 or 7 months, TFive
experiments were performed with uranium oxide fuel irradiated to
a burnup of ~33,000 MWd/T and cooled 1 to 1 1/2 yr.

Tests with Irradiated Uranium Alloy Fuels

The process, which has been described in detail, (14,13,16)
involves the use of a fluidized bed of alumina to provide gas
contacting of the fuel., Hydrogen chloride gas separates the
zirconium or aluminum matrix from the uranium by forming volatile
chlorides with the zirconium or aluminum while converting the
uranium to a nonvolatile chloride. A filter bed of packed alumina
particles downstream of the fluid-bed reactor prevents uranium
loss from the fluidized-bed. Elemental fluorine removes the
uranium from the bed by converting it to gaseous UF,. Sodium
fluoride beds and a cold trap operating at -78°C coilect and
decontaminate the UF6'

An equipment flowsheet is shown in Figure 11, The hydro-
chlorination step is performed with valve V1 closed and valve
V2 open. The gas mixture flows from the packed-bed filter to
the condenser, through the disposable filter to the scrubber,
and then to the atmosphere through the cave stack. The ZrCl
(or AlCl3) generated in the reactor is removed from the gas stream

by a condenser cooled by natural convection. Experience with the
unirradiated fuels showed that a filter 1s required after the con-
denser to remove chloride fines, which would otherwise cause
plugging of the line to the scrubber. The filter is a small
section of pipe, packed with glass wool, which can be removed

and replaced remotely for each run, Excess HCl is scrubbed from
the nitrogen gas stream by continuously recirculated H,0, NaOH,

or KOH solution before discharge of the gas to the caveé exhaust
duct.

When the hydrochlorination step is complete, the high-
temperature valves are reversed (V1 opened, V2 closed) and the
fluorination step begun, During the fluorination step, UF, 1is
generated in the fluidized~bed reactor, passes through traps
NaF-1 and NaF-2 (maintained at 400°C to remove certain fission
products), and is collected on trap NaF-3 (maintained at 100 to
150°C). A fourth NaF trap (at room temperature) serves as a
backup for the NaF-3 trap. The gas flow continues to a fluorine
absorption tower containing 1/4-in. diameter activated alumina
spheres and then to the cave exhaust, During several experiments,
trap NaF-3 was heated to 400°C and the UF, was desorbed in a stream
of fluorine and then collected in cold traps cooled by dry ice.
The UF, was removed from the cold traps by hydrolysis with 20
vol % nitric acid,

Distribution of Fission Products Following Hydrochlorination Step

The activities found to be essentially nonvolatile during the
hydrochlorination step with the alloy fuels were cerium, cesium,
and ruthenium, Trace amounts of cerium and cesium found in the
condenser and scrubber following the runs with 5-yr-cooled
uranium-Zircaloy are believed to be due to entrainment in the
gas stream leaving the reactor and incomplete removal by the
packed-bed filter. Cerium and cesium activities were not detected
in the condenser or scrubber by gamma spectrometry following the
runs with short-cooled uranium-aluminum probablg because of the
masking effect of the large amounts of g5Zr and 29Nb present,

The activities that were slightly volatile during hydro-
chlorination were Sb, Mo, Tec, and Te, The amounts of these
activities that volatilized and were collected downstream of
the packed-bed filter ranged from about 0.3 to 10% of the charge
activity.

The activities that were predominantly volatile during hydro-
chlorination were Zr, Nb, Kr, and I. Some partition of zirconium
and niobium during hydrochlorination appears to occur from a con-
sideration of the large amount of niobium collected during fluorination.
An indication of the release of krypton during both process steps
was obtained by the use of a beta monitor located in the cave stack.

202

This monitor had been calibrated previously by releasing known
amounts of 85Kr to the cave atmosphere, The results of the measure-
ments made during the six hot runs showed that essentially 100%

of the available krypton is released to the stack during the
hydrochlorination step. During the fluorination, the activity

level in the stack returned to the normal background level.

Two runs were made with 3-month—-cooled fuel to follow radlo-
active 1311, 0f the iodine charged to the reactor, 66% was
collected in the scrubber following the HC1l step o{Bthe first
run and 93% in the second run. A trace amount of 11 was
found in the activated alumina following thelgiuorination step.
Stack-gas monitoring showed that <1% of the I was released
to the stack during both the HCl step and also during the
fluorination step. These results lead to the conclusion that the
bulk of the iodine i1s released during hydrochlorination and can
be removed efficiently by a caustic scrubber. A small amount
remained in the reactor following hydrochlorination.

Fission Product Distribution Following the Fluorination Step

The work with the irradiated fuels showed that only trace
quantities of cesium and cerium were found downstream of the
packed-bed filter. The bulk of the strontium charged was re-
covered with the reactor and filter beds.

Ruthenium., Ruthenium (Table IV) appears to be only slightly
volatile under the fluorination conditions. The amount volatilized
for the first four runs ranged from 0.2 to 0.6% of that charged
to the reactor. The small amount of ruthenium that did volatilize
was almost entirely collected by the 400°C NaF pellet traps.

Antimony. About 90% or more of the antimony remained in the
reactor bed following hydrochlorination, Most of this residue
was volatilized during the fluorination step and was almost
completely retained by the 400°C NaF trap. A small residue
(3 to 167%) remained in the reactor and filter beds following
fluorination.

Zirconium and Niobium. As noted, the bulk of the zirconium
and niobium was removed before fluorination during the hydro-
chlorination step, only 2 to 4% of the zirconium being downstream
of the packed-bed filter. This amount of activity, which must
pass through the packed-bed filter, raises a question as to whether
the zirconium is present as a particulate solid or as a gas. If
the vapor pressure of ZrF, in the gas leaving the reactor is ~47%
of i1ts saturation value at 550°C, sufficient 957r would be volatilized
to account for the zirconium activity collected by the 400°C NaF
trap. It appears likely that the zirconium movement is due to
volatilization; hence, its separation from volatile uranium hexa-

About 307% of the niobium volatilized during fluorination and
was collected by the 400°C NaF trap., The reactor-bed analysis
following fluorination showed that <1Z of the zirconium and niobium
remained, These two results suggest that a partition between
zirconium and niobium occurs during the HC1 step; i.e., a
smaller amount of the niocbium forms a volatile chloride. The
niobium that remains following chlorination readily forms a
volatile fluoride and is almost entirely removed during fluorina-
tion.

Technetium, Technetium closely follows uranium in the processing
steps. Only 3% of the technetium volatilized during the hydro-
chlorination step. Following fluorination, the bulk of the
technetium was collected with the UF, in the 100°C NaF traps.

Little or no technetium was removed grom the gas stream by the
400°C NaF trap.

Molybdenum. Less than 3% of the molybdenum was removed from
the fluidized-bed reactor during hydrochlorination., The work with
uranium~Zircaloy showed that the bulk of the molybdenum volatilized
during fluorination and was distributed largely between the 100°C
NaF trap and the 25°C NaF trap. Results of a run with uranium-
Zircaloy showed that about 20% of the molybdenum was trapped with
the uranium in the 100°C NaF trap. About 2% was collected with
the uranium when an additional desorption step was employed following
collection on 150°C NaF, About 12% was found in tfie reactor and
filter beds, indicating that the removal of molybdenum is not
complete under these processing conditions.

Tellurium., Less than 1% of the tellurium volatilized during
the hydrochlorination step. The bulk volatilized during fluo-—
rination, passed through the 400°C NaF, 100/150°C NaF, and
25°C NaF traps, and collected on the activated-alumina trap.
This trap was used principally to remove the excess fluorine
from the process off-gas before its discharge to the cave stacks.,
Stack-gas monitoring showed that only trace amounts of tellurium
were present, indicating that the alumina was highly efficient
for the removal of tellurium. Only small amounts of tellurium
collected with the uranium. About 0,14% of the tellurium was
collected with the uranium when a 100°C NaF trap was employed;
0.0016% was retained with the uranium when a desorption step
was employed.

Neptunium. Complete neptunium analyses were not performed,

but uranium-product analyses for the last two runs showed that
~21% of the neptunium charged was collected with the uranium,

Tests with Irradiated UQ, Fuels

The equipment used for the experiments with irradiated uranium
alloy fuels was modified by the addition of other traps and the
inetalla%19? of a sintered nickel filter in the fluidized bed
reactor.

In each experiment, 100 g of irradiated UO, (previously declad)
were added to a bed of refractory alumina in tﬁe fluidized-bed
reactor. The UQ, pellets were converted to U OB-PuO2 fines at
450°C in the fluzdized bed by reaction with Za Vol Z oxygen in
nitrogen. The sintered nickel filter prevented elutriation of
uranium oxides and bed material from the reactor. The process
off-gas passed through two traps containing activated charcoal

to remove any volatile products prior to discharge to the cave
exhaust.

In the uranium volatilization step, the uranium was separated
as UF, from plutonium and from most of the fission products by
the uge of BrF, as a selective fluorinating agent. The process
off-gas leaving the nickel filter contained UF6, Br,, BrF_, and
volatile fission-product fluorides in N, dilueht. 7he off-gas
was.passed through the uranium cleanup %rap where a selective
sorbent, NaF at 400°C, was tested for decontamination capability.
The gases continued through three additional traps in series,
which removed the UF_., Br,, BrF_, and the remaining volatile
fiesion-product fluorides. The first of these three traps con-
tained activated alumina, which removed UF, and some fission~product
fluorides and reacted with excess BrF. to give free bromine. The
next trap, which contained soda lime at ~300°C, removed the bromine
and some fission-product fluorides. The last trap contained
activated alumina to remove moisture released by the soda lime.

In the last step, plutonium was volatilized from the fluidized
bed by fluorine and was collected as PuF, in the product cold
trap. The off-gas from the fluidized beg reactor first passed
through a precooler at 0°C where high-boiling fission-product
fluorides were collected. A cold-trap backup containing NaF
pellets at 350°C was used to remove trace quantities of PuF
passing through the cold trap. The fluorine in the off-gas was
removed by four traps in parallel containing activated alumina;
parallel arrangement allowed limiting the flow of fluorine
through each trap to 1 liter/min to avoid caking of trap
contents. The off-gas cleanup trap following the fluorine-
removal traps was filled with NaF pellets at “400°C to remove
trace amounts of volatile fission products.

For three experiments in which other plutonium decontamination

schemes were examined, the PuF, collected in the cold trap was
sublimed at 0°C and transporteg in a nitrogen stream to additiomal

206

traps where the PuF, was either adsorbed by NaF pellets at 350°C
or thermally decomposed to PuF4 in beds of refractory alumina at
300°cC,

The Distribution of Actinides and Fission Products

The ranges of values for the volatile products collectdd during
the five runs are shown in Table V, The results of the runs ghow
the following:

1. The principal activities that volatilize during the
oxidation step (for fuel cooled 1 year or more) are krypton and
ruthenium; <27% of the total krypton and <3.3% of the ruthenium
charged were volatilized., Small amounts of ruthenium and tellurium,
well below the recommended limiting concentrations, were found #n
the process off-gas discharged to the atmosphere. No attempt
was made to trap krypton, and its discharge to the atmosphere was
safely accomplished by dilution with 2000 cfm cell ventilation
alr,

2. Up to ~13% of the total beta and gamma activity was
volatilized with the uranium during the BrF. step. The principal
gamma actlvity that accompanied the uranium was ruthenium., In
addition, up to 76% of the molybdenum, 2.7% of the antimony,
0.24% of the zirconium, and 1.9% of the niobium were also vola-
tilized with the uranium. Analyses to determine the amounts
of tellurium, technetium, and neptunium were not completed.

More than 99.5% of the uranium and an average of <0.5%
of the plutonium volatilized during the BrF_ step. Other workers (18)
have shown that even less plutonium (0%) may be expected to
volatilize during this step., Up to 87% of the krypton accounted
for was released to the process off-gas during this step. Small
amounts of ruthenium and tellurium, well below the recommended
limiting concentrations, were also found in the stack gas.

3. During volatilization of plutonium with fluorine, up
to v2% of the gross beta-gamma activity was transported con-
currently. The principal gamma activity transported was
ruthenium (3 to 14%), and up to 38% of the molybdenum and small
amounts of zirconium (<0,21%), niobium (<5.8%), and antimony
(<1.2%) were also volatilized. Analyses for other possible
contaminanta such as tellurium, technetium, and neptunium were
not completed.

A small amount of krypton was found in the off-gas during
the fluorine step of three of the five runs, suggesting that a
small residue of uranium oxide remidined in the reactor after
the BrF. step. The largest value for the krypton release was
9.6%. in addition to a small amount of ruthenium (<0.01%),

a variable amount of tellurium (up to 40% of that charged) was
found in the process off-gas.

The results of this work can be summarized as follows:

1, The presence of fission products and a radiation field
was shown to have little or no important effect upon product
recovery from the fluidized bed of alumina.

2, In general, the distribution of the actinides and fission
elements was found to be in accordance with expected distributions
based upon the volatilities of the compounds formed. In some
important instances, as exemplified by ruthenium, assignment of
the compound formed is difficult since the experimental evidence
suggests that more than one compound may be involved.

3. The uranium decontamination levels for the metal alloy
fuels were high enough-that the preponderant gamma activity was
due to the uranium isotope U. Gross decontamination from
gamma activity was 510/ and that from beta activity was >100,

4., Plutonium decontamination levels from gamma activity of up

to 3200 were achieved for the oxide fuel studies. The preponderant
contaminant was shown to be ruthenium.

ABSTRACT

Plutonium-bearing fuel materials were processed in an engineering-
scale alpha facility as part of a program aimed at advancing the
applicability of fluoride volatility methods to processing light-
water-reactor fuels. A successful program of fluidized-bed fluorin-
ation and thermal-decomposition studies was carried out on non-
irradiated UO,-Pu0, pellet materials and PuF, powder charges in a
study of key steps of flowsheets of current Interest. Overall,
kilogram quantities of plutonium hexafluoride were produced,
transported, and collected satisfactorily. The results of the
work are expected to find application in developing recovery
processes for high-plutonium materials such as fast-breeder-
reactor fuels and plutonium scrap materials.

INTRODUCTION

Development work conducted in an engineering-scale alpha facility(l)
on fluidized-bed fluoride volatility processes for the recovery of
uranium and plutonium from spent uranium dioxide fuels 1s described.
The program of studies was directed primarily at developing a flow-
sheet for processing light water reactor (LWR) fuel typified by
low-enrichment UOQ, pellets clad in Zircaloy. The results, however,
have more far-reaching significance, being pertinent to reprocessing
schemes (2) for high-plutonium liquid metal fast breeder reactor
(LMFBR) fuels and plutonium scrap recovery processes 3) as well,

Two flowsheets for LWR fuels have received major attentien to
date: an all-fluorine flowsheet(4) and an interhalogen flowsheet. (3)
Both have similar processing sequences: decladding with anhydrous
HC1l, fluorination of uranium and plutonium to their respective
hexafluorides, separation of uranium from plutonium, purification
of the hexafluorides, and finally, reconversion to the oxides.
Extensive use is made of flulidized beds, taking full advantage of
their excellent heat-transfer and solids-mobility characteristies.
Both schemes have as goals high (99%) recovery of uranium and
plutonium. The major difference between them i1s in the method of
fluorinating the actinides, The interhalogen flowsheet uses BrF5
as a selective fluorinating agent for the uranium, followed by
fluorine for separate recovery of the plutonium, In the all-
fluorine scheme, a partial separation of the uranium from the
plutonium can be effected by appropriate choice of fluorination
conditions (temperature and reagent concentration); generally higher
temperatures and high fluorine concentrations are used to recover
the plutonium.

The major emphasis of work in the alpha facility was on the
fluorination of plutonium-bearing fuel materials, demonstrating
the feasibility of producing and transporting practical quantities
of PuF,. Nonirradiated materials were used in all cases., Ex-
periments were conducted on several aspects of the process:

l. Two-zone oxidation-fluorination of U0,-0.5 wt % Pu0
pellets contalning simulated fission product oxides.

2. Thermal decomposition as a means of separating plutonium
as PuF, from UF _-PuF_, mixtures produced in the two-zone
oxidation-fluorination studies; decontamination from
selected volatile fission products was also examined
in these studies,

3. Fluorination of plutonium-containing materials remaining
after oxidation and interhalogen (BrF_) reactions on
Uo0,-0.5 wt % PuO2 pellets containing Simulated fission
product oxides,

212

4, Fluorination of PuF4 powder in campaign-type experiments.

Each set of experiments is discussed separately in the above
order. Also, gsets 1 and 2 are treated as a unit in a discussion
on material balances and the recovery of residual quantities of
Plutonium from the equipment by a cleanup fluorination treatment.
Experimental sets 1, 2, and 3 are described in detail in Reference
6; set 4 is described in Reference 7.

The alpha facility comprises two large alpha boxes for the
containment of plutonium, one containing process equipment and
the other containing equipment for scrubbing and filtration of
ventilation air and process exhaust gases. The process equipment
in the large alpha box, shown schematically in Figure 1, includes
a fluidized-bed fluorinator for fluorinating mixed-oxide fuel to
UF, and PuF_, a converter reactor for converting PuF, to PuF by
thermal decomposition, and a system of condensers ang chemical
traps for collecting hexafluoride products. A 200-point data
logger system was used to collect and process operating data.

The fluidized-bed fluorinator has a 3-in., dia., 4-ft tall
reaction section and is about 9 ft tall overall, with a disengaging
section that expands to 15 in., and sintered-metal filters located
above the bed. The fluorinator and associated process items are
of nickel.

The fluidized-bed thermal decomposer consists of a 2-in. dia.,
2-ft tall reaction section topped by a 4-in. dia., 2-ft tall cooling
and filtering section, all of Inconel, Both sintered Inconel and
nickel filters were used in this unit.

Both fluidized-bed reactors have inverted-cone bottoms with a
single inlet at the apex for gas entrance, Solids were batch-
charged through a top opening, in the case of the fluorinator,
and through a side opening near the top, in the case of the
thermal decomposer. Solids were generally removed from the bottom
in both cases.

TWO-ZONE OXIDATION-FLUORINATION STUDIES

These studies simulated the primary actinide recovery step of
the all-fluorine flowsheet. Batches of synthetic oxide fuel
pellets were processed to a UF_ -PuF, product; the hexafluorides
were collected in cold traps and then vapor-transferred to pro-
duct receivers. The fluorination equipment, except for the product
receivers, is shown in Figure 2. Information on rates of UF
production and extent of removal of plutonium from the alumina bed
and valuable operating experience were obtained in this first series
of experiments on plutonium-containing materials.

Each charge consisted of 8.8 kg of U0,-0.5 wt % Pu0, as 1/2-in.
by 1/2-in. right-cylinder pellets containing some 19 f%ssion product
oxides to correspond to 10,000 MWd/ton fuel. About 6.5 kg of
alumina (Alcoa Tabular T-61, nominal 48-100 mesh) comprised the
bed, which was reused for this set of three experiments.

In effecting the recovery of the uranium and plutonium, the
fluidized-bed fluorinator was operated first with two reaction
zones and then with a single reaction zone. Initially, the pellets
reside in the alumina bed in the lower portion of the reactor in
the packed fluidized-bed mode. (8) The alumina was fluidized in
the voids of the pellet bed, but also extended about 2 ft above
the pellet zone, providing a second fluidized bed reaction zome,

Oxidative pulverization of the pellets was effected in the lower
zone at a temperature of 400-450°C with about 207 oxygen in nitrogen.
Fluorine was admitted continuously via a side inlet to the zone above
the pellets as the fluorlnating agent for the U 0 —PuO fines, which,
were carried up from the pellet zone by the gas s%ream and the mixing
action of the alumina. About 10% fluorine was used during the two-
zone operating period with the fluorination zone at 450°C., Under
these conditions, the bulk of the uranium was converted to UF_,
while the plutonium was mainly converted to PuF,. Thermal conduc~-
tivity cells were used to monitor the fluorine concentration in the
off-gas., 9)  Continuous welght readout of the cold traps provided
a monitor of the UF6 production rate.

After about 85% of the pellets were reacted, the operating mode
was changed to single reaction zone operation by admitting the
fluorine at the bottom of the reactor; oxygen flow was stopped at
this point. Also, the gas flow that had been on a once-through
basis was now put on recycle to conserve fluorine. The fluorine
concentration was gradually increased to 80-90%, and the bed
temperature was gradually raised to 550°C and maintained there
for a given period (3 to 5 hr) to complete the recovery of the
plutonium.

Results and Discussion of Two-~Zone Oxidation~Fluorination Studies,
Success of these experiments was judged primarily upon the complete-
ness with which the plutonium was removed from the alumina bed.

The extent of removal was determined by analysis of grab and final
bed samples. Analytical data on plutonium content of grab samples
for the three experiments are plotted in Figure 3 as a function of
the duration of the plutonium fluorination period (designated
Fluorination Cleanup Period).

Residuval levels of plutonium equivalent to a maximum loss of
about 1% were desired. This loss level was essentially achieved
by using a single alumina bed for the three experiments, whereas
the loss for a single use of the bed was perhaps as much as 5%.
Percentage loss, of course, was a function of throughput, so the

above results should be considered preliminary.

High (near 100%) uranium removal was susgained in each experiment.
Peak UF, production rates to 110 1b/(br)(ft“) were noted; average
productgon rates for the three experiments were 41, 51, and 24 1b/
(hr)(ftz). Corresponding average fluorine utilization values were
55, 66, and 26%. Data indicated fluorine utilization might be
optimized by automatic control of reagents, which should be implemented
in future studiles.

Elutriation of some plutonium (most likely as PuF,) from the bed
by the fluidizing gas and subsequent deposition and ﬁoldup of this
material in the upper regions of the column were experienced. Nor-
mal blowback of the filters and mechanical vibration by a pneumat-
ically operated hammer was not completely effective in returning
this material to the bed during the run. When the gas flow was
stopped, however, at the end of a run, a portion of this material
did fall back into the bed and gave higher values for plutonium
content than did final grab samples. Caution must, therefore, be
exercised in evaluating results of a given experiment. This holdup,
of course, does not represent a loss but,rather, inventory that is
recoverable by a cleanup-fluorination procedure, as was demonstrated
later (see below).

Subsequent experience indicated that the quantity of material
retained in the upper part of the reactor reached a steady-state
value and was probably a function of column design (relative surface
area and geometry of these surfaces). This is a factor to be con-
sidered in the design of new equipment. In the present system,
holdup was on the order of 10-20 g of plutonium, In these initial
experiments, even the lowest value represented a very significant
fraction of a single charge; thus yield could not be used in
evaluating the results., In later experiments, with 600 g of
plutonium, this amount was a negligible percentage, and PuF6
production was an important parameter.

These initial studies also provided some.insight into prefluorination
requirements for experimental systems. It was concluded that inter-
action between PuF, and nickel surfaces still occurred even after
a vigorous prefluorination treatment with fluorine and accounted
for a part of the PuF, holdup in the cold traps and other parts
of the nickel equipment train, This holdup, on the order of grams
of material, was recoverable by the cleanup-fluorination treatment,

A pretreatment with CIF, was also used in two experiments,
particularly to remove adsdrbed moisture that might have entered
the system when the reactor was opened to the air during charging.
This would not be a problem with continuously operated units,

218

THERMAL-DECOMPOSITION STUDIES

Thermal decomposition provides a means to separate PuF, from
UF _-PuF, mixtures, e,g., as an intermediate step in an all-fluorine
flowsheet, or a means to effect some degree of purification of a
PuF_ stream from volatile fluoride fission products or other im-
purgties that are more stable than PuF,. On the basis of laboratory
work performed by Trevorrow,(lo) thermal decomposition requires the
appropriate combination of residence time for the gas and a tem-
perature that favors the formation of PuF, in the absence of
significant quantities of fluorine, consiﬁering the equilibrium
PuF, 2 PuF, + F,.

A fluidized-bed concept was selected for this study since the bed
provides a large surface on which the reaction can occur, and
isothermal conditions can be maintained for evaluation of the effect
of temperature.

The 10-kg batches of UF_-PuF, produced in the two~zone-reactor
fluorination studies serveg as ?eed for these decomposition studies.
Because of the low plutonium yield in the fluorination experiments,
additional PuF, was spiked into the final batch of mixed hexa-
fluoride feed go make a total of about 30 g of plutonium for the
three experiments. Some volatile ruthenium and molybdenum fluoride
species (speculated to be RuF_ and MoF,) were present in this
material and provided preliminary information on fission product
behavior in this system.

A relatively fine (-100 mesh) alumina material was used as the
bed so that a low fluidization velocity could be used, maximizing
gas residence time. The 2-kg bed gave about a 12-in. depth (when
static), and with a superficial fluidization velocity of 0.15 ft/sec,
a nominal gas residence time of 10 sec was achieved., The feed was
heated to about 80°C and fed as a 40% hexafluoride-60% nitrogen
mixture, With the hexafluoride feed rate at about 20 g/min, a 10-kg
batch of feed was processed in about 8 hr. Experiments were con-
ducted at 350°C and 300°C,

Results and Discussion of Thermal Decomposition Studies. The
extent of separation of plutonium from the feed was determined from
data obtained by analysis of feed (liquid and vapor) hexafluoride
samples, bed samples, overhead grab (UF, product) gas samples, and
samples from the final UF, product receivers. Although there was
considerable scatter in a given set of UF, product samples, the
plutonium levels were always low enough to indicate that good
separation had been achieved. Separations efficiencies ranged
from 99.2 to 99.99%, indicating the feasibility of this fluidized-
bed separation technique,

Analysis of grab samples from the bed over the course of the
three experiments showed a gradual buildup of plutonium to about

219
1.46 wt %, The final bed, unexpectedly, also contained about 0,19 wt 7%
uranium, The reason for uranium deposition is uncertain; it may be

a result of reaction with "untreated (unfluorinated) sites' on bed
particle surfaces. Less uranium codeposition occurred at the lower
(300°C vs 350°C) bed temperature.

The deposition of PuF, appeared to occur preferentially on
the surface of the bed particles rather than in the gas phase. Thus,
after a short period, the bed simulated a PuF, bed. Assuming
appropriately sized PuF, could be obtained as a starting material
in an actual application, a readily transportable product is made,
The nature of the PuF4 coating on the alumina was not studied.

Encouraging decontamination data for ruthenium and molybdenum
were also obtained. Analysis of bed samples by a spark source mass
spectrometric method showed ruthenium values of 0.2 ppm. The
ruthenium throughput wag about 5 g £ 2,5 g, giving decontamination
factors in the range 10- to 104, An accounting of molybdenum gave
a decontamination factor of greater than 102, The data showed
23 g of molybdenum in the overhead UF, product and about 0.2 g in
the bed (the bed analysis showed <0.0i wt %, the limit of the
analytical method used). Further studies in this area are recommended.

MATERIAL BALANCES

To examine the disposition of plutonium in the equipment in the
work to this point, an attempt was made to account for the overall
quantity of plutonium introduced into the fluorinator and thermal
decomposer in the course of the above-described experiments,
Virtually all equipment exposed to PuF, was given a fluorination
cleanup treatment, which consisted of recirculating 907% fluorine at
about 300°C, Recovered PuF, was trapped on sodium fluoride, which
is regarded as being 100% egficient as a sorbent for PuF,. Sodium
fluoride traps were placed in such a way that the amount of plutonium
recovered from a given section of the equipment train could be
determined. TFor example, one trap was placed just downstream of
the fluorinator; other traps were used downstream of each of the
main cold traps. Lines and product receivers were treated similarly.

The NaF used for sorption of PuF, was in the form of 1/8-in.
by 1/8-in. right cylinders, Follcwgng PuF, recovery, the trap
contents were ground individually, the resulting powder riffled
to split out a representative sample, and these samples analyzed
for plutonium content. The residual deposits of plutonium in the
equipment were found to be distributed as follows:

l, Small (vl g or less) quantities of plutonium were deposited

in the lines and secondary filter between the fluorinator and the
cold traps;

220

2, several-gram quantities of plutonium were deposited in
product receivers and on the primary fluorinator filters (a part
of the interim holdup discussed earlier); and

3. decagram quantities of plutonium were deposited in the cold
traps.

Mechanisms for deposition include radiation decomposition (v1-2%
per day in the condensed phase), thermal decomposition, and reaction
with nickel and other surfaces and with minor constituents of the
system (e.g., a number of fission products were in the oxide pellets),

Overall, a material balance of 887 was obtained for this initial
series of experiments, assuming the input pellets were approximately
0.5 wt % Pu0, as indicated by the manufacturer. Some question re-
mained as to the reliability of this input value, Nevertheless,
the initial purpose of this program had been fulfilled in that
operation of pilot-scale fluoride volatility systems with plutonium
materials was shown to be feasible, Insight into the behavior
of PuF, in these systems was gained such that more definitive ex-
periments might be planned.

STUDIES SIMULATING THE PLUTONIUM RECOVERY STEP
OF THE INTERHALOGEN FLOWSHEET

The interhalogen flowsheet proposes oxidation of oxide-pellet
fuel to U,0,-Pu0, fines, followed by separate fluorination of the
uranium and plutonium to hexafluorides, using first BrF_ as a
selective fluorinating agent for the uranium, then fluctine to
recover the plutonium. The reactions would be conducted sequentially
in a single reactor.

A brief program of plutonium fluorination studies was carried
out to simulate the plutonium fluorination step of this flowsheet.
Four experiments were made using 135-g charges of fine PuF, powder
(-325 mesh) and fresh alumina beds. Two experiments involved PuF,-
fission product residues in alumina, which remained after oxidation
and BrF_ steps were conducted on 650-g charges of UQ,-Pu0,-fission
product pellets in the laboratory fluidized-bed unit” (see”paper by
M. Steindler, this volume); oxidation had been carried out for 4 hr
at 450°C with about 20% oxygen (in nitrogen); uranium fluorination
had been carried out at 300°C for 2 hr with about 10% BrF, (in
nitrogen). About 20 g of plutonium and about 10 g of uranium
remained in the bed to be processed, following fluorination, in
each of these two cases.

Yield data on the production of PuF, was obtained in two ways:
by direct sorption on NaF and by direcg weight of PuF_., 1In the

latter case,the PuF, was initially collected in the large primary
traps and then vapor-transferred to a smaller cold trap that could

221
be weighed accurately. The small cold trap also had a NaF trap as
a backup.

Portable neutron survey meters (BF, type) were positioned at
the PuF, collection points and providéd information on the accumulation
of PuF, as a function of time and temperature. Starting fluorination
temperatures were 200°C and 300°C, but the temperatures were programmed
to increase to 550°C (with 25°C incremental changes) in response to
the data provided by the neutron monitors. The characteristic re~
sponse of the neutron monitor was an increase in count rate
immediately following a rise in temperature, followed by a pla-
teauing of the count rate, The temperature was raised after pla-
teauing was observed.

Grab and final bed samples were also taken to follow the removal
of plutonium from the alumina.

Results of Interhalogen Flowsheet-Related Studies. Plutonium
removal from alumina to residual values of 0.005 wt Z and
0.015 wt % in the bed was achieved in the PuF, and interhalogen
residue experiments, respectively. Both values were satisfactory
from an overall process standpoint, the former being equivalent
to 99.7% removal and thelatter being equivalent to 98.7% removal.
In the case of the latter, a total of some 75 g of plutonium had
been processed using a single alumina bed. In general, somewhat
greater retention of plutonium has been experienced when compounds
of fission product elements were present, although the exact re-
tention mechanism is not understood.

Residual uranium levels were very low, 0.003 wt 7, equivalent to
99.97%Z removal.

Yield results on PuF, were consistently good, up to 99%, in
the present seriles of experiments, indicating production and
transport of PuF, was feasible, The later series of campaign~type
experiments (see below) conclusively demonstrated this,

Poor agreement between analytical data on bed grab samples
taken early in a run and the expected values on the basis of known
charges of plutonium was again evidence of the problem of elutriation
and served to emphasize the point that greater attention must be
given to mixing characteristics of fine materials and relatively
coarse (48-100 mesh) alumina. Effects of these operating variables
on overall reactor efficiency needs further study.

FLUORINATION OF KILOGRAM QUANTITIES OF PuF,
A very significant series of campaign~type experiments were next

performed, which firmly established the feasibility of producing
and transporting PuF6 in engineering-scale equipment and collecting

222

it quantitatively. Information on the rates of fluorination of PuF4
from an alumina bed for scale-up purposes was also obtained.

Three campaigns were conducted. Each campaign consisted of three
successive experiments in which PuF, was fluorinated to PuF, with
fluorine, followed by a cleanup-fluorination experiment, which in-
cluded fluorination of the primary filter region and a separate
cleanup of the lines and other equipment (secondary filter section
and cold traps) to recover PuF, deposited as a result of alpha decom-
position of PuF, (or other interaction mechanisms). A single bed
consisting of agout 6500 g of 48-100 mesh prefluorinated alumina
was used in each campaign.

The effect of the starting temperature of the fluorination on plu-
tonium behavior, i.e.,g, retention by alumina and overall recovery,
was investigated. Starting temperatures were 300, 375, and 450°C
in the three successive campaigns.

Each experiment involved the fluorination of 200 g of plutonium
(charged as -325 mesh PuF4). Thus, almost 2 kg of plutonium was
involved in this program, compared with a total of about 600 g of
plutonium used in some 15 experiments up to this time. The restric-
tion of 200 g of plutonium per run was self-imposed because of the
direct connection of the large glovebox to a mon-critically-safe
aqueous scrubber. More specifically, only 200 g of plutonium, as
PuF,, was to be contained in a single vessel, whereas up to 2000 g
of plutonium in nonvolatile forms was allowed. For long range work,
use of fixed or soluble poisons, boron Raschig rings or boron in
solution should be considered in making the scrubber critically
safe,

The procedure for each experiment was as follows: The bed was
brought to the starting temperature while fluidized with nitrogen;
the gas stream was then put on total recycle, and fluorine flow was
started at a rate equivalent to about 207 of the total gas flow
rate. This quantity of gas was bled off at the same rate to main-
tain the system pressure constant. The ratic of fluorine flow rate
to nitrogen (purge and filter blowback gas) flow rate was such that
a steady-state fluorine concentration of about 85%Z was attained.

In each experiment the temperature was increased incrementally,

25°C every 15 min, until the final temperature of 550°C was reached,
The total time for fluorination was 5 hr for each experiment in
Campaigns 1 and 2. The fluorination time was reduced to 3 hr

in each experiment of Campaign 3.

The PuF, was collected in the two in-series cold traps used
in the eariier experiments. The cold traps were operated at about
-65°C, The PuF, was subsequently transferred with an inert-gas
purge to NaF sorption traps. In two instances during high PuF
production periods, the PuF, was trapped directly on NaF to obgain
information on fluorine uti?ization and production rates and to

223
determine how close to equilibrium the system was operating.,

Samples from these NaF traps and from the alumina beds provided

the basis for analysis of the experiments.

Separate cleanup fluor-

inations (2 hr of fluorination with fluorine at 300°C) were conducted
on the primary fluorinator filters and remaining process equipment
(cold traps, lines, secondary filter), and the amount and location

of plutonium deposits in the equipment were determined.

This

information was useful not only for material balance purposes but
also for studying the basic question of plutonium holdup as a

function of plutonium throughput.

If the plutonium is recoverable,

this interim holdup does not represent a process loss, but merely
reflects the need for an additional operating period for cleanup.

Results and Discussion of PuF, Campaign-Type Experiments.,

Very

encouraging results were obtained, as may be seen in the summary

of data presented in Table 1,
plutonium in the three final alumina beds,

The low residual concentrations of

0.010, 0.029, and

0.022 wt %, represent a total loss of only about 0.25% of the

plutonium charged.

The reduction in run time from 5 hr in Campaigns

1 and 2 to 3 hr in Campaign 3 had no adverse effect on plutonium

removal from alumina,

time compared with the amount of PuFg that could be produced at
equilibrium (PuF, + ¥, z PuFg); the change in fluorine require-
ment with temperature was considered in this calculationm.

224

The reduced operating time gave overall higher average PuF
production rates, and fluorine utilization efficiencies were gigher
in the third campaign than in the earlier campaigns. The improve-
ment was also directly related to the amount of plutonium in the
fluidized bed at a given time as shown in Table 2. For example,
during the first half-hour of Run 2 of Campaign 3, the average
quantity of plutonium in the bed was 204 g, and a fluorine
efficiency of 98% was achieved. During the next half-hour, the
average plutonium content was only 154 g, and the efficiency
dropped to 51%. As the plutcnium content diminished during the
final two hours, a further significant drop in efficiency occurred.
It is likely that similar characteristics prevailed during the
final period of the earlier 5~hr runs, The higher efficiencies
and PuF_ production rates observed in Run 2 of Campaign 3 over
those achieved in Run 1 also reflect the effect of plutonium content,
the second run having started with a fresh charge of PuF, plus a
heel of PuF4 from the first run equivalent to about 1/6 of a charge.

Fluorine §fficiencies near 100% and production rates up toc 6.5 1b
PuF6/(hr)(ft ) were obtained in the initial period of the second
run. These data were obtained by collecting the PuF, directly on
NaF traps and changing traps at 30-min intervals. Tﬁe observed
high production rate is not a limit and further improvement in
production rate could have been realized by starting with a high
concentration of fluorine in the fluidizing gas; in the current
procedure, the fluorine concentration is gradually increased from
0 to 95% in the course of gas recycle, Higher rates could also
probably have been achieved by operating at a higher initial
fluorination temperature, and by passing more fluorine through
the bed by increasing the gas velocity and the fluorinator pressure.
These results emphasize the benefits that might be realized by a
continuous process, in which the required steady-state concentration
of plutonium would be maintained to give a sustained high production
rate for PuF,. This was the concept considered in the design con—
cept study(29 for reprocessing IMFBR fuels,

The material balance values, 97-101% (Table 1), lie within the
range expected on the basis of a statistical sampling experiment.
Sample treatment included milling (coarse grinding in a disk mill),
sample splitting by riffling, and fine grinding steps, followed by
chemical analysis. Gross sampling error proved to be about T4%.

A complete plutonium material balance for one of the campaigns
(Campaign 2) is presented in Table 3. These data show that about
99% of the PuF, charge was fluorinated to PuF, and collected in
the two cold traps during the main fluorination period. The cold
traps were quite efficient at the current cperating temperature of
about =-65°C, Since the small loss (0.7%) sustained is about
equivalent to the quantity represented by vapor-pressure consider-
ations alone increased efficiency may only be achieved by operating
at lower temperatures.

The problem of holdup of plutonium on the primary filters appears
to diminish with increased plutonium throughput., The fraction re-
tained on the filters during Campaign 2, 0.7% of the charge, was
rather insignificant in terms of the quantity of material processed.
In earlier studies with plutonium charges ranging from 20 to 100 g,
filter holdup represented as much as 15% of the charge. Holdup, of
course, is a function of total available filter area and is responsive
to the filter blowback system.

The recovery of material retained on filters is dependent on the
ability to expose the filters to concentrated fluorine at 300°C
(conditions required for cleanup). Examination of the filters
after a total exposure at 300°C of about 30 hr disclosed no obvious
deterioration. Much more testing will be needed, however, before
conclusions about filter life can be made.

The only nonrecoverable loss is probably represented by the quan-
tity of plutonium retained by the alumina bed, about 2 g or 0.3% of

227
the charged plutonium. This value represents the loss sustained
when the bed is used in only one campaign, Losses may be further
reduced by using the same bed for several campaigns, if this
technique is feasible in practice, Studies, to date, do not indicate
the exact nature of the retention mechanism; this remains a subject
of interest for future study.

EXPERIENCE WITH NEUTRON COUNTERS AS PLUTONIUM MONITORS

The use of neutron counting equipment was explcited rather widely
in plutonium monitoring applications in the current program. Stan-
dard neutron survey instruments with either 2.5-in. long or 10-in.
long BF., prcbes were mounted at strategic locations (cold traps and
NaF traps) and coupled to scalers and recording instruments to record
the movement of PuF, from the reactor to the cold traps during fluor- .
ination and from thé cold traps to the NaF traps during PuF, transfer
operations. Operating procedures, such as tbe time-temperature pro-
gram used in the fluorination experiments, were selected on the basis
of the data obtained during PuF, collection in the cold traps.
Similarly, the decision tc reduce the fluorination pericd from
5 to 3 hr was based on these data,

Neutron response curves obtained during the first fluorination
experiment of Campaign 3, which were typical of the curves cbtained
in all three campaigns, are shown in Fig. 4., Figure 4a shows PuF6
sorption on NaF (Trap 1) during the first 3 hr of this experiment.
The cbserved change in activity level during the first hour was in
response to the collection of 86 g of plutonium. During the second
and third hours, the PuF, was fed directly to the cold traps. As
seen by the plateauirng in Fig. 4b, fluorination was essentially com-
plete after the secend hour. The transfer of PuF, out of the cold
trap and the corresponding sorption of this material ontc NaF (Trap
2) is shown in Fig. 4c. Approximately 74 g of plutonium was trans-—
ferred in about 1 hr.

Use cf these instruments for more quantitative measurements is
limited, in large part, by equipment geometry. In addition, above
about 40°C, these detecters are sensitive to temperature, Neverthe-
less, their value has been proved, and further efforts to extend
their use tec more quartitative applications appear to be warranted.

CONCLUSTONS

Fluidized-bed fluorination studies on sintered UOQ,-Pu0, pellet
materials and PuF,-alumina mixtures established the %easigility of
processing plutonium-bearing materials by fluoride volatility
methods. Overall, some 3.5 kg of PuF, was produced, transported
and recovered from the engineering-scale process equipment.
Fluorination rates for both uranium and plutonium were shown to

228
be practical, and fluorination efficiencies high using recycle
fluorination techniques, Neutron survey meters proved useful as
plutonium monitors in the collection and transfer of PuF6.

Thermal decomposition, using fluid-bed techniques, was shown to
be feasible as an efficient means of separating plutonium as PuF
from PuF6—UF mixtures. Some decontamination from selected fission
products thag form volatile fluorides, such as ruthenium and molybdenum,
was also demonstrated in this work. The method can be made continuous,
which is a process advantage,

The results of these studies are pertinent to the development
of reprocessing methods for light water reactor and fast breeder
reactor fuels as well as scrap recovery processes,

ABSTRACT

At the direction of the AEC, a high priority has been given
to a study to define the potential of fluoride volatility
reprocessing for application to fast breeder reactor fuels. To
provide the needed information, a conceptual design of a volatility
reprocessing plant has been prepared, together with an extensive
critique of the process. The study included the selection of a
process flowsheet, preliminary equipment design, rough plant lay-
out, and a discussion of the uncertainties associated with the
process. The results of the study indicate that fluoride volatility
processing of fast reactor fuels has significant potential advan-
tages, but that the development task may be as great as for other
potential methods of reprocessing.

INTRODUCTION

In order to make fast breeder reactors competitive with other
forms of energy generation, it is anticipated that fuel-cycle
costs of about 1/2 to 1 mill/kw hr will be required. To reduce
costs to this level, considerable improvement in all parts of the
fuel cycle--including reprocessing--will be required. Reprocessing
technology for fast breeder fuels might evolve through the develop-
ment of advanced aqueous processes or, alternatively, by the intro-
duction of new nonaqueous processes, To insure that a .suitable
reprocesgsing technology is available to achieve the long range
fuel cycle cost objectives, it seems prudent to investigate more
than one approach to the reprocessing of fast breeder fuels.

In 1968, the USAEC requested that Argonne National Laboratory
conduct a study to help define the potential of the fluoride
volatility process for application to liquid-metal-cooled fast
breeder reactor (IMFBR) fuels, The objectives of the study were
to present the current technological basis for a volatility proc-
essing plant in the form of process and engineering flowsheets
and to define process uncertainties. The uncertainties were
to be translated into key problem areas in order to provide insight
into the magnitude of the development task associated with estab-
lishing the volatility technology for ILMFBR fuels. Economic
estimates were not included in this study.

A conceptual design of a volatility reprocessing plant has
been prepared, together with an extensive analysis of the process.
In addition to process and engineering flowsheets, the study
includes preliminary design of major equipment items, and basic
layouts of the processing cells and the overall plant,

The ground rules for the study were set up in advance. The
conceptual reprocessing plant was to be a large central plant
serving nuclear power reactors with a total capacity of 15,000 MW(e).
The processing plant capacity corresponds roughly to a fuel load
of one ton per day. The plant would process core, axial blanket,
and radial blanket with a decontamination factor of 10° to 107/
and an overall minimum recovery of 99% of the uranium and plutonium.

The reference core fuel element was based on an Atomics
International preliminary design. Some of the characteristics
of this fuel design are given in Table 1. The specific power of
the core fuel was taken to be 200 MW(t)/metric ton and the burnup
100,000 MWd/metric ton. A fuel cooling time of 30 days before
processing was chosen to help provide low out=-of-reactor plutonium
inventory costs.

PROCESS FLOWSHEET

The process flowsheet was selected on the basis of existing
knowledge and conservative extrapolation for process steps not
clearly demonstrated. The choice of process steps rested on
their high potential for successful development. The flowsheet
was not optimized in any sense, A simplified version of the con~-
ceptual flowsheet is shown in Fig, 1, and some of the details
are shown in Figs. 2, 3, and 4.

The mechanical head-end scheme includes mechanical disassembly
of the fuel elements, chopping of the fuel pins, and a step to
separate the cladding and convert the oxide to a powder. The
homogeneous powder can be sampled for input accountability and
fuel burnup determinations. Details of the mechanical methed
for separating fuel and cladding segments are a little indefinite
at present, since only a limited amount of experimental data is
available on which to base this operation. One concept involves
tumbling the chopped fuel segments In a ball-mill to separate the
fuel powder, but other alternatives also appear possible,

The powdered fuel oxide is next fed along with powdered alumina
to the first of two in-series fluid-bed fluorination units, which
provide bulk separation of the uranium and plutonium as well as
partial decontamination. The bulk of the uranium is removed as
volatile UF, from the first reactor, and the bulk of the plutonium
is removed as volatile PuF, from the second reactor, a two-stage
unit. Continuous operation and staging appear feasible on the
basis of the current status of fluidization technology.

Fluorine gas is the only fluorinating agent used in the con-
ceptual process, Fluorination at 350°C with 20% fluorine-oxygen

in the first reactor converts the bulk of the uranium to UF6 and

less than 5% of the plutonium to PuF_,. The UF6 production rate is
approximately 100 1b/ (hr) (££2). Durgng fluorination with undiluted
fluorine gas at 500°C and 550°C in the upper and lower stages of 9
the second reactor, the PuF6 production rate is about 13 1b/(hr) (£t7).

The alumina stream, which cascades through the fluorination
reactors and finally to waste receivers, represents the main solid
waste stream, providing a vehicle for the disposal of those fission
products in the feed that do not form volatile fluorides,

The gas streams from each of the two fluid-bed fluorination
units pass through a fission product trap (partial condenser) and
a hexafluoride-collection cold trap, where separation from some
fission products occurs. The UF, product stream may contain
sufficient plutonium to warrant recovery of PuF, from this stream.
This 1s accomplished in the present flowsheet by recombining the
hexafluoride product steams and carrying out a more nearly quanti-
tative separation in a fluid-bed thermal decomposition step, where
PuF, is converted to solid PuF,. This step also gives further
pur?fication of the plutonium grom remaining volatile fission prod-
ucts, The UF, stream passes overhead and is purified by a com-

bination of fractional distillation and sorption traps.

The PuF, produced by thermal decomposition is subsequently
refluorinated to PuF, with concentrated fluorine (n100%) at
500°C and combined wgth the desired proportion of pure UF,. The
mixture is fed to a fluid-bed converter, where a dense homogeneous
Pu0,-U0, particulate solid is produced by simultaneous reaction of
the " hexafluorides with steam and hydrecgen. The conversion process
is based on work conducted earlier on UF, alone. Excess UF6 may
be converted to the oxide for use in other reactors.

PLANT DESIGN

The daily load of fuel to the plant is shown in Table 2.
Because of the short cooling time, the heat-load from fission
product decay is very large. It is assumed, therefore, that the
fuel will be transported to the reprocessing plant in sodium-filled
containers inside of shielded casks, or by some similar method
which allows for removal of heat during transport.

The removal of heat from the reaction vessels required very
careful consideration in the equipment design, Heat loads are
most severe in the main fluorination vessels, which have large
inventories of fission products, and particularly in the uranium
fluorinator, which has a large chemical heat load in addition.
Maximum heat fluxes are on the order of 11,000 Btu/hr £t2, and
calculations show that satisfactory heat removal can be achieved
with air cooling of a finned reactor surface, The slab design for
the fluorination vessel offers several advantages with regard to

the heat problem. It provides a greater surface for heat transfer
than would a cylindrical vessel of comparable volume and in addition
presents a small dimension across which the heat must be transferred.
Thus, in the event of a loss of fluidization in these vessels, heat
removal by conduction should avoid any serious consequences due

to high temperatures at the center of the vessel,

On the basis of known or estimated reaction rates and other
information, the equipment sizes for the conceptual plant were
calculated., The sizes of the major equipment items are shown in
Table 3.

Overall plant problems such as criticality, accountability,
and plant safety in the event of hexafluoride release have been
considered in this preliminary evaluation. The approach to
criticality control adopted for this volatility-plant concept is
one that avoids neutron moderation and minimizes neutron reflection
to obtain a low reactivity per unit mass of plutonium in the process
system, All vessels expected to contain significant quantities of
plutonium are of a slab design which lends itself to safe-by-shape
geometry, Preliminary criticality calculations indicate that 100 kg

of plutonium could be safely contained in a 4-in. thick slab
reactor of nickel, 48 in. wide containing PuF, at its theoretical
density (7 g/cc) and reflected top and bottom by alumina bed
material. The normal operating inventory in the present flowsheet
is below 50 kg of plutonium. Water is excluded from the process,
both internally and externally to preclude neutron moderation.

For both normal and credibly abnormal situations, an acceptable
factor of safety is predicted.

Accountability and burnup analyses are accomplished by sampling
the fuel before it 1s fed into the first chemical process stage
and by sampling the final waste streams (which establishes loss
levels)., Weights and analyses of the final products (the mixed
Pu0,-UQ, product of the conversion step) provide the remaining
neceéssary information for accountability.

Waste dispesal is accomplished by converting all wastes to
gsolid form. The principal high level wastes are: (1) the alumina
waste containing all of the nonvolatile fission products and (2)
the ruthenium-niobium pentafluoride from the partial condensers.
The alumina containing the nonvolatile fission products is discharged
to waste storage cylinders, Aluminum shot or coarse powder 1s added
to the waste as it is transferred to the storage cylinder to promote
the transfer of heat from the center of the cylinder to the walls
and thus lower the centerline temperature. These cylinders are
stored under water in a storage canal to permit partial decay of
fission products. The ruthenium-niobium fluorides collected in
the partial condensers are removed periodically by warming the
condenser and transferring the volatile fluorides in a gas stream
to a bed of sodium fluoride where the fission products are sorbed,
This NaF is then transferred to storage cylinders like those used
for the alumina waste. A total of about 200 cylinders are required
per yvear, each cylinder being 2 ft in diameter by 9 ft tall., Less
than half of these waste containers require interim storage for
decay of radioactivity to a level which will permit dry storage.

Considerable design and layout work would be needed to estimate
the size of the radiochemical processing cells and the total plant
with any appreciable degree of accuracy. This is beyond the scope
of the present study, which is only intended to determine process
feasibility. Nevertheless, a very preliminary layout of plant
equipment was made and from this, the processing cells and the
building appear to be of practical sizes., Remote maintenance was
selected for the most radioactive sections. Major repalr work
will be done in a separate maintenance area located in a sublevel
equipped with shielding windows and manipulators.

CONCLUSIONS

The application of fluoride volatility processing to IMFBR
fuels is supported by a substantial body of basic and technological
information, which has been generated in reprocessing development
work on other nuclear fuel materials and in various related
commercial processes. Among the most pertinent areas of earlier
work are: (1) commercial refining of uranium in the Allied
Chemical Corp. plant at Metropolis, Illinois; (2) extensive
development work on fluoride volatility processing of several
types of irradiated fuels; (3) basic and pilot (kilogram) scale
work on the preparation and transport of PuF_.; (4) plant-scale
experience with the fluid-bed calcination of radicactive waste
solutions at the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant; (5) the first
planned commercial ébplication of volatility processing to irradiated
fuels in the General Electric Midwest Fuel Recovery Plant.

The potential of fluoride volatility for processing IMFER fuels
may be measured by evaluating the feasibility of the process design
and reference plant concept developed in this study. The conceptual
plant has a practical size. Most of the steps of the conceptual
process have reasonably sound bases in current technology. The
techniques employed--continuous fluid-bed fluorination, hexafluoride
cold trapping, fracticnal distillation, and pneumz2tic-conveying of
solids--are basically the same as those used in the earlier work
cited above. It is in the extension of their use to highly radio-
active, high~plutonium fuel that uncertainty arises.

Our analysis of the conceptual process has defined several key
problems as follows:

1. Mechanical decladding of fuel involves difficulties from the
high rate of radicactive decay heat generation; also, it may be
difficult to insure that all fuel oxide has been removed from the
fuel hulls by the conceptual ball milling procedure; supplementary
cleanup of hulls may be required.

2. Continuous fluorimation will require the development of
reliable solids feeding devices and unique equipment such as slab-
shaped fluorinators and dual-stage reaction vessels., Plutonium
losses in the alumina waste from the fluorination steps must be
low,

3. Further development and testing is needed to insure that
plutonium decontamination will meet requirements.

4, The transport and handling of solid materials in a

processing plant operating with a high on-stream factor needs
development and verification,

239
5. Adequate containment of process wastes gases is an essential
requirement; this needs substantial study and development.

6. Further work is needed to insure that criticality safety
and containment of PuF6 will meet 2ll requirements.

7. The role of sodium (introduced into the process through
leaking fuel pins) and its potential effect on plutonium losses
will require additional study, since it is known that sodium
fluoride forms complexes with PuFe, causing plutonium to be
irreversibly sorbed.

Although these key problems have been defined by analysis of
the reference process selected for this study, the problems are
also representative of those existing in alternative flowsheets,
which were considered briefly. Solutions to these problems cannot
be considered simple; but none of them appears to be insoluble,
nor unduly complex when compared to similar problems for other
processing methods. Finding solutions to these key problems would
be the first stage of a development program on fluoride volatility.

We believe that the conceptual design study provided the
desired insight into the magnitude of the development task required
to establish the volatllity technology for LMFBR fuels. This
result, however, cannot easily be expressed in quantitative terms.
It is possible to state that an extensive development program would
undoubtedly be required, but it cannot be said that the magnitude
of the task would be either greater or smaller than that required
for development of any other method of reprocessing LMFBR fuels.

Abstract

Using the difference in vapor pressure between the chlorides of
uranium and those of fission products, a chlorination=-distillation
process of irradiated uranium dioxide fuel was investigated. Uranium
recovery and decontamination were poor on a single distillation.

After various improvements of the process, very high decontamination
was achieved by using barium chloride as a sorption-desorption medium
for the vapor of uranium chlorides, The most promising process was as
follows: Irradiated uranium dioxide pellets were pulverized through
an oxidation-reduction cyclic process and chlorinated by the mixed gas
of argon (60%) and carbon tetrachloride vapor (40%) at about 580°C.
The gas containing the vapor of the chlorides of uranium and some
fission products formed was passed through the barium chloride bed in
the temperature range from about 500° to 100°C, and the vapor of uran-
ium chlorides was sorbed on the bed. After the high vapor pressure
fission product chlorides which were sorbed with uranium chlorides
were preferentially desorbed by heating the bed to the temperatures

of about 460° to 480°C in the gas stream of argon (90%) and carbon
tetrachloride vapor (10%), the uranium chlorides were desorbed as the
vapor of higher uranium chlorides by heating the bed to the tempera-
tures of about 500° to 550°C in the mixed gas stream of argon (15%),
chlorine (70%) and carbon tetrachloride vapor (15%). The vapor was
trapped and uranium was recovered. After repeating the sorption-
desorption process twice or three times, it was possible to attain
decontamination factors to gamma emitters of 5.3x103 or 6,5x10%,
respectively, and uranium recovery of 96% or 94%, respectively, com-
pared to the single treatment value of 1,0x102 and 98%.

Introduction

The chloride volatility process has been applied to the pr?c§ss-
ing of irradiated nuclear fuel by some research groups. Gens ]
applied it to the processing of irradiated uranium dioxide fuel.
NaumanniZ2 applied it to the separation of uranium and plutonium

in the processing of irradiated uranium dioxide-plutonium dioxide
fuel, Speeckaert(3) was concerned about the application of the
chloride process to irradiated nuclear fuel, and applied it to the
processing of irradiated metallic and ceramic fuels.

The authors applied the process to separate uranium from irradi-
ated uranium dioxi?ﬁ gﬁing carbon tetrachloride vapor as the
chlorination agent\7™®/ | and experimented on decontamination of
uranium chlorides by a sorption-desorption process on a barium
chloride bed,

Preliminary Test

The major components formed by chlorinating U0y with CCly vapor
are UClL, UCls and UClg, and the quantity of UClg and UClg increases
as the chlorination temperature rises. However, UClg and UCIg are
relatively unstable, particularly UCl5. They rapidly decompose to
UCly and Cly by cooling in an atmosphere which does not contain
free chlorine gas. They are formed by heating UCT4 in an atmos-
phere containing large quantities of free chlorine gas.

This behavior was applied to decontaminate uranium chlorides.
The vapor of the chlorides of uranium formed by chlorinating unir-
radiated U0y powder in a gas stream of Ar-CCly vapor were passed
through a bed of anhydrous CaClp, SrCl2 or BaCl2. Then, sorbed
uranium chlorides were desorbed as higher chloride vapors by
heating in a gas stream of Ar-Cla-CCly,

Experimental results are given in Table 1. BaCly is evidently
the most promising.

Experimental

Materials

Uranium Dioxide = Uranium dioxide powder in sizes from 5 to 10un
was used for unirradiated samples. The irradiated samples used
were uranium dioxide pellets of 7.5 mm both in diameter and in
height. They were irradiated to an integrated thermal neutron flux
of about 1x1018 n/cm2 in the Japan Research Reactor-2, After
letting the activity decay for a period of about 200 days or 400
days, they were chemically pulverized by oxidation (400°C, with air)-
reduction (800°C, with hydrogen gas) cyclic process. The sample
used in one run ranged in weight between 0.05 and 0.5 gm,

Barium Chloride - The BaCly consisted of anhydrous granules
screened in four sizes of =W+5, 546, =6+7 and =-7+10 mesh with
Tyler sieves. The void fraction of the BaClz fiiled in a reaction
tube was about 50%.

Sodium Chloride - The NaCl was coarse powder of reagent grade.

Gases - Reagent grade carbon tetrachloride and market grade
chlorine gas were used. Argon gas was used for dilution of the
CCly vapor and for sweeping of the gas in a reaction tube assembly.
Air and hydrogen were used respectively for oxidation and reduction
of the UDy pellets. Trace oxygen which remained in the argon or
hydrogen was removed by passing through copper gauze heated to
about 400°C, and dried through a silica-gel column.

Apparatus

The experimental apparatus shown in Fig. | consists of a tubular
furnace, which is 35 mm in internal diameter and 450 mm in length,
and several reaction tubes. The furnace is of horizontal type and
electrically heated by nichrome wire. The temperature in the
furnace is controlled automatically. All the reaction tubes were
made of transparent quartz glass and their dimensions are given in
Table 2.

243
In the case of unirradiated samples, the desorption of uranium
chlorides was carried out by heating the BaClz bed to the tempera-
tures of L0O0C to 580°C in the mixed gas stream of 15% Ar-70% Clo-
15% cCly, vapor with the flow rate of 300 cc/min at 25°C. The
desorbed chlorides were sorbed on the NaCl! bed in the tube L4-B.
Then, uranium in each reaction tube was analyzed chemically.

In the case of irradiated samples, the desorption of chlorides
of fission products was carried out by heating to the temperatures
of 450° to 550°C in the mixed gas stream of 60% Ar-40% CCly vapor or
90% Ar=10% CCly vapor with the flow rate of 95 cc/min. at 25°C, and
the desorbed chlorides of fission products and uranium were sorbed .
on the NaCl bed in the reaction tube 4-B, The fission products and
uranium in the reaction tube 4-B were analyzed radiochemically or
chemically. The desorption of the sorbed uranium chlorides was
carried out in the mixed gas stream of 15% Ar-70% Ci2-15% CCly.

Results

Sorption of Uranium Chlorides

Effects of Gas Flow Rate and Chlorination Temperature - Granular
BaCly of -b6+7 mesh size was used. Chlorination-gas flow rates of
80 to 110 cc/min. at 25°C, and various chlorination temperatures were
investigated, From the results obtained the optimum temperature and
gas flow rate were determined to be 580°C and 95 cc/min. respectively.

Effect of Size of Granular BaCly - With a fixed gas flow rate of
95 cc/min experiments were conducted with BaClp granules of -4+5
-5+6, -6+7 and =7+10 mesh. With -4+5 and -5+6 mesh granules and a
chlorination temperature of 540 to 620°C the uranium chlorides sorbed .
on the granules extending from the hot zone to the colder region where
the temperature was about 170°C. wWith -6+7 and -7+10 mesh granules
and a chlorination temperature of 540 to 580°C the uranium chlorides
were all adsorbed on a much narrower region of the bed or on that
part of the bed which extended from the hot zone to the region where
the temperature was about 300°C,

Effect of Length of BaClo Bed - The effect of the length of the
BaCl, bed in the furnace on the distribution of the uranium chlorides
sorbed on the bed was investigated. The lengths used were 4, 5, 6, 7
and 8 cm, The chlorination temperature, the flow rate of the chlor-
ination gas at 25°C and the size of the granular BaClp were fixed to
580°C, 95 cc/min and -6+7 mesh, respectively.

Experimental results are shown in Fig. 2. With a 4 cm bed,
uranium chlorides condensed in the empty reaction tube 1-A where
the temperature was above AOOOC, which was the temperature of the
hot end of the BaCl, bed, However, this phenomenon was not observed

BaCl, : -6+7 mesh ; chlorination temperature : 580°C)
with a 5 cm bed, when the temperature of the hot end was about 440°C,
Thus, the highest condensation temperature of the vapor or uranium
chlorides in the reaction tube with no bed was estimated to be
between about 400°C and 440°C,

With 4, 5, and 6 cm beds the sorbed band of uranium chlorides
extended to regions of the bed where the temperature was below
170°C. With a 7 cm bed it extended to 170°C and with an 8 cm bed
it was limited to regions of the bed where the temperature was
3009C or above.

In the following experiments, the reaction tube 2, the chlorina-
tion temperature, the flow rate of the chlorination gas at 25°C and
the size of the granular BaCly were fixed to C, 580°C, 95 cc/min
and -6+7 mesh, respectively.

Desorption of Uranium Chlorides

Effect of Bed Temperature - Experimental results are shown in
Fig. 3. Good results were obtained when the bed temperature was
from 480° to 560°C. The effective temperature range when the reac-
tion time was one hour was slightly wider than when it was 30 minutes.

Effect of Reaction Time - The bed temperature was fixed to 500O
and 540°C, The desorption of the uranium chlorides reached 99% after
90 minutes reaction for 0.5 gm sample, and after 2 hours reaction for
1 gm sample. All the uranium chlorides were desorbed after 2 hours
reaction when the sample weight did not exceed 1 gm,

Sorption of Chlorides of Fission Products

Samples were allowed to decay for about 200 days after irradiation
before they were processed, Experimental results are shown in Fig. 4,
The nuclides degectable,as shown in the figure, were 95zr- Nb,

]03Ru, 106g,.10 Rh, 141ce and 1Hh4ce, Their percentages are given in
Table 3. All the chlorides of zirconium, niobium and ruthenium were
volatitized through the chlorination process and sorbed on the BaCl2
bed. Although most of the cerium chlorides remained in the boat
without volatilization, a small fraction of them was volatilized and
sorbed on the BaCly, The uranium chlorides formed were volatilized
and completely sorbed on the bed.

Desorption of Uranium Chlorides in the Mixed Gas Stream of Argon
and CCly Vapor

Attempts were made to desorb the chlorides of fission products
and not desorb the uranium chlorides in the mixed gas stream composed
of argon and CCly vapor, At first, the desorption of the uranium
chlorides sorbed on the BaCly bed was investigated in the mixed gas
stream, The desorption temperatures tried were 4502, 4709, 480°,
490°, 5109, 530° and 550°C, The flow rate of the desorption gas at
259C and the desorption time were fixed to 95 cc/min and 30 minutes,
respectively.

Experimental results are shown in Fig. 5. The highest temperature
where the uranium chlorides did not desorb varied slightly with the
concentration of CCl, vapor in the gas. The temperature was 490° and
480°C with 10 and #0& CCl, in the gas, respectively. The desorption
rate of uranium chlorides was increased linearly with the bed
temperature rising.

Desorption of chlorides of fission products

It was confirmed that the uranium chlorides sorbed on the BaCl2
bed were not desorbed in the mixed gas stream of 60% Ar-40% CCl
vapor or 90% Ar-10% CCl, vapor at temperatures of 480°C or below.
The desorption of the chlorides of fission products was investigated
under the same experimental conditions as the desorption of uranium
chlorides in the mixed gas stream of 90% Ar-10% CClh vapor.

Experimental results are given in Table 4. Retention ratio and
residual ratio of a nuclide A were respectively defined as follows:

As shown in Table 4, 99% of zirconium and niobium chlorides sorbed
were desorbed after %0 minutes reaction at 480°C. More than 70% of
ruthenium chlorides sorbed were retained on the bed. Cerium chlorides

Although data for the volatilization of 137¢s through the oxidation-

formed by chlorination was almost completely volatilized and sorbed
on the BaClp bed, and retained on the bed without desorption,

.
.
.
.

1t was confirmed from these results that zirconium and niobium
chlorides were almost perfectly desorbed, and ruthenium, cesium and
cerium chlorides were almost perfectly retained on the BaCl, bed
when the bed was maintained at the temperatures of L460° to 480°C
in the mixed gas stream of argon and CCly vapor.

The uranium chlorides sorbed were not desorbed through these
steps in the process.

Processing of Irradiated Uranium Dioxide

A flowsheet proposed on the basis of the experimental results is
reproduced as Fig. 6. Irradiated UQp pellets are pulverized through
the oxidation-reduction cyclic process and chlorinated by the mixed
gas of 60% Ar-40% CCly. The vapor of the chlorides formed is sorbed
on the BaCly bed., After the high vapor pressure chlorides of fission
products are preferentially desorbed by heating the bed to tempera-
tures of 460° to LBO®C in the mixed gas stream of 90% Ar-10% CCly
vapor, the uranium chlorides are desorbed as the vapor of UCTg5 and
UClg by heating the bed to temperatures of 500° to 550°C in the
mixed gas stream of 15% Ar-70% Cl,-15% CCly vapor,

About 1x10'8 n/cm2 irradiated and about 400 days decayed UO
pellets were processed according to the above mentioned scheme.
Longer decay time was adopted to study the behavior of 137¢s .

The effect of temperature on the preferential desorption of the
sorbed chlorides of fission products was investigated and is shown
in Fig. 7. The decontamination factor of Y-activity was gradually
increased as the temperature was raised from 350° to 460°C, and then
saturated, The zirconium and niobium chlorides which remained after
the preferential desorption were treated by the mixed gas stream of
Ar-Cl12-CCly vapor, desorbed and trapped with UCl5 and UClg. The
cesium chloride was also desorbed and trapped with the uranium
chliorides. The ruthenium and cerium chlorides were almost com-
pletely retained on the BaCly. These results are shown in Fig. 8.
The uranium recovéry was not affected by the desorption temperature
ranging from 350 to 480°C, The main Y-emitting fission product
remaining in the uranium was 137¢s,

Improvement of the decontamination was attained by repeating
the sorption-desorption process as given in Table 5. Corrected
decontamination factor in Table 5 means the decontamination factor
that was corrected by subtracting vy-activity of natural uranium from
Y-activity of untreated samples and that of recovered uranium. When

means that the Y-activity of recovered uranium was less than the VY-

that daughters of 235 and 238y were decontaminated and not yet

activity of uranium recovered were of the order of 102, 103 and 104
after repeating the sorption-desorption process once, twice and
three times, respectively. The uranium recovered was about 98, 96
and 94% after repeating the process once, twice and three times,
respectively.

Discussion

The equilibrium state diagraTsyf UCly~BaClg system has been
determined by Kuroda and Suzuki . In this system, the double
salt, Bapuclg (UC1y-2BaCip), is formed and the peritectic reaction
temperature is 583°C. The composition and the temperature of the
eutectic point of UCIL-BasUClg system are 58 mol % UCHy and 434°C,
respectively,

The vapor of uranium chlorides formed by chlorination in the
present experiment was passed through a BaClz bed with a tempera-
ture range from about 5009 to 100°C and cooled down. Higher uranium
chlorides are relatively unstable when the temperature is lower than
about 400°C and no free chlorine gas exists in the atmosphere. They
are decomposed into UCly and Cl,, and the UCly formed is sorbed on
the bed and BagUClg is formed. When the bed is heated in the gas
stream loaded with chlorine gas, UCI4 in the BajUClg reacts with
chlorine gas and UCl5 and/or UClg are formed and desorbed from the
bed as vapor,

The reason why uranium chlorides sorbed on the BaCl2 bed are
desorbed in the mixed gas of Ar-CCly vapor at temperatures above
4909C is explained as follows: The change, AF, in standard free
energy of formation of CCly vapor by the reaction

C(s) + 2C1(g) = cCly(g) (3)
is given by the equation

AF = =26,260 - 5.16TlogT + 49.32T cal/mol of CC14(9)(A)

where T means an absolute temperature,

When T = 762K, 489°%, AF = 0 in Eq. (4). Therefore, the quantity
of chlorine gas formed by decomposition of CCly vapor increases
rapidly at temperatures above 489°C. The lowest desorption temper-
ature of uranium chlorides in the mixed gas stream of Ar-CCly vapor
is 490°¢C and is nearly equal to the temperature 489°C. As the con-
centration of chlorine in the mixed gas increases at temperatures

257
above 490°c, lower uranium chlorides are expected to be chlorinated
to higher chlorides, and then desorbed from the bed.

Zirconium, niobium, ruthenium and cerium which form chlorides of
higher or lower vapor pressure than that of UClL are easily separated
from UCly, but cesium which forms a chloride whose vapor pressure
does not differ greatly from that of UCly is rather difficult to
separate. The vapor of CsCl combines with UCly on the BaCly bed and
forms a double salt. This is stable in the atmosphere containing no
free chlorine, and so CsCl is not desorbed in the mixed gas stream
of Ar-CCly vapor., The salt is unstable in the atmosphere containing
free chlorine, and CsCl is desorbed in the mixed gas stream of Ar-Cla-
CCly vapor. Thus, CsCl is not desorbed with the chlorides of zircon-
ium and niobium, And the double salt is decomposed through the
desorption process of uranium chlorides and CsCl is desorbed with
higher uranium chlorides.

Conclusions

On the basis of the experimental results and the discussion
mentioned above, following conclusions were obtained.

(1) By applying a sorption-desorption process with a BaCl,
sorption bed, the decontamination of fission products from uranium
was greatly improved.

(2) The optimum desorption conditions of the chlorides of the
fission products with high vapor pressure and uranium chlorides were
at the temperatures of about 460° to 480C in the mixed gas stream
of argon and CCly vapor, and at the temperatures of about 500° to
550°C in the mixed gas stream of argon, chlorine and CCly vapor,
respectively,

(3) The decontamination factor of Y-activity of uranium recovered
after repeating the sorption-desorption process once, twice and three
times were of the order of 102, 103 and 10 , respectively.

Introduction

Non-~quecus methods for reprocessing of irradiated nuclesr fuels
are under development in various lsborstarlies as economic alter-
natives to conventionel aqueous reprocessing methods, Of these,
flwride volstility processes are in advenced stage uf develvpment
for appl{qation to a variety of ursnium-based fuels used in power
resctors{~3/, An important category of nuclesr fuels i1s that
incorporating thorium either as metal, c%i%e‘ﬁg,carbm In threrme}
or fast breeder reactars operating on Th 32,033 fuel cycle., Re~
processing of such fuels by fluoride volatility methods is not
feasible because thorium fluoride is relutively non-volatile end
its sepsrvtion from other nen-volatile fission product fluorides ip
difficult, Other pyrocnemical methods also have not been extended
for application to thorium-based fuels,

Methods besed on the volatility cheracteristics of ursnium
chlorides have been explored triefly for their spplicatim to fuel
reprocessing. Laboratory investigstions on chlarination pro-
cessing of uranium diaxlde, \(xranisnn carbide snd Wo-Pud, fuel
materials have been reported L-11 Chlarination processes for the
recovery of urani\& and, thorium from graphite-bssed fuels hsve
been investigsted 3) These studtes have made uwse of e
voletility of urenium tetrachloride, thorium tetrachloride and to
g8 limited extent volatility of urani Smcacm.oride to effzgs. the
desired separation., Gens 6:11), Good\7?) and Warren Ferris have
studied the volatility of plutonium tetrachloride for the recovery
of plutonium in chlcaride volatility processes., These investi-
gations indicate that, inspite of the fast kinetics for the con-
version of plutonium trichloride to plutonium tetrachloride
vapour, the recovery of plutonium is difficult because of the large
quantity of chlorine required for the process, A complete fuel
reprocessing scheme explolting the volatility cheracteristics
of higher chlorides of uranium has not been reported.

Chlorinstion and hydrochlorination are employed as a head-end
step for the removal of cladding and structural materisls from many
of the wanium-based fuel systems prior to the applicati.ﬂ i§
fluoride volstility reprocessing to such fuel msterials\idsid)

In "Zircex Process" for reprocessing zircsloy clsd UC, fuels, a
hydrochlarination step is used {gs‘ de¢ladding prior to reprocessing
of the fuel by aqueous method sl « ouch headwend treatments

maeke use of the high volatility of chlorides of aluminium,
zlrconium end iron, at operating temperatures of practical interest.

Literature data on the stability and voletility of the chlarideb
of thorium, wsanium, protactinium, plutonium and fission products
indicated thet it should be possible to work out a chlor:l.nat.&a
volatility process for thorium-based and ursnium-based fuels ).

262

Feanibillty of such a.process was demonstrated Ly the present
laboratory scale investigations on Th0,~U0, and U0,-Pu0, type
fuel meterisls,

This paper describes, in brief, the results of the experimental
work carried out for the study. Hvest gation and the results

are reported in moare detall elsewhere

Chldarinstion volatility processing methode would be amenable to.
short covled resctor fuels with tonsequent—reduction in in-plent
fissile material inventory, es the processing reagents have low
susceptibilities to deleterious radiation damage. Criticality pro-
blems would also be less in the process owing to The ab¥ence of
neutron modersting envircrmants,A chlarination volatility mrocess,
in addition, would have the unique adventage of utilizing the same
process media-chlorine containing gas « for the head-end and re-
mocessing stages,

Process Chemistry

Actinide elements, rare earths and slkaline earth metals form the
most stable axides known, The free energy of farmation et 298%K
far a these cfl.des ranges between =120 and =140 kcael per grem atiom

axygen\17;83=23), {ery strong ahlorimsting sgemts tike csrbon
dioxide-carbon tetrachlaride or ¢hlorins - carbon tetrachloride gas
mixtures are required for the conversion of these oxides to chlerie
des, Also s temperature of 500 ~ 600°C 1is necesssry for chlori-
netion of ThO,, UUz and Puly at reasonsble rates, Under such condi.
tions it is expected that majority of the fission products present
in Jrradiated fuel would slso be converted to chlorides, As the
scheme visualises the use of voletility characteristics of higher
chlorides of uranium for the separation process, it is necessary that
the chlarinating gas be oxidising in nsture, This is achieved by
heving chlorine as one of the constituents of the chlorineting gas,
Under swch conditions the highest chlarides of the various
constituents, stable at chlarinating temperatures, would be expected
to be present, Large differences in the volatility of the vari.
ous chlorides formed can be the basis for a separstion procedure,

It is seen from the data in Tsble I that major fission products
may be divided into three distinct groups as regards the volatllitly

Among the sctinide chlorides of interest, PaClc is very volstile
ThClI* has intcrmediatc velatility and PuCl, cah be c¢lassified as

non-volatile.

The date indicate that wrehium can be separated

from 2 large number of fission products end from thorium in thorium-

based fusls and from plutonium in uranium-besed fucls,

The

gseparation can be achieved either by sirple distilletion procedures
or by the use of inert, high surface ares, packed bed filters at

high temperatures, which cen effectively retsin chloridcs of lower
volatility froam the vapor stream while allowing the highly volatile

chlorides to pass through,

The latter method, with refractory

alumine as filter medium, wss used in the precent investigetion,
By a proper selecticn of filter beds at tempersture gradient, it

would be possitle to separate ThCl

gecandary purification,

The possibility of a secondary purificetion of uwrsnium chlorides
by such simple physical methods is not indicated, because a number
of flssion product dhlarides and PaCl. have similar volatility
characteristics. Decrease in volatility of some of these chlorides,
either by reduction to lower chlorides or by formation of stable
binary compound® in some chemicelly ective sorption beds, could be
a possible separetion procedure, In the present investigation
it was found that chlorides of uranilem seect with sodium chloride
to form some stable binary compounds Uranium present in the
form of UC1 UUJ-Q vapors in the chlorinsting ges stream was quanti-
tatively reg- ined in a sodium chloride bed at 250-300°C, as &
sharp orange rad band, At lower (100 to 200°6)} and higher
(350 to 450°C) temperatures of sodium chloride bed, an increasing
smount of uwranium lesked out of the bed. The valency of uranium
in this orange red compound was found to be five by chemical
analysis 1s reported to form compounds of the type
CsUClg 6); ébably the sorption of uranium chloride proceeds
through the formeti onof NaUClg. In another series of experiments
where chlorination of U.On in presence of NaCl wes being tried it
was observed that no vozaeue species of ursnium are formed upto
$00°C inspite of the trighly chlorinating comdition., Uranium
formed a green compound with sodium chloride snd remeined in the
reaction zone. This compound must be UCl -2Na01 as rfggfted in the
urenium tetrachloride - sodium chloride p ase diagram Appa-~
rently the activity of UCL, in this compound is very low even at
temperstures as high as 600YC, It was decided to try to use these
data for separation of uranium from fission mroducts having
volstile chlarides,

Chlorination of U02...P\102 fuels is compliceted by the reaction
indicated by equation®(1)

PuCl (s) + 3 c1, (g) PuC1 (g) (1)

Accordi.ng to Benz(za) the equilibrium constant for this reaction
is given by equation (2)
log k = 6,18 - (670 - 1050°%K) (2)

The value of the equilibrium constant is apmroximately

5 x 10=° at 500°C. This means that 0,15 mg plutonium will be
carried as PuCl, by 1 mole of chlorine, It has been found that

the actual amou%t of plutonium carried while chlorinatin% us‘anium
oxide - plutonium oxide mixtures is more than this value

It is difficult to recover this part of plutonium and also it
contaminates the urenium fraction. To overcome this difficulty

it was decided to carry out the chlorinstion experiments et much lo-

wer temperature where PuClL is less stable, It is not possible

265
to chlorinate O, at satisfactary _reteswbe_lo(jg 5. however

U30 can be eas chlorinated even at 350° ’ . As UO -Ptﬂz

axidised to U308-Pu02 mixtures, it was decide? S.o work out &

Experimental Procedure

Materisls

Simulated ThOZ-ID fuel was prepared from coprecipitated
Th(IV) - U(IV% axeletes, Qxslates were ealcined to selid solution
oxides at 900°C and then pelletised and sintered in hydrogen st
1650° to 17009C. The pellets comtained 7.46 wt pot 0,. The
pellsts were crushed to powder and approximstely one gram sample
used for each experiment. U0, was prepared by oxidising sintered
U0, pellets at 450°C in air. ﬁuoz was obtained by calcination of
plutonium(IV) axslate at 500°C in"air. Aluminium oxide, which
wes used in this work as high temperature packed-bed filter
material, was granular 60 mesh type-RR refractory fused Al20..
Sodium chloride which was used a8 sorption bed for wsanium chlo-
rides was of snalytical grade sleved to + 52 mesh,

To study fission produgt behaviour, & sypical representative
mixture of fission product elements(immctive) wes prepared from
pure constituents either as oxide or chlorides.

Irr_al%iation of Th0..-U0, and U308 was carried out at a flux of
5 x 10 n/sec/cm toff thhows.

Apparatus

The apparatus consisted of a 35 mm Vycoar resction tube, 90 cm
long and was heated by a four-zone electric furnace., A demountable
sleeve tube febricated out of vycar and positloned suitably in
down flow line of the mein reaction tube conteined the filter beds
and the sorption bed. The arrangement permitted the isolation, ard
control of temperature, of the individual zones, A gas handling
manifold and a gas disposal set up completed the experimental
equipment. A schematic drawing of chlorination appsratus is shown
in Figure 1. For experiments with U,Ug-PuDp only a three zone
equipment was necessary. Alsc the ehtire sssembly, except the gaa
handling system, wes kept in a glove box.

Procedwre

The apparatus was assembled with alumine filter beds and sodiunm
chlaride sorption bed in the proper heating zones and then the
sample loeded into the system, The equipment was flushed with
No-Cl, stream at 600°C after which the temperatures of the various
zones were ad justed to decired values, Chlorination was then

Normal chlorination time was four hours, at the end of vhich the
epparatus wes cooled while pessing a stream of nitrogen, Various
zones were then analysed to determine degree of chlarination amd
separation factors. In experiments incorporating simulated fission
product meterials and those with irradiated solids, the fission
product snelysis was carried out by radiochemical seperations and
gamma spectrometry,

Results and Discussion

‘l‘hOZ-UOZ Process

A 012-001 <N, mixture in the ratio of 4111l was found to be an
efficient ciean chlorinating gas for the oxidic fuel materisls,
Complete chlorination of ThO,~UO0, was achleved at a temperature
700-750°C, On chlorinstion ThCl, and UC1le-UCl, vapours were

formed which volatilised out of é’he chlorgation zone, Tl';clk, fram
the gaseous stream, was filtered off by a refractory slumina
down-flow filter at 300-350°C, A protective alumina filter at
200°C prevented any mechsnical carry-over of ThCl, perticles with
urenium chloride gas stream, Uranium chloride vaPors were
quantitastively retained in the packed bed of sodium chleride held
at 250-300°C, Seperstion factors after this primary separation
procedure were 25 for uranium in thorium (Bed I, Al O3 filter bed)
end 5 x 10° for thorium in uranium (Bed III, NaCl sorption bed),

Fission product behaviour in the process wae invesiigated in a
series of experiments in which approximstely ten milligrams of si-
milzted fission product mixture (insctive), tagged with tracer acti-
vity, was chlorinated under conditiona described above, At a chlorie
nating temperature of 750°C, the chlarides of rare earths,Ba, Sr,ete.,
remained as residues in the sample boat, Cesium and ruthenium chlo-
rides were held up in Al0; filter bed at 300-350°C, 2rCl,, MoCl,
and NbCls passed through tge A120 filter beds at 300-350°C end
200-250°C, onto the sodium chloriée sorption bed at 250.300°C,

NbCl. and MoCl, were found to have very low retention in NaCl at
250~ 00°C. This indicates that compounds of, NbCls and MoCl, with
NaCl are not very steble at these temperatures, In the case ‘of Zr(Cl
it was found that while quantitative retention tekes place with the
sorption bed at 250°C, mo.e than helf of the ZrCl; leaks out ata
sorption bed temperature of 300°C. The vapor pressure )
of ZrCl over NaCl-NaZZrCl as measured by Korshunov and Gregory(29
is 0.0}l’mm at 300°C.” Assiming ideal trenspiration conditions,

this is necarly the value of vapor presswe calculated

from owr observations, Protagtinium behaviour was

checked by chlorination of P823302, precipitated with various
carriers such as Nb, Zr, Ce, Ih and U, under similar conditions.
With chlorination zone at 750°C, filter bed I at 350°C and

268

filter bed II at 250°C essentially all protsctinium trenspired

as PaCl,. onto the sorption zone and was quentitetively retained in
NaCl bed at 250°C to 300°C, This indicates that the compound
PaCl.. NaCl is also fairly stable at these temperatures. Decrease
in témperature of Al,0; filter beds I and II, to 300 °c and 200%C
respectively, resulted in a partial hold-up of PaClS in these beds,

Based on the above observations the experiments with irradiated
materials was carried out with chlorination zone at 750°C,

Mﬁ ter bed 1 at 350%C, A1,0, filter bed II at 250°C and the
8o chloride sorption bed at 2§O°C Over 99 pct thorium colle-
cted as crystalline ThCl, at the entrance of filter bed I. This
thorium had a gamme deconteminastion fector of 200. About 90 pct
uranium collected in sodium chloride sorpiiocn bf%ﬁ Urenium had appe
reclable gamme activity consisting mainly of Pa Decontamination
factors from selected fission products both for wranium and
thorium are given in Table II, The thorium and ursnium chlarides
separated in primery chlorinetion voletility process were subjected
Yo a second purificstion step to improve decontaminastion from fission
products end protactinium.

The second purification of thorium fraction was carried out by
distillation at 675 to 700°C in e stream of chlorinsting gss, The
¢e8 cont¥ining ThCl, was passed through two slwmina filter beds
kept a8t 700°C and 580°C. ThClh collected :T.rc\s filter bed at 500°C,
The distilletion zone and filter bed at 700°C were found to be
slightly sctive, whereas the exit zone had apprecisble activity.
The distilled ThCl, was practically inacti Ze and anslysis showed a
gross gamms decontémmaticn factor of 4x10%,

Seéondary purification procedures for urapium fraction aimed
at the formstion of UCL; .2NaCl from UCl;.NaCl. In one method,
this was done by passing hydrogen gas ag 500-600°C, Further chloy
rination of this bed with C15-CC1,-N, at 600°C resulted in the
removal of essentially e11 ZrCl éndzpacl , @nd the remeining

to uranium oxide by pyrohydrolyeis at’300°C end further axidation
at 500°C: The oxidised materisl was-rechlorinated using-the-ehlow
rinating gas at 500°C for 3 hours, Uranium oxide got converted
to UCl, «2NaCl whije ZrC]'I,,’ PaCl_, MoCl, and NbCl, were volatilized

The conceptusl flow sheet for reprocessing ThOo-UOC, type fuel
materials by direct chlorination voletility processing is given in
Figure 2. Adaptation of the scheme for other thorium based fuels
such as Th-U alloys, ThC,-UC, and dispersion of axide or carbide

hydrogen chloride during decladding to form ThCl, and UClg which
ere practieally non-volatile at temperstures t.ha% are commonly
employed for hydroechlorination, With ssrbide type fuels, a pre-
liminary axidation step to remove mstrix materials may be
advantageous,

U308-..Pu.02 Processing

Preliminsry experiments on the chilorination of U30 -rud, adopted
the optimised reaction conditions developed for U OB(QB). in
these, chlorinstion, filtration amd sorption zoneg were Kepb

at b,50°C, 300%C and 300°C respectively. Pure P\.ﬂz powder did not,
get chlorinated at 450°C. However in U0y sempleS having

0.08 wt pet PuC, essentially all plutonium got chlorinsted and the
volatile pluton%um species distributed betieen the Al,U, filter

bed and NaCl sorption bed. At & chlorination tarpera%u?e of

350°C, the amount of Pul, chlorinsted and transpired along with
urenium chlorides could be brought down appreclably, AlpOz filter
bed et 200°C was found to effectively decompose Pull; vapor to
PuCl, solid. There was a slight retention of uranium ir the filter
bed 8t this temperatwe but the decontamination factor or Pu in
uranium had very much improved and it was declded to stendardise

at this temperature. In experiments with U,0g = 1 wt pct Pub,,

U0 was campletely chlorinated in four hou?s and passed onto

Ngc?i sorption bed. Only 5% Pul, (on 10 mg basis) was converted

to PuCly and reacted with chlorine to form volatile Puclh, which
was efféctlvely retained in A1,0, filter bed, Only 4 to 5 mg

out of 10 mg of plutonium transpgred along with wranium chloride

Chlorination volatility processing of mixtures containing 1 to 17

increasing percegtage o? Pu0y, the amount of PW, converted to
PuC13 and treanspired onto Al O, bed as PuCl, decreased from L wb pect
to 035 wt pet. However separa ion factors for plutonium in wenium
did not improve,

In experiments with irradiated UBOS’ mixed with Pul,; and inactive

similsar to thst in ThO, -06 experiments, All fission productes except

The decontemination factors from individusl fission products
after primary end secondary pwification are 1isted in Teble III,

Recovery snd purification of plutonium fraction by chlorination
volatility was not tried, It is suggested that fluoride volatility
mrocedures be used for the recovery and purification of plutonium
residues, This step would be easier and practicel in view of the
fact that Pul, residues do not contein any significant quantitles of
wanium and fission products that form voletile fluorides,

The conceptual flow sheet for the direct chlorination volatility
processing of the low emrichment U0 -PuD type fuels is presented
in Figure 3. The scheme may not be appﬁcable to fuels with more
then 20 wt pet Pu0, because they cannot be oxidised to U308-Pu02

Conclusion

It is seen from Tables II and III that reasonsble decontamination
factors can be obtained by chlorination volatility processing of
irrsdiated fuels. It is expected that the deconteminstion factors
will improve in scaled=up experiments, It is suggeit that fluie
dised bed techniques be used for the entire process o Uslng a
colum of refractory alumina particles, a number of gas-solid
reactions of the type envisaged in the chlorination volatility pro-
cess can be carried out with proper process control. Such tech-
niques can be easily adapted in the case of UO,-Puw, fuels, as the
technology for the moderste temperstures involwved is already
existing, However in the case of ThO -UO type fuels, container
and process materiel development woul be necessary before the
scheme can be put into practice.

FROM THORIA-BASED FUEL ELEMENTS+)

Farbenfabriken Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Western Germany

Abstract

Laboratory studies have been made on the Fused-Sal+ Fluoride-
Volatility Process (FSFVP) appiied to thorium-uranium oxide or
carbide particles in a manner analogous to the application of FSFVP
to metaliic fuel elements. Systematic investigation of hydrofiuori-
nation and fluorination establlshed that the most favourable com=
position of the fused salt was LiF-Naf~Zrf4 = 25-25-50 mol/o. It
was also found that corrosion of the reactlon vessel (NI or Ni-rich
alloys) decreased with increasing ZrFs in the melt. Volatilisation
yletds ranged upto 99,8% even when ThF, was present as a precipi-
tate. In view of this high yield i+ should be possible to apply
this process to these oxide fuets provided further steps in the
process do not give rise to major difficulties,

introduction

This paper deals with work performed in a joint development
program carried out by several industrial firms In cooperation with
the Kernforschungsanlage JUlich. The object of this work is to inve-
stigate several possible methods of processing irradiated fuel elements
containig thorium, especially those of the AVR and THTR reactor of
the pebble bed type.

The fuel element contalins the fuel in the form of coated particles
uniformly distributed In a graphite matrix, with an inner fuel zone
of the eiement being enclosed by a fuel-free graphite zone. The
coated particles under investigation contain the fuel In the form
of carbides (UC2-ThC,) or oxides (U0»=ThO5).

Fundamentals .

The concept under discussion deals with +?e 2T+emp+, to apply the
known Fused=Salt Fluoride=Volatility Process 1=4) to thoria based
THTR fuel elements. This process, in the following cal led FSFVP for
simplicity, originated in the early fifties, when in the first instance
it was developed by the ANL for the recovery of enriched uranium
metal and uranium alloys on a laboratory scale. The introduction of
homogeneous molten sait reactors(®) {ed to an intensifled further
deve|lopment of this process culminating in a pilot plant at the
ORNL{®*8) 1n which several types of fuels with different cladding
and structural materiais could be processed successfully, A com-
plete core loading, processed by a non-~aqueous procedure, was demon=
strated for the firig t+ime In 1958/59 by the FSFVP at the Alrcraft-
Reactor-Experiment. )

In the FSFVP the fuel material is dissolved by hydrofluorination
in a fused fluoride bath for conversion from a solid to a liquid
state, The resulting melt is fluorinated with fluorine to voltatilise
the uranium as the hexafluoride, which is finally purified in an
adsorption-desorption step by use of NaF or by distillation.

The application of the FSFVP to ox{g? type fuels was demonstrated
only in the case of short-cooled U02( , and some experiments have
been performed to investigate the applicability to refr??Tory oxide
fuels containing BeO, ThOy or Zr0Op at laboratory scale! . But
nothing has been published about processing of thoria-based fuels
from THTR-type reactors with high thorium contents by a FSFVP.

Consequently the first problem of the applicability to oxide-
type THTR-fuels consists in the dissolution step, i.e. the conversion
of the oxides (UOp, Uz0g~ThOp) into the tetrafluorides in a salt melt.
The proposed head end process, consisting of the combustion of the
graphite balls, 1s used to generate the oxide mixture above. The
chosen salt meit must satisfy certain specifications: the conversion
must proceed at ftemperatures as low as possible, with an adequate

280
reaction rate, to diminish the corrosion probiem. The salt me!t must

exhibit at these temperatures a sufficiently high solubllity for the

tetrafluorides. Theserequirements must be investigated for every new

combination of fuel=-molten salt, in order to find the most favourable
conditions.

Hydrof luorination

I+ is known that the reaction of oxides with HF in fluoride melts
is on{& possible In the presence of acidic fluorides, e.q. BeFp or
ZrF4( ), This fact may be explained by metathesis. The oxyfluoride
mixture obtained in this way is apparently able to react quickly with
HF to form the tetrafluorides, in contrast to +he oxides:

ThO, + Zrf, + ThOF2 + ZrOF2
ThOF, + ZrOF, + 4 HF + ThF, + ZrF, + 2 H,0

Since zircontum=bsaring systems showed favourable properties In
relation to corrosion, Th? three component system LIF-NaF-ZrFg4, which
Is already we | 1=known (13 » was chosen for the investigation.

Diagram 1 shows this system leading to the following requirements:
if 5009 Is desired as a reaction temperature, salt compositions near
the equimolar point (LiF=-NaF~ZrFg=33=33-34 mol/o) should be chosen.
Raising the temperature to the range of about 550 to 600°C permits
sufficient freedom for the choice of +he compesition. The possibility
of working with these high temperatures is |imited by the possible
degree of corrosion,

The dissolution step for Th0,/UO, particles with the molar ratio
5/1 and 20/1 has been Investigated as a function of the following
parameters in the presence of HF:

1. ZrFg=content at constant temperature
2. temperature

and without applyina HF as a function of

3. ZrFg=content

Dlagram 2 shows the reactlion rate of ThO,/UOp-particles at 650°C
at different Zrfg-contents in the melt+. Each single diagram shows the
percentage of reacted material!l as a function of the reaction time for
definite ZrFg=contents, which have been increased from 3 to 47 mol/o.

All values have been obtained by analysis of small samples, which were
taken at definite (the plotted) times. 1t can be stated that the reaction
rate is increased with increasing ZrfFs-content in the met+t.

content. At 20 mol/o ZrF4 for example the reaction Is complete after
20 min, (Ratlo oxide/melt,10% g/q)

2. Influence of the temperature

The dissclution step was Investigated only at temperatures lower
than 650°C, corrosion being too heavy at higher temperatures. As can
be seen from dlagram 4, at the lowest possible temperature of 450°C
(ref. diagr. 1) the reaction rate is +too slow and the reaction in=
complete. 600 to 650°C will be necessary for this step, in order to
achieve a satisfactory rate of reaction.

3. Influence 6f ZrF4 without HF-application

As mentioned earlier, Zrf4 is able to react with ThO2/U0, resulting
in breakdown of the crystal lattice without application of HF, gene-
rating an oxyfluoride mixture.

Diagram 5 shows the results of this reaction type without use of
HF. The Time needed for complete destruction of the particles was
measured as a function of the Zrfg~content. The LiF-NaF molar ratlo
was kept constant during this series. Hence at 50 molar % ZrF, there
is a maximum rate. In order to study the influence of the LiF-NaF
molar ratio, a subsequent investigation was carried out, in which
this ratio was changed, keeping the ZrFag-content constant.

4, Influence of the LiF-NaF molar ratio

The results of this series of tests are given in diagram 6, which
makes it clear, that the fastest rate is achieved, when Lif and NaF
are present in equimolar proportions, thereby fixing the most con-
venient composition for the dissolution step:

LiF - NaF - ZrF4 = 25 = 25 = 50 mol/o

Simultaneously it was found that the following hydrofluorination
of these oxyfluorides to the tetrafluorides takes less time than
hydrofluorination of the oxide particles.

5. Solubility tests

The next important question is the solubility of the tetrafluorides
in the given melt, Tests concerning the solubility of ThFs in a melt
of the above mentioned composition iIndicate that the simpler three
component system NaF-ZrFs~ThFs, which has already been investigated,
may be used as shown In diagram 7(14) | Even at temperatures as high
as 650°C the solubility for ThF, Ts not very high. Approximately
5 molar % Thf, are soluble.

Schematic Drawing of the used Fluorination Equipment

Fiuorination = UF. = Volatilisation

From Information published by the ORNL!'3? there should be no
difficulty In votatilising the uranium with elementary fluorine if
+he uranium Is dissolved homogeneously in the melt,

Diagram 8 shows schematically the flowshest of the combined
fluortnation=hydrofluorination-equipment, which was used in this
investigation. As may be seen from the diagram, attempts were made to
carry out both reactions In the same reactor as a "single vessel”
reaction.

General procedure

For the investigation of the volatilisation rate of UFg, expressed
as the percentage of uranium volatiiised as a function of the fluori=-

nation time, the conditions have been standardised to enable comparison
to be made:

All serles of tests were performed with the same fluorination
equipment, consisting of crucibles of nickel or nickel=rich alloys
of the Hastelloy type, which had been Inserted into resl!stance heated
furnaces. The amount of the starting melt was 100 or 150 g, which
enabled a reaction to take place between 10 or 15 g Th02/U02 particles
and fluorine=nitrogen mixtures, as desired,

After ascertaining that the UFg-volatilisation itself did not cause
any major difficulties, the scale has been enlarged to a 3 kg fluori-
nator, which is capable of taking from 250 to 300 g of particles.
Later, experiments in a hot cell will be performed on this scale also,

Figure 9 shows a picture of the arrangement used on a labora-
tory scale, The fluorination reactor is shown together with the
absorption beds which were operated at 100 or LOOPC, respectively.
To improve the heterogeneous reaction of the gaseous fluorine with
the liquid melt it was agitated by means of a percolator tube
(draft tube), This construction is shown in & agram 10,

Results

The fluorination reaction Is influenced by the following parame-
ters:
1. geometry of the reactlion vessel and its fifttings
2. gas velocity
3. concentration of fluorine
4, presence of ThF,

Using the arrangement shown, it was found that the following
condi+ions will achieve good results: the ratio of length/diameter
of the crucible or the furnace which contalns the melt should be not
less than 4/1. In the case of a 150 g batch size this configuration

287
10.  Photograph of the Draft Tube

288

postulates a gas velocity of 12 |/h. The application of pure undiluted
fluorine is not necessary, since mixtures of fluorine with e.g. nitro-
gen can achieve comparably good results; but as it can be seen from
diagram 11, a dilution of the fluorine to less than 1/1 decreases the
volatilisation rate markedly.

Diagram 12 shows four typical volatillisation curves with different
ThF4=contents. The presence of ThFg does not influence the votlatili=
sation; but i+ Is remarkable that Thfq may be present additionallty
as a precipitate without appreciably decreasing the volatilisation
ylelds. Furthermore a common Induction pericd of about 40 to 60 min
can be observed before any UFg 1s volatilised at all, This could not
be detected in the absence of ThFg.

Other Process Varilants

In the experiments described so far, both single reactions "hydro=
fluorination" and "fluorination" were carried out in a salt melt,
Kal i=Chemie Hannover, another participant of the joint project,
studied possibilities for the conversion of the oxides into the tetra=
fluorides by reaction with HF in a fixed or fluldised bed reactor at
450°C, | f this step Is performed without a salt melt, the corrosion
in the FSFVP can possibly be diminished. The corrosion at the liquid=-
gas Interface is believed to be caused by the water generated after
the reaction of HF with the oxides.

Consequently there are 4 possible variants:

1. Hydrofluorination with subsequent fluorination In Zrf,-
bearing melts,

2. Reaction to the oxyfluorides without hydrofluorination In
ZrF4-bearing systems with subsequent fluorination.

3. Dry hydrofluorination leading to a UF4/U0pF,=ThF, mixture
which can be fused with alkalifluorides (LiF-NaF=ThFg) with
subsequent fluorination. (Proposed by Kali Chemle)

4. Fusing the UFy/UOxF,=ThF, mixture with a ZrFs=bsaring system
with subsequent fluorination.

Atl four possibilities have been investigated systematically,
especially concerning the corrosive properties, Considering these
variants, two main features can be pointed out:

ZrFs=bearing systems exhibit, in fact, only a limited solubility
for ThE4, but are on the other hand quite superior in relation to

the corrosive attack on the construction material, Hydrofluorinations
at 650°C in Zrfs-rich melts caused only a slight increase in the
nickel content of the melt.

ZrF4=-free systems allow appreciably greater amounts of ThF,, since

Volatilisation of UF6 in the Presence of ThF4

tolerable In connection with Intergranular attack.

Corroslon Studles

During the investigations into ZrFa-free systems (variant 3) a
severe corrosion was observed in contrast to the ZrFs-bearing systems
(variants 1, 2 and 4). The nickel content in the melt increased so
rapidly, that the viscosity became too high, thereby termlinating the
fluorination before all uranium had besn volatilised. These obser—
vations made it necessary to undertake a somewhat more systematic
corrosion study. But restrictively it must be stated that all results
reported here refer to the nickel content of the meit+ which was
analysed by direct X-ray excitation, and no work could be performed
using ultrasonic or vidigage techniques.

As is shown in dlagram 13, corrosion is uneqivocally influenced
by the ZrFg=-content ot the melt. This investigation is based on the
hydrofluorination step, and shows additionally that nickel=rich alloys
of the Hastelloy type exhibit a much higher resistivity to attack.

Corrosion during fluorination does not make the FSFVP unworkable,
but It Is necessary to use only melts with high ZrF,-contents In
order to avoid excessive corrosion, Whereas the amount of dissolved
nickel In ZrFs-free systems is Increased under the chosen conditions
(3 h,Fy at 550°C) by a factor of 30 fo 40, corrosion Is decreased to
such an extent, when Zrf, is added, that the factor will become only
1,5 0 2, proving thereby the superiority of the latter system.

Consequently it seems favourable to combine the "dry hydrofluori-
nation" with the UF.«volatllisation out of ZrFg-bearing melt systems,
since the volatilisation yields in a melt are higher than those ob-
tained by dry fluerination In a fixed or fluidised bed. Dry fluorination
is stilt under investigation by Kali=Chemie, who have found that UFg-
volatilisation yields can be increased by introducing an additional
intermediary step of pyrohydrolysis. The complete process of dry
fluorination would then consist of the following steps: hydrofluori-
nation, fluorination, pyrohydrolysis, hydrofluorination, fluorination,

Sorption Studies of UFg on NaF

It is known that a separation of UFg from some other volatile
ﬂssio? gr?ggcf fluorides can be accomp!ished by adsorptin-desorption
on NaF'1o= . 1509C had already pr?st +? be a feasible temperature
for the separation of MoFg from UFg ~20), Before beginning investi-
gations on the behaviour of MoFg, the sorption characteristics of UFg
on NaF pellets were determined. Taking the proposed 150°C as an
appropiate temperature for separation, in order to make further use
of this sorption technique, i+ can be said that the adsorption of
UFg, even at this temperature, is still quantitative. On the other
hand, it is impossible to desorb any UFg out of the complex Naz[UFs]

at this temperature. This leads to the conclusion that it should be
possible to separate both hexafluorides.

Studies in connectlion with the |lifetime of NaF-pellets from the
Harshaw Chem. Co. led to the result that this product can be used
at least ten times for clean, non=contaminated UF; in a cyclic process;
even after the tenth cycle the uranium remained f?xed In a small,
limited band.

Conclusion

By demonstrating that the first two main steps of the FSFVP, 1.e.
hydrofluorination and fluorination, do not cause any major difficulties,
it should be possible to apply this process to oxide type THTR-fuels
also, provided that the next step, the further decontamination of +the
volatilised UFg on NaF-beds, can be solved successfully. Furthermore,
there is another fact in favour of this process: the absence of
plutonium, since the fuel elements now under investigation contain
thorium as breed material and highly enriched uranium as fuel.

Abstract

A pyrochemical process has been developed for the recovery of
enriched uranium from residual crucible skulls that result from
the EBE-II melt refining process. The process involves: (1) oxi-
dation of the skulls to liberate them from the crucible as a
free-flowing powder; (2) addition of the powder to a halide salt
and extraction of 75 to 95%Z of the nobler fission product elements
from the oxide with liquid zinc at 800°C; (3) reduction of the
uranium oxide by contacting the salt with a Mg-17 at. % Zn alloy
at 800°C; (4) removal of 95% or more of the remaining fission
products by transferring away the molten salt and the metal alloy
in which the metallic uranium is insoluble; (5) dissolution of
the uranium in a Zn-29 at. % Mg alloy; and (6) recovery of the
uranium product by retorting and melting. The Skull Reclamation
Process was developed and tested on a pilot and a prototype
plant scale in the Chemical Engineering Division of Argonne
National Laboratory. However, a change in the EBR-II reactor
status from an experimental to a test reactor precluded the
installation of Skull Reclamation Process equipment in the
EBR-II Fuel Cycle Facility.

Introduction

The concept of on-site recovery and recycle of discharged
reactor fuel has been established in Argonne's EBR-II reactor
complex, Processing of spent reactor fuel and refabrication of
new fuel are carried out in the EBR-II Fuel Cycle Facility.(l
Fuel processing is carried out by remote pyrochemical methods. A
simplified fuel cycle flowsheet is shown in Figure 1.

Although the EBR-II reactor may ultimately employ plutonium
alloys, an enriched uranium alloy is now used as the fuel in the core
loading. The core is an assembly of 0.144 inch pins which are
clad with stainless steel and thermally bonded with sodium. A
process known as melt refining‘<: was developed and has been
used successfully for five years to recover EBR-~II fuel in the
Fuel Cycle Facility. A closed fuel cycle melt refining and
refabrication of fuel remotely has been successfully demonstrated.
However, because of the small scale of operation, continued
operation is not justifiable economically, and so recovery of
EBR-II fuel by pyrometallurgical methods in the Fuel Cycle
Facility was discontinued early in 1969.

In the melt-refining process the fuel pins are declad
mechanically, chopped to convenient lengths, and charged along
with makeup uranium to a lime-stabilized zirconia crucible. The
charge is melted, heated to 1400°C, held at this temperature for
about 3 hr, and then poured into a mold to form an ingot. This
treatment removes about two-thirds of the fission products through
volatilization of some fission elements and selective oxidation
of others by interaction with the zirconia crucible. The nobler
fission products such as molybdenum, ruthenium, and zirconium
are not removed by melt refining. The recycled fuel is an alloy
of uranium and "fissium".* To avoid an alloy of changing compo-
sition, inactive noble metals were alloyed with the initial fuel
in their approximate equilibrium concentrations based on an
auxiliary removal of about 77 of the noble metals during each cycle
for 2% burnup fuel. Experience has shown that the presence of
noble metals enhances the irradiation stability of uranium.

The product ingot is used to refabricate new fuel pins by
injection casting. The fuel pins are inserted into stainless
steel cans, welded, and assembled into new fuel subassemblies for
recharging to the EBR-II reactor. In the melt refining process,
inorganic, radiation-stable materials are used which permit
processing of short-cooled, high-burnup metal and ceramic fuels.

*Fissium is a name given to a variable mixture of fission product
elements (atomic number 40 to 46) which, when alloyed with
uranium, impart to the alloy desirable metallurgical properties
and radiation stability.

The rapid recycle of the fuel results in reduction of fuel
inventories outside of the reactor. Other advantages of the process
over an aqueous process are the small volumes resulting in compact
processing equipment, direct production of solid wastes, and the
elimination of criticality problems associated with aqueous
solutions.

When the product ingot is poured in the melt refining process,
about 7% of the uranium remains in the crucible as a skull which
consists of a mixture of dross and unpoured metal, In addition
to uranium, the skull contains about 7% of the original noble
metal content and nearly all of the more electropesitive fission
product metals, Ba, Sr, Y, and the rare earths.

A liquid metal process, called the Skull Reclamation Process,
was developed for processing the melt refining skulls. (%) This
process has three objectives: (1) recovery of the uranium,

(2) removal of the electropositive fission products, which have.
been concentrated in the skull, and (3) removal of noble and
refractory metal fission products which are not removed in the
melt refining process. Since about 93% of the fuel material is
recovered in the melt refining process, a recovery of about 95%

of the fuel in the melt refining skull will result in overall

fuel recovery of at least 99.5%. Decontamination requirements

are modest since in a fast reactor, neutron poisoning is minimal
and all fuel refabrication is done remotely behind heavy shielding.
It is necessary to remove only amounts sufficient to avoid excessive
dilution of the fuel. Fission product removals of 60 to 90% are
entirely adequate for this reactor.

A pyrochemical blanket process (as indicated in Figure 1) was
also developed. The basic equipment and operations are similar
to those employed in the Skull Reclamation Process and will not
be discussed further in this report.

In developing the Skull Reclamation Process flowsheet, equipment,
and techniques, a total of 36 skull-reclamation runs were made in
the pilot plant equipment and 18 runs were made in the prototype
plant equipment. During the develcpment period, changes were
made in the process to simplify the operations and reduce the
overall run time from 32 hr to about 11 hr, The final Skull
Reclamation Process flowsheet resulting from this work is
shown in Figure 2.

The primary steps in the process may be described briefly as
follows:

Skull Oxidation: The skull in the melt refining crucible is
burned at a controlled rate in an 0,-20% Ar atmosphere at 700°C.
The skull is converted into a free-flowing oxide powder which is
removed from the crucible and charged to the noble metal extraction

Noble Metal Extraction: This step 1s designed to separate the
relatively noble metal fission products from uranium. These
noble metals include mclybdenum, technecium, ruthenium, rhodium,
palladium, silver, indium, and antimony. To effect the desired
separation (at least 50% removal), the finely divided oxides
are suspended in a molten halide salt. The noble metals are
reduced by contacting the oxides with zinc, and the metals are
extracted into the zinc, which is then removed and discarded.

It is not essential that the reduced noble metal fission products
dissolve in the zinc phase. Some of these elements have very low
solubilities and it would be unrealistic to use sufficient zinc
to dissolve them completely., Mild agitation of the zinc phase
during transfer is sufficient to maintain in suspension those
elements whose solubility is exceeded.

Reduction: The reduction of U0, by liquid Mg-Zn alloy can be
represented by the following overa%l equation:

UOZ(salt) + 2Mg (Zn) + 2MgO(salt) + U+(Zn-Mg)

The uranium oxide, which is dispersed in the salt phase
(MgCl,-CaCl,-CaF,) as a solid, is reduced by the magnesium in
the metal phase., The MgO collects in the salt phase and the
uranium, which has a solubility of only 0.1 at. % in the Mg-
17 at. % Zn alloy at 700°C, precipitates from solutionm.

The experimental work of Knighton et 21{6) and Martin et a1(7)
showed that molten halide salts offer advantages in the reduction
of uranium oxides by molten metals. The salt promotes more
complete reductions and scavenges the MgO by-product of the
reaction away from the product in the metal phase.

The Mg-Zn and the salt containing rare earths, barium, strontium,
and zirconium are pressure-siphoned from the crucible and treated
as waste.

Uranium Product Dissolution: The uranium precipitate is
dissolved in a Zn-30 at. % Mg alloy at 810°C. The solubility
of uranium in this alloy at 800°C is about 4.0 at. %Z. However,
dissolutions are made with an excess of Zn-Mg alloy to provide
about a 3.0 at., % uranium solution.

Solvent Evaporation: The Zn-Mg-U product ingot is charged to
a beryllia crucible and subjected to a low-pressure retorting
operation (750°C, 1l0-micron pressure) to remove the magnesium
and zinc. The condensed magnesium-zinc vapors are discarded as
waste, and the uranium is consolidated into an ingot by heating
the crucible to about 1200°C. This ingot is suitable for recycle
to the melt refining operation.

Pilot Plant Equipment

The equipment used in the pilot plant studies consisted
essentially of two large bell-jar furnaces heated inductively and
containing tungsten processing crucibles. This equipment was
located inside a glovebox whose dimensions were about 13,3 ft
long by 8.5 ft high by 3.3 ft wide. A dry N,-Ar atmosphere was
maintained in the enclosure and in the furnaces to protect the
reagents against oxidation and moisture, Figure 3 shows the
glovebox, furnaces, and control panelboard before closure of the
glovebox with gloveport panels. A heated transfer line is shown
in position for transferring molten metal from one furnace to the
other. (Two furnaces were used in the early process flowsheets,
In the final flowsheet only one furnace was used and all transfers
were made to a waste or product receiver.) Transfers of molten
materials were made by pressurizing one of the furnaces with
argon, The bell jar covers had three nozzles, one of which was
used for an agitator shaft, the other two for insertion of transfer
tubes and other equipment used for sampling, liquid-level measure-
ment, and temperature measurement.

In addition to the bell jar itself, the service nozzles in the
top of the jar were water cooled to prevent damage to rubber
gaskets. The temperature of the rubber gaskets was 40°C when the
furnaces were at 800°C which is well below their permissible
operating temperature of 150°C., During the runs, a continuous
argon gas purge (5 cfh) into the three bell-jar nozzles inhibited
the accumulation of condensed metals and salt around the agitator
shaft, the sample port, and the transfer tube.

Tungigsn crucibles were used to contain the molten salts and
metals. Figure 4 shows a pressed-and-sintered tungsten
crucible (12 in. 0.D. x 20 in., high) with integral mixing baffles.
This is one of three such crucibles fabricated by Union Carbide
Nuclear Corporation, Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The density of the
crucible material is about 92 to 94% of theoretical, and the
weight of each crucible is about 500 1b. The crucible is shown
suspended from its lifting yoke. Below the crucible is the
graphite secondary container and susceptor, an insulating sleeve
and the flat strip copper induction coil. The coil was powered
by a 30 kW-10,000 Hz induction unit. Surface temperature of the
coil was about 300°C when the operating temperature of the
crucible was 900°C.

Two other tungsten crucibles of approximately the same size
were fabricated, one by arc-welding rolled tungsten sections, and
the other by shear forming. The welded crucible failed at the
bottom weld after three process runs. The shear-formed crucible
was not used in Skull Reclamation Process runs but gave excellent
service in other pyrochemical process studies using halide salts,
Cu-Mg-U alloys, Zn-Mg alloys, and zinc at temperatures up to 900°C.

Internal components of the furnace that required machining were
generally fabricated from Mo-30 wt %Z W alloy. These components
included the mixer shaft and blades, small heat shields for the
shaft bearing assembly and a large heat shield, which covered the
crucible. An additional heat shield made of Hastelloy-X was
located in the upper portion of the furnace bell jar.

Waste and product streams were removed from the tungsten
process crucilble through Mo-30 wt % W transfer tubes formed in
the shape of an inverted "J". 9)  The initial transfer tubes were
fabricated of 5/8 in. 0.D. by 5/16 in. I.D. gun-drilled Mo-30 wt % W
alloy rod, which was assembled by means of threaded elbows. Contin-
uous development resulted in an improved design: two lengths of
gun-drilled rod (3/4 in. 0.D., by 3/8 in. I.D.) were coupled together
to form a single tube 78 in. long. In place of threaded elbows,
the bends were made by hot-forming. The tube was heated to a .
temperature of 800°C by means of a number of 600-watt magnesia-
insulated, stainless-steel sheathed, 1/8 in, 0.D. heating cables,
which were wound on the tube. The heaters were covered with
insulation and then canned with a stainless steel enclosure. The
enclosure protected the insulation and heaters during handling,
and the annular space evacuated and filled with argon to prevent
oxidation of the Mo-30 wt 7Z W tube.

The material discharged from the process crucibles was collected
in a graphite mold suspended from a dial scale. This arrangement
permitted control over the quantity of material removed in any
transfer by close observation of the scale.

Prototype Plant Equipment

Prototype plant equipment for the Idaho EBR-II Fuel Cycle
Facility (FCF) was designed, fabricated, and tested at Argomne
National Laboratory by personnel of the Chemical Engineering
Division.

The equipment was operated in a large argon-atmosphere enclosure
equipped with gas purification and refrigeration systems. All
mechanical manipulations were carried out by use of a small crane
or by various hand tools operated through gloveports. These
operations were performed in a manner that simulated completely
remote operation in the FCF. Figure 5 shows the interior of the
enclosure as well as the furnaces used in the oxide reduction and
retorting steps.

The primary components of the skull-oxide processing equipment
are a skull-oxidation furnace, skull-oxide-reduction-and-purifi-
cation furnace, transfer tube, transfer receiver equipment, and
retorting furnace for recovery of the uranium product,

Figure 6 is a drawing of the skull oxidation furnace which was
developed aB Argonne and is installed in the EBR-II Fuel Cycle
Facility.(l ) An earlier version of that furnace was used in the
inert atmosphere enclosure to prepare skull oxides for the Skull
Reclamation Process studies with prototype plant equipment.

Figure 7 is a vertical section through the skull-oxide-reduction-
and-purification furnace. The furnace body is made of Hastelloy C
to withstand operating temperatures up to 900°C. The pressed-and-
sintered tungsten crucible was fabricated without internal baffles
but had a dished bottom to increase the mixing turbulence from the
offset agitator. A second impeller and a baffle cage were added
at a later date to enhance mixing intensity.

The agitator shaft was driven by a 3 hp D.C. motor at speeds
up to 1000 rpm through an open gear-and-pinion assembly. The
gears were lubricated with an adherent dressing of APL grease to
which molydisulfide powder had been added. The shaft seal con-
tained a special high-temperature molydisulfide lubricated packing.
A constant low-rate argon purge below the shaft seal prevented
entrance of fumes into the packing section.

The external resistance heaters (20 kW) were arranged to be
opened by pneumatic cylinders to increase the rate of cooling
should that prove desirable. The insulated cover as well as the
transfer tube, shaft seal assembly and charging port were all
sealed by fusible-metal seals. 11§

The heated transfer tube was constructed in a manner similar
to that used in the pilot plant equipment.(9) The bore was
larger (1/2 vs. 3/8 in. 1.D.) to increase capacity, and braided
heaters were used in place of swaged heaters to reduce the number
of heater circuits by permitting longer heater sections. Since
the transfer tube was designed for use in an inert atmosphere, a
sealed protective enclosure was not required. Construction
details are shown in Figure 8.

During the initial stages of equipment development a potential
operating difficulty was encountered with salt and metal fumes
that were released when materials were charged to or transferred
out of the hot furnace. Charging difficulties were resolved by
installing on the furnace a permanent hopper, which was closed
by a simple 4-in, ball valve. The transfer receiver (which is
mounted on a platform scale to indicate the quantity of material
transferred) was placed in an enclosure from which the fumes were
exhausted through a filter chamber containing high-temperature
AEC filters.

As shown in Figure 2, the uranium resulting from the oxide-
reduction-and-purification step is removed from the furnace by
dissolution in a magnesium-zinc alloy which is cast into an ingot.
The final step in the Skull Reclamation Process is the recovery
of the uranium from a Zn-29 at. %, Mg-3 at. % U ingot by
evaporating the Zn—Mg.(lz) This operation is carried out in a
compact combination still pot, condenser and collector shown in
Figure 9. The assembly is located inside a bell-jar furnace to
permit operation under low pressure (V10 torr). The still pot
is heated inductively with about 7.5 kW power output from a
10,000 Hz generator. A thixotropically-cast beryllia crucible
with interior hemispherical bottom is used to contain the metals
during the retorting operation. A graphite secondary container is
used to support the beryllia crucible and acts as an induction-
heating susceptor.

Proper performance of the equipment requires close control of
power input to avoid surging or bumping. The furnace was equipped
with a seismic vibration detector and a contact microphone to warn
of the approach of excessive boilup.

Pilot Plant Operating Experience

Mechanical Performance. In developing the process some changes
were made in the skull-oxide processing flowsheet shown in Figure 2.
These changes were primarily in the relative quantities of reagents
used. Operating conditions employed in the final pilot plant
runs are shown in Figure 10.

Mechanical performance of the equipment was generally satis-
factory. The pressed—-and-sintered tungsten crucible and the
Mo-30 wt % W agitator shaft and impeller showed excellent corrosion
resistance. The improved design of the heated transfer line gave
excellent service in conjunction with techniques for close control
of solution-transfer operations. The transfer line was fixed in
the furnace with its inlet point about 1/2 in. above the crucible
bottom. All transfers were made by pressurizing the furnace with
argon. When relatively complete transfers were desired, e.g.,
transfer of salt and magnesium-zinc after the reduction step or
transfer of uranium product solution, the furnace was kept
pressurized until excess argon pressure vented through the empty
transfer line. In such cases approximately 95% of the available
molten material was transferred. When only the metal phase was
to be transferred e.g., the zinc phase following the noble-metal-
extraction step, the metal transfer was initiated by pressurizing
the furnace. When the desired amount of metal had been removed
(as indicated by the weight of the receiver), the gas pressure
was vented through a relief valve and the transfer abruptly
stopped. These transfers were controlled at 90% removal of the
zinc to avoid inadvertent transfer of the molten salt in which

The presence of moisture in the salt constituted a major problem
during the early development phases of the process. The salt
is highly hygroscopic and absorbs moisture from even a relatively
dry atmosphere (e.g., 750 ppm water). Reaction of this moisture
with molten magnesium results in evolution of hydrogen, which
can cause the molten salt to foam out of the crucible. This
difficulty was resolved by pretreating the salt before it was used
in the furnace. Pretreatment consisted of melting the salt and
contacting it with a molten Mg-Ca alloy. The Mg0 and Ca0 formed
as a result of reaction with moisture in the salt was removed by
hot filtration. The dry inert atmosphere in the glovebox prevented
absorption of water during subsequent operations.

Fission-Product Removal

Ruthenium and molybdenum are soluble in the noble-metal zinc
extract to about 0.33 at. % and 0.15 at. %, respectively, at 700°C,
The waste zinc supernatant is transferred while the zinc is stirred
at a speed of about 100 rpm to suspend the molybdenum. Table I
shows fission product removals in four pilot plant runs made in
accordance with the flowsheet shown in Figure 10. The removal
of molybdenum varied between 19 and 33%. Ruthenium removals were
good and ranged from 75 to 85%. As noted in the table, zirconium
removal in the Mg-17 at. % Zn supernatant after the uranium
reduction-precipitation step varied from 30 to 417 and the waste
salt showed zirconium removals of 6 to 25%. Cerium removals in
the Mg-Zn supernatant and waste salt were 27 to 36% and 30 to 43%,
respectively. Table I

In the development of the plant-scale retorting furnace, a
number of pilot-scale runs were conducted using the U-Mg-Zn products
recovered from the pilot-plant reduction-furnace runs. Since the
equipment very closely resembled the plant-scale retorting equip-
ment (to be discussed later), details of pilot scale operations
will not be reported. Briefly, the pilot runs demonstrated that
beryllia crucibles were satisfactory retort containers; that the
Zn-Mg alloy could be evaporated and condensed with little loss;
that entrainment of uranium in the distillate was negligible
(<0.01%); and that the uranium product could be consolidated into
a recoverable ingot. Analyses of fission elements in the final
uranium product ingot confirmed the acceptable level of decontami-
nation shown in analyses of product solutions in the reduction
furnace.

Prototype Plant Equipment Performance

Skull-Oxidation Equipment. The skull oxidation equipment
(Figure 6) was tested by oxidizing separately six skulls from the
melt refining of unirradiated uranium-fissium alloy and dumping
the resulting skull oxide powders. The procedure involved
charging the furnace with a melt-refining cruecible and skull and
sealing the furnace with the molten metal seal. All these
operations were carried out remotely using an electromechanical
manipulator similar to the type used in the Fuel Cycle Facility.

Burning was initiated by turning on the control panel which
automatically regulated the burning operation. The operation of
the furnace control system is fairly complex and is explained
in detail in ref. 11. In essence, the system operated on a
"demand cycle'". Consumption of oxygen in the furnace resulted
in a drop in furnace pressure, which initiated a pump-down
cycle to reduce the pressure to a slightly lower level. Oxygen
was then admitted to raise the pressure and continue the burning
operation. This cycle was repeated, with a slight enrichment
of oxygen taking place at each cycle, until all of the metal had
been converted to oxide. At that point no further drop in
pressure took place and a timer control initiated a purge cycle
to turn off the heater and pump out the residual oxygen.

The container holding the crucible and oxide powder was then
transferred to a remotely operated dumper from which the oxide
was discharged into a receiver. The furnace and its control
system performed in a highly satisfactory manner in these tests
and in the Fuel Cycle Facility.

Oxide Reduction Equipment. Eighteen plant-scale (5 kg skull
oxide) runs were performed in the prototype oxide reduction
furnace., The first ten runs (SRR-1 through SRR-10) were made with
the furnace configuration essentially as shown in Figure 7.

316

Preliminary analytical results suggested that contacting con-
ditions were not sufficiently vigorous and several changes were
made in the equipment as well as the operating conditioms. An
additional impeller was placed on the agitator shaft; a temporary
three-bar mixing baffle cage was installed in the crucible;
operating temperatures, and duration of operating steps were
increased slightly. The plant-scale operating flowsheet shown in
Figure 11 was used for test Runs SRR-11 through SRR-18,

A specific difference to be noted between this flowsheet and
the flowsheet in Figure 10 is the absence of ZnCl, in the salt
of the noble metal extraction step. The process is designed to
operate on a sequential basis. New batches of salt and skull
oxide are charged to the crucible, which contains the U-Mg-Zn
heel from the preceding product-transfer operation. If excessive
magnesium is present, some reduction of the oxide from U,0q4 to
uranium could take place., This uranium would be lost in the zinc
extractant. In the flat-bottom crucible used In the pilot plant,
the heel was large enough to require the addition of ZnCl2 to
react with the excess magnesium. In the dished-bottom crucible
used in the plant-scale equipment the relative size of the heel
was smaller., Conversion of the magnesium to oxide was accomplished
by the excess oxidizing power of the uranium oxide (U308 + U05)
and the fission product oxides and no ZnCl, was needed.

Because of the variety of salts and operating conditions
employed in these rumns, consistently reproducible results were
not obtained. However, certain general conclusions can be made
regarding the performance of the equipment under these different
operating conditions.

Mechanical performance of the equipment was generally good.
Control of furnace temperatures and transfer-line temperatures
was readily achieved. Automatic thermocouple-regulated tempera-
ture controllers were used in the furnace heaters, and manual
rheostats were used in the transfer-line heaters.

Samples of salt and metal phases were taken by means of
tantalum dip tubes inserted through the charging port. This
operation was carried out in a manner that could be adapted
readily to remote operation with an electromechanical manipulator.

All metal freeze seals including the main cover seal and the
auxiliary port seals worked very successfully and would be
particularly suitable for high temperature applications in a
radioactive environment.

The improvement in process performance that could be
attributed to the use of the mixing baffle cage, the double
impeller, the higher temperatures and longer duration of operating
steps was relatively modest. Of the changes made, only the

317
installation of the mixing battie cage represented a significant
problem with respect to costs and fabrication. Pressed-and-
sintered tungsten crucibles of this size are difficult to fabri-
cate even without mixing baffles, It, therefore, does not appear
to be expedient to use haffles in a crucible-and-agitator combi-
nation such as was employed in this furnace. All the other
changes are worth retaining.

In Runs SRR-8 and -9, a MgClz-SO mol % CaCl, salt was used and
in Run SRR-10 the salt composition was M3012-36 mol % NaCl-20 mol 7%
KCl, These changes were made to avoid the carryover of Ca™ and F~
ions in the small amount of flux that is transferred with the final
U-Zn~§§ solution produced in the reduction furnace. The presence

of Ca™" and F~ was thought to be deleterious to the beryllia crucible
used in the subsequent retorting step. In the absence of fluoride
ion, the removals of molybdenum, ruthenium, and zirconium, as .
determined by product-solution analyses, appeared to be signifi-
cantly enhanced (80-90% removal vs. 50% removal). However, the
absence of fluoride in the salt mixtures resulted in high uranium
losses (v14%) in the waste salt from the reduction step, indicating
that fluoride ion is necessary to achieve a high degree of reduction
of uranium oxide. Since fluoride salt was necessary to the reduction
step, a simple mechanical technique was adopted to prevent the
carryover of salt with the final product. A cup-shaped trap,
fabricated of alumina~silica fiber, was positioned above the
graphite mold into which the U-Mg-Zn product solution was trans-
ferred. The metal drained through small holes in the bottom of

the trap, while the salt preferentially wet the walls of the

trap and was retained.

The results of the final eight runs are summarized in Table I1I.
In general, the three fluxes tested performed equally well with
respect to uranium reduction and fission product removals. The
primary factor in achieving high uranium reduction (99%) was the
presence of 10 mol %Z fluoride ion, which is shown in comparing
results of Runs SRR-11 and -12 with those of subsequent runs.

The effect of fluoride ion in the noble metal extraction step
upon removal of molybdenum and ruthenium was not clearly defined.
In Runs SRR-15 and -16 with the presence of 10 mol 7 fluoride
ion in the noble metal extraction step, analyses of the product
solutions showed only about 35% removal of molybdenum. In runs
SRR-13, -14, and =18, in the absence of fluoride ion in the salt,
about 70%Z molybdenum removal was achieved. However, in SRR-17
where fluoride ion (10 mol %) was present in the noble metal
extraction step, removal of molybdenum was also about 70%. The
inconsistent behavior of molybdenum may possibly be due to the
fact that the concentration of molybdenum normally exceeds its
solubility in the zinc noble metal extract. Accordingly, the
zinc transfer is made while the solution is moderately agitated
(~v100 rpm). To prevent loss of salt with the zinc, the agitation

is stopped before the zinc transfer is completed. Differences in
mixing speeds employed or premature termination of the stirring
could result in significant differences in the amount of molybdenum
transferred even though essentially equal reductions of molybdenum
oxide could have occurred.

Removals of ruthenium ranged from 80 to 90%. Ruthenium removals
in the absence of fluoride salt in the noble metal extraction step
were slightly better than in the presence of fluoride but the
differences are not considered significant. Cerium removals were
consistently high at about 97%. Removals of zirconium showed a
considerable range between 45% and 75%. However, an average
removal of 657 was considered adequate for the process.

Recovery of uranium in the product solution varied from 81 to
97% based upon analysis of product solution samples. Operational
errors in Runs SRR-15, ~16, and -18 led to high uranium losses in
the waste streams and low uranium recoveries. The results of
runs SRR-13, -14, and -17, which were made under conditions
considered reproducible and consistent with flowsheet requirements,
showed an average uranium recovery of 92.6%. Since pouring yields
for the melt refining process averaged about 937, a recovery
greater than 90% in the skull reclamation process would provide an
overall uranium recovery exceeding 99%.

319
Retorting Equipment. Forty-five runs were completed in the
prototype plant-scale retorting unit. 2) Pertinent distillation
data from a number of these runs are shown in Table III. The
furnace charge consisted of the Zn-Mg-U ingot formed in the
transfer of the product solution from the reduction furnace. All
runs were conducted at a nominal pressure of 10 Torr. The bulk
of the volatile zinc and magnesium present in the charge was
distilled at temperatures of 650 to 750°C. Vaporization of the
remaining volatile material and liquation of the uranium product
were achieved by increasing the temperature to 1150-1200°C for
about 45 min. The resulting ingot was readily dumped from the
crucible. Analyses of the ingots from the plant scale retorting
furnace runs confirmed the fission product removals that were
indicated by analyses of reduction furnace product samples.

Satisfactory containment of the Zn-Mg distillate vapors within
the graphite retorting enclosure was achieved in 43 of the 45
runs (see Fig, 9). In the two other runs, excessively high
distillation rates caused turbulent vaporization of the melt,
which resulted in appreciable loss of the vapors from the enclosure.
The use of the seismic vibration detector and the contact micro-
phone referred to earlier prevented such loss in subsequent runs.

Beryllia was the only crucible material found that would retain
the molten Zn-Mg-U and yet release the final uranium ingot.
Thixotropically cast beryllia crucibles manufactured by the
Brush Beryllium Company of Elmore, Ohio were used in the retortinag
step. Four beryllia retorting crucibles were tested in these
runs and each performed satisfactorily for at least 10 rums.
However, after each rum about 25 g of uranium was found in the
annulus between the beryllia crucible and the graphite secondary
container. This loss of uranium was attributed to seepage of the
Zr-Mg-U solution through the crucible wall. Efforts were made by
the manufacturer to improve the performance of the cruecibles, but
high resistance to seepage could be achieved only at the sacrifice
of resistance to thermal shock. Since the crucibles are expensive,
the very small loss of uranium was considered an acceptable penalty
for achleving a high use factor.

The operating experience with pilot plant and full plant scale
equipment demonstrated that all the steps of the Skull Reclamation
Process could be successfully performed. Although the desired
levels of uranium recovery and fission product decontamination
were not consistently obtained, those levels achieved were
generally adequate. Improvements in overall performance could
be anticipated with increased experience.

Some problems were encountered in procurement of materials
and process equipment which are resistant to the high temperatures
of the process and corrosion by the molten salts and metals.
Tungsten, molybdenum-tungsten alloy and beryllia proved to be

suitable materials. Although fabrication of large tungsten and
beryllia crucibles was difficult and expensive, these items could
be made and they gave satisfactory service, Improvement in
fabrication technology would be necessary to construct crucibles
significantly larger than those used in the plant scale equipment.
The heated transfer lines fabricated out of gun-drilled molybdenum-
tungsten alloy gave very good service in the transfer of both
molten metals and molten salts. The overall mechanical performance
was good and demonstrated that the equipment could be adapted to
the remote operation required in a processing plant. The equip-
ment and technigues employed in the Skull Reclamation Process are
directly transferable to other pyrochemical processes. Some of

the techniques are currently being employed at Ar%onne in the
Plutonium Salt Transport Process for oxide fuels.

Abstract

The Salt Transport Process currently being developed at
Argonne is a pyrochemical scheme for the recovery of fast breeder
reactor fuels. The process objectives are to be able to accom-
modate short-cooled fuels and to provide plutonium and uranium
recoveries of 997 with fission product decontamination factors
of 106 or higher. Stainless steel cladding is removed from the
oxide fuel by dissolution in liquid zinc. The oxides are then
reduced by a Cu-Mg-Ca alloy in the presence of a CaCljy-CaF, flux.
The subsequent plutonium-uranium-fission product separations are
achieved through a series of liquid metal-molten salt extraction
steps. The metallic plutonium and uranium products, which are
recovered by vacuum distillation of the solvent metals, are
reconverted to oxide fuel by oxidation with CO, in a fluidized
bed reactor. The basic chemistry of the process separations has
been investigated and the major emphasis is now on the engineering
aspects. Although the development effort is oriented toward a
complete process for fast breeder reactor fuels, the initial
steps show promise as a head-end treatment for aqueous processing.

Introduction

During the early development of high-temperature, nonaqueous
fuel reprocessing methods, various investigators became interested
in simple purification procedures in which the fuel remains in the
metallic state throughout the process, Because these procedures
were usually typical of those used by the metallurgical industry
and were aimed specifically at metallic fuels, they came to be
known as "pyrometallurgical” processes. The main objectives were
to repair irradiation damage and to restore the reactivity of the
fuel. Most of the proposed pyrometallurgical processes Iinvolved
simple operations that could be performed in a small, on-site plant
to provide rapid recycle of the fuel to the reactor. Because only
modest fission product removals could be achiéved by these methods,
they would require fully remote refabrication of the fuel.

A major achievement in the area of pyrometallurgical fuel
reprocessing was the successful use of melt refining to process
the enriched uranium alloy_core fuel of the Second Experimental
Breeder Reactor (EBR—II).(l'z) Melt refining consists of melting
and liquating the chopped fuel pins in a lime-stabilized zirconia
crucible for one to three hours at 1300~1400°C under a high purity
argon atmosphere. The liquid alloy is then poured into a mold to
form an ingot. During the liquation period, approximately two-
thirds of the fission products are removed through volatilization
and selective oxidation by the crucible. Melt refining is an
integral part of a closed, on-site fuel cycle in which the fuel is
discharged from EBR-II, reprocessed, refabricated, and returned to
the reactor, using fully remote operations. The EBR-II fuel cycle,
including melt refining, was in routine operation for over four
years.

Although melt refining has been successfully demonstrated and
has made it possible to continue the operation of EBR-II in its
present mission as a fast flux test facility, it is not a complete
process in the sense that auxiliary means are required to recover
the unpoured metal and oxide that remaln in the crucible as a
gkull after the pouring step. The skull is, in effect, a side
stream which can be processed to remove noble metals, as well as
other fission products, from the uranium and thereby maintain the
desired concentration of fissium™ in the fuel alloy. Approximately
7% of the uranium in the original melt refining char%e appears in
the skull., An auxiliary "Skull Reclamation Process' 3) was
developed to recover this material, but the process equipment was
not installed in the EBR-II Fuel Cycle Facility because of other
priorities. Nonetheless, the development effort on the Skull
Reclamation Process contributed substantially to the technology
of the pyrochemical processes currently under development.

Pyrochemical processes are distinguished from the earlier
pyrometallurgical processes primarily by the fact that the major
fuel constituents (e.g., uranium, plutonium, thorium) are subjected
to oxidation-reduction reactions, usually in liquid metal and salt
solvents. Separations of flssile, fertile and fission product
elements are effected by techniques such as volatilization, pre-
cipitation, liquid metal-molten salt extraction and electrolysis.
Although these processes tend to be more complex, they offer the
possibility of much greater versatility and higher performance in
terms of recoveries and fission product removal.

The Salt Transport Process, which is currently under development
at Argonne,_ is aimed at stainless steel-clad, uranium-plutonium
oxide LMFBR fuels. The process is expected to accommodate both
core and blanket material and to provide a plutonium recovery of
at least 99%. Because of the relatively low value of the natural
or depleted uranium used in LMFBR fuels, there may be little
economic incentive for immediate decontamination and recovery of
the uranium. It appears, however, that 997 uranium recovery can be
achieved by the process. With a modest amount of multiple staging,
fission product decontamination factors of 10% or greater should
be possible.

Salt Transport Process

A schematic illustration of the proposed Salt Transport Process
flowsheet 1s shown in Fig, 1. The process begins with fuel de-
cladding and includes the subsequent steps through resynthesis
of the oxide fuel material.

Decladding

Stainless steel cladding is removed from the fuel by selective
dissolution in liquid zine, which does not react with the uranium
and plutonium oxides. Fuel assemblies are immersed in the liquid
zinc at about 850°C, A layer of molten CaCl,-20 at. % CaF, is
maintained on top of the zinc to inhibit its vaporization and to
provide a liquid heat transfer medium when the zinc-stainless
steel solution i1s transferred away from the oxide. The release
of some gaseous fission products (Kr, Xe, I, 3H) is anticipated
during the decladding step. These are collected in the argon
cover gas, which is confined for decay and further processing.
Any residual zinc from the decladding step can be removed by
vaporization; the stainless steel in the residual zinc is removed
in the subsequent process steps,

Oxide Reduction

The oxide reduction step is performed in the same vessel as the
decladding step. To carry out the reduction, additional CaCl,-
20 at. % CaF, salt is charged to the vessel and the mixture o
salt and oxiae fuel is contacted vigorously at 800°C with a liquid
Mg-29 at. % Cu-34 at. % Ca alloy. The uranium and plutonium oxides
are reduced to the metals by the calcium and the Ca0 by-product of
the reaction is taken up by the salt. The alkali and alkaline
earth fission products also appear in the salt, which is discarded
as a waste. The remaining gaseous fission products should be
released during the reduction reaction. The argon cover gas is
handled in the same manner as that from the decladding step. When
the reduction is completed, the metallic plutonium is in solution
in the liquid metal phase and the uranium, which has a solubility
of about 50 ppm, forms a bed of precipitated metal.

Plutonium-Rare Earth Separation

Because of the chemical similarity between plutonium and the
rare earths in pyrochemical systems, the separation of yttrium and
rare earth fission products is a key step in the process. The
principal reason for selecting a Cu-Mg alloy as the liquid metal
solvent is that it provides the highest plutonium-rare earth
separation factor of any system that was investigated. The super-
natant Cu-Mg-Pu alloy, including Cu-Mg wash solution, goes to a
semicontinuous mixer-settler battery. Figure 1 shows a seven-stage
mixer-settler, in which the first four stages are used to extract
rare earths from the Cu-Mg-Pu alloy with a MgCl,-30 mol % NaCl-

20 mol % KC1-3 mol % MgF, salt phase. The MgCl, is necessary to
provide the required distribution coefficients for a practical
separation. The NaCl and KCl serve as diluents to lower the melting
point of the salt well below the desired operating temperature of
about 650°C. The small amount of fluoride is used to promote
disengagement of the liquid salt and metal. Under practical
conditions it appears that a plutonium-rare earth decontamination
factor of approximately 100 can be achieved in each stage. Each
of the four stages is operated with a captive salt phase and the
Cu~Mg-Pu alloy is a transient phase. After each batch of fuel is
processed, the salt from the first stage is discarded as waste,
the salt in the second, third and fourth stages is moved ahead one
stage, and new salt is added to the fourth stage.

Plutonium Salt Transport Separation

In the last three stages of the mixer-settler as it is shown
in Fig. 1, the plutonium is recovered from the Cu-Mg alloy, which
retains the more noble fission products (Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh,
Pd....). A molten salt of the composition mentioned previously
(MgClz-30 mol % NaCl-20 mol % KC1-3 mol % Mng) is used as a carrier

329
to transport the plutonium from the fifth stage through the sixth
stage to the last stage. In this operation the plutonium is ex-
tracted from the Cu-Mg ''donor'" alloy into the salt and then extracted
from the salt into a Zn-30 at. % Mg "acceptor' alloy which has a
high affinity for plutonium. In the sixth stage the salt is con-
tacted with a captive Mg-20 at. Z Mg alloy to remove any residual
noble metal fission products and any Cu-Mg alloy that might be
entrained in the salt. The plutonium salt transport step is carried
out simultaneously with the rare earth extraction step. During

this operation the plutonium is removed continuously from the

Cu-Mg alloy cycling through the first five stages of the mixer-
settler and is transported to the Zn-Mg acceptor alloy. After the
plutonium is removed, the Cu-Mg alloy is recycled to the oxide
reduction step for the next batch of fuel, Since only traces of
noble metal fission products and entrained Cu-Mg alloy reach the
Cd-Mg alloy in the sixth stage, this latter alloy can be used for
many batches of fuel before it 1s discarded as waste. The plutonium
salt tramsport step 1s expected to provide a decontamination factor
of 106 or greater for the noble metal fission products.

Plutonium Recovery

The Zn-Mg-Pu alloy from the last stage of the mixer-settler is
transferred to a retorting vessel where the zinc and magnesium are
removed by vacuum distillation. After retorting, the plutonium
metal product is recovered as an ingot.

Uranium Salt Transport Separation

The metallic uranium precipitate in the decladding-reduction
vessel is dissolved in a Cu-6 at. %Z Mg alloy in which the solubility
of uranium is about 4 at. % (14 wt %) at 900°C. This stream is fed
to a four-stage salt-metal extraction. Although it has been shown
that plutonium does not coprecipitate with uranium in the oxide
reduction step, a small amount (up to about 1%) may be trapped
physically in the uranium bed. The first stage of the uranium
treatment is used to extract any plutconium from the Cu-Mg-U alloy
with a MgCl, salt phase, which is recycled to the next batch of fuel.
The other tﬁree stages are a uranium salt transport separation
which is identical in principle to the plutonium salt transport
step, but which operates under somewhat different conditioms. A
Mg-17 at. % Zn acceptor alloy is used, the intermediate alloy
between the Cu-Mg donor and the Zn~Mg acceptor is zinc or cadmium,
the salt phase is 100Z MgClz, and the operating temperature is
about 850°C. The first three contacts are made in a mixer-settler
unit and the fourth stage i1s a vessel in which the uranium, which
has a low solubility in the Zn-Mg alloy, is accumulated as a
precipitate. A portion of the Cu-Mg alloy from the uranium salt
transport separation becomes a waste containing the noble metal
fission products and the remainder is recycled.

330

If the uranium is to be stored for deferred recovery, it could
be alloyed with a small amount of another metal such as iron to form
a liquid phase that could be transferred out of the decladding-
reduction vessel and cast into ingots.

Uranium Recovery

The liquid salt and metal are transferred away from the pre-
cipitated uranium bed in the uranium accumulation vessel. The bed
is then vacuum-melted to form a product ingot.

Fuel Resynthesis

The metallic uranium and plutonium products are alloyed in the
appropriate proportions, charged to a fluidized-bed reactor, and
then hydrided and dehydrided to form a fluidizable powder. The
powdered metal is first nitrided and then converted to mixed
U0p~Pu0, by treatment with CO5.

Status of the Process Development

Most of the laboratory studies that were needed to select
appropriate solvent systems for the Salt Transport Process have
been completed. This work has resulted in a substantial body of
data on phase diagrams, solubilities, distribution coefficients
and thermodynamic properties for various metal and salt systems.
This information is useful not only as a basis for the Salt Transport
Process, but alsc for new pyrochemical process applications that
might be envisioned. The chemical feasibility of all of the major
separations has been established in laboratory-scale experiments.
However, more detailed studies are needed on some items such as the
mechanism of oxide reduction, the morphology and physical nature of
metallic precipitates, possible radiolytic effects in the salt
golvents, and the behavior of minor fission products and by-products
such as curium and neptunium.

Engineering investigations have been in progress for some time
on general pyrochemical operations such as mixing of metals and
salts, phase separations and transfers, fluidization techniques
and retorting. Although the major effort is being devoted to
mixer-settlers for contacting liquid salts and metals, studies
have also been conducted on stirred tanks and packed columns.

Small-scale tests have been performed with mock fuel assemblies
consisting of 13 type 304 stainless steel tubes with a 35-mil wall
and three 1/4-in. thick spacer plates. Each tube contained 12 high-
fired U0, pellets and one pellet that had been ground to a fine
powder. At 800°C,the zinc dissolved the tubing in less than 30 min
and the spacers in 3 to 4 hr. It was found that over 95% of the

331
zinc could be transferred out of the vessel without entraining more
than about 0.2% of the oxide. Other studies of the decladding
procedure showed that the 310 series stainless steels, zircaloy and
irradiated 304 stainless steel all dissolve more rapidly than the
unirradiated 304 stainless steel.

In various laboratory and bench-scale engineering tests it has
been shown that both powders and high-fired forms of U02, uo —Pu02
and Pu0, can be reduced completely by the proposed method. e
reduction procedure has been carried out on a scale of up to about
5 kg of U0, pellets.

A series of runs were made in which the oxide reduction, plutonium-
rare earth separation, plutonium salt transport and plutonium retort-
ing steps were performed in sequence with about 200 g of plutonium,
800 g of uranium and 100 g of inactive fission product elements. The .
results were in good agreement with the process performance pre-
dicted on the basis of the laboratory data.

The removal of the nobler fission products from uranium was also
demonstrated in separate salt transport experiments involving about
2 to 5 kg of uranium. The recovery of uranium from Zn-Mg alloys
had been investigated earlier during the development of the EBR-II
Skull Reclamation Process.

Only a minor amount of work has been done on the fuel resynthesis
step. Uranium metal was converted to U0y by the hydriding and
COZ—hydrogen treatments in a fluidized bed, but achieving close
control of the stoichiometry together with a low carbon content
of the product proved to be difficult. A few exploratory tests
have indicated that hydriding followed by nitridation with nitrogen
gas and conversion of the nitride to U0, by 002 is a more promising
method.

Most of the engineering effort is currently devoted to the
construction of a glpvebox facility in which all the steps of the
Salt Transport ProtCess can be performed sequentially on a scale of
about 1 kg of plutonium, 4 kg of uranium, and 1 kg of fission
products (ndn-radioactive). High temperature mixer-settlers for
the multistage plqunium decontamination steps are being developed
for this facility. 4) Although no provision is being made for
handling irradiated fuels in the facility, engineering techniques
which have been, or could be developed for remote operation are
being employed in many instances.

A continuing effort is made to test and select materials that
are suitable for use in pyrochemical process equipment. This work,
which is concerned mostly with refractory metals and ceramic
materials, is the subject of a separate paper in this symposium.(s)

332
Some preliminary studies have been made on a conceptual design of
a Salt Transport Process with a capacity of one tonne/day of LMFBR
core and blanket fuel (equivalent to about 15,000 MWe). It appears
that two decladding vessels about 7 ft tall and 18 in. in diameter
would be required with three fuel assemblies being declad at a time
in each vessel. These vessels would most likely be made of tungsten
or have a tungsten lining. The oxide reduction operation would be
done in the same vessels. The mixer-settler bank for rare earth
removal and plutonium salt transport would be about 20 x 24 in. and
about 6 ft long. Niobium appears to be a suitable material for
this unit, except in the last stage where tantalum or a tantalum
lining might be used. In the plutonium retorting step, criticality
considerations probably would require three units of slab geometry
about 20 x 30 in. by 1-1/2 in. thick, although a single unit may
be feasible. The three-stage mixer-settler for uranium decontamina-
tion would be about 10 x 20 in. and 2 ft long. This equipment
and the plutonium retort would both be made of a refractory metal,
such as tungsten. The uranium accumulation vessel could be made of
graphite and would be about 18 in. in diameter and 5 ft tall, For
fuel resynthesis, two 8-in. dia and two 24-in. dia fluidized bed
reactors about 6 ft tall would be used for core and blanket
material, respectively. Stainless steel would be a suitable
material for these units. In addition to the major process equip-
ment, various other vessels would be required for making up and
charging solvents, holding process solutions and disposing of
waste streams. Nevertheless, it appears that a plant of this
type would be quite compact.

Discussion

For the near term at least, LMFBR fuels will most likely be
oxide, clad with stainless steel. The core fuel is expected to
consist of natural or depleted U0, and about 15-20% Pu0,. The
core may be operated at a specific power as high as 200 kW/kg
(U + Pu) and reach a burnup of 100,000 MWd/tonne. The blanket,
initially natural or depleted UOZ’ may contain up to about 4%
plutonium at discharge and reach a burnup of arounﬂ 15,000 Mwd/
tonne. In most of the proposed LMFBR designs, the core fuel and
axial blanket are included in the same assemblies and the radial
blanket consists of separate assemblies.

The present practice in the commercial reprocessing of light
water reactor (LWR) fuels is to cool the fuel for about six months
to alleviate the problems of fission product heat removal, iodine
release and radiation decomposition of process solvents. However,
the high plutonium content of IMFBR core fuel results in a large
capital investment and a correspondingly strong incentive to
minimize the out-of-reactor fuel inventory. Therefore, it is highly
desirable, if possible, to decrease the cooling time to 30 days or

333
less. This short cooling time, together with the high burnup and
specific power of IMFBR fuel, poses some difficult problems in fuel
reprocessing. In a typical IMFBR fuel assembly containing 60 kg of
fuel, the rate of heat generation from fission product decay after
30 days of cooling would be about 13 kW or 44,000 Btu/hr. It is
apparent that provisions must be made to handle wvery high levels

of heat and radiocactivity. For example, it would be necessary to
dilute 30-day-cooled IMFBR core fuel by a factor of about 50 to
reach the same heat and radiation levels as those encountered in
the processing of six-month-cooled LWR fuels, A particularly
troublesome problem that is anticipated with short-cooled LMFBR
fuels is the 1ar§e amount of radioactive fission gases that are
present (mainly 11 and 133%e). The activity of these gases in
30-day-cooled IMFBR fuel 1s expected to be about 10° times greater
than that in the LWR fuels currently being processed.

It appears that a pyrochemical process for LMFBR fuels could
provide attractive solutions to many of these problems. The
proposed zinc decladding procedure replaces the mechanical dis-
assembly and chopping steps conventionally used in aqueous process-
ing. A prior sodium removal step, other than simply allowing
adhering sodium to drain off, should not be necessary, nor would
sodium-logged fuel pins be expected to create a problem. The
removal of fission product decay heat may be considerably simplified
by the high operating temperatures and the presence of liquid metal
and salt solvents. The gaseous fission products are collected in a
small volume of inert gas and most of the iodine activity 1s ex-
pected to remain in the salt waste. The process wastes are produced
directly as solidified salts and metals, The process appears to be
capable of handling high~fired U0y, Pu0, and either mixed or solid-
solution UOZ—PuOZ.

Although the Salt Transport Process is being developed on a
long-range basis as a complete process for future LMFBR fuels, it
might prove attractive to use the initial steps as a head-end
procedure for aqueous processing of interim LMFBR fuels in existing
plants. This head-end process might include decladding, oxide .
reduction, a plutonium-uranium separation and partial decontamination,
depending on the requirements of the aqueous plant. It is felt
that this possibility deserves further consideration.

Abstract

Uranium and plutonium may be separated from each other and from
nobler metal impurities by the salt transport method in which a
solute 1s transferred selectively from one liquid alloy (donor)
to another (acceptor) by cycling a molten salt between the two
alloys. Data have been obtained on the solubilities of uranium
and plutonium in liquid alloys of magnesium with copper, zinc and
cadmium and on their distribution behavior between these alloys
and salts containing MgCl,. The chemical basis for the partitioning
of plutonium, uranium and impurity elements between the salt and
metal phases is discussed and the factors that enter into a salt
transport separation are described, It has been shown by labcra-
tory and bench-scale engineering experiments that the transport
of plutonium and uranium takes place as predicted from the solubility
and distribution coefficient relationships. Although the salt
transport procedure is being developed for the reprocessing of
nuclear fuels, it has potential application to the separation and
purification to other metals, as well as plutonium and uranium.

Introduction

The term "salt transport" has been applied to a purification
technique whereby a metallic solute is transferred selectively
from one liquid alloy (donor) to another liquid alloy (acceptor)
by circulating a molten salt between the two alloys. The transfer
takes place through oxidation of the solute by the salt at the
donor alloy and its subsequent reduction by the acceptor alloy. The
objective of the present studies was to investigate the chemical
aspects of plutonium and uranium salt transport purification steps
that could be incorporated into a pyrochemical process for fast
breeder reactor fuels,

Various survey papers have been published on high-temperature
liquid metal-molten salt extraction methods for the processing of
nuclear reactor fuels.,(1-8) certain investigations that were
carried out earlier at Brookhaven National Laboratory and at Ames
Laboratory are particularly relevant to salt Transport separations.
The Brookhaven work involved a process that was being developed for
the fuel of the proposed LMFR (Liquid Metal Fuel Reactor).(g'lz
This process employed a procedure in which UCl, in a molten salt
phase was reduced selectively by a Bi-Mg alloy to separate uranium
from rare earth fission products. The uranium was then re-oxidized
by a new salt stream and reduced again by Bi-Mg to form a Bi-Mg-U
fuel alloy. At Ames Laboratory, Chiotti (13 patented a salt trans-
port method for removing rare earth fission products from a Th-Mg
alloy. The rare earths were selectively oxidized by MgCl, and
subsequently removed from the MgCl, by reduction with a Zn-1Q0 at. %
Mg alloy. This work was extended gy Chiotti and Klepfer, 14) who
developed a salt transport separation employing liquid Th-Mg and
Zn-Mg alloys in mutual contact with a salt,

In the present studies, magnesium alloys of zinc, cadmium, and
copper were Ilnvestigated as potential donor and acceptor alloys
for the purification of plutonium and uranium from the fission
product elements more noble than uranium by the salt transport
process. These studies included measurements of the solubility
of plutonium and uranium in the liquid alloys and measurements of
the distribution coefficient for plutonium and uranium between
liquid magnesium alloys and molten salt mixtures containing MgClz.

Chemical Basis of Salt Transport Separations

Partition of Solutes between Liquid Metals and Salts

The salt transport separation of plutonium and uranium from
each other and from the more noble impurity elements depends
primarily upon differences in the distribution of uranium,
plutonium, and impurity elements between liquid metal and salt
solvents. In general terms, a metal, M, partitions between a

338
liquid magnesium alloy and a molten salt phase containing MgCl,
by the following reaction:

M(alloy) + gngCIZ(salt) z MCln(salt) + %-Mg(alloy) (1)

The thermodynamic (activity) equilibrium comstant, K, can be
expressed in terms of mole (or atom) fraction, x, and activity
coefficient, Y, of the reactants and products as follows:

n/2 n/2
xMc1 " Fug YMCl " Tvg

a n/2 . .n/2 (2)
xM ngCl ™M = TMgcCl

K

The distribution coefficient, D, for the metal, M, is defined as
the ratio of the mole fraction of MCl in the salt to the atom
fraction of M in the alloy:

*Mc1

D-an (3)

The equilibrium constant, K_, is related to the standard free
energy change, AG®, for Reaction 1 by the equation

- - ° o ° _ °
RT In K AG AGfMCl 2 AGfMgCl (4)

where AGfMCl and AGfM gCly are the standard free energies of

formation of MCln and MgClZ, respectively. Equation 4 indicates
that metals whose chlorides have larger negative free energies of
formation than that of MgCl, (on a per mole of chlorine basis)
will tend to distribute preﬁominantly to the salt phase (K > 1).
When the free energy of formation of MCln has a lower negative
value than that of MgCl, (Kz < 1), the metal, M, will tend to
distribute to the alloy phase.

By substitution and rearrangement, the distribution coefficient
may be expressed in logarithmic form as

AG®
log D 2 3RT + (= log aM + log YM) - (— 103 aMgCl+ log YMCl )

(5)

where three groups of terms are shown in the right-hand side. The
first group, the single term AG®/2.3RT, depends both on the value
of the free energy of formation of MCl, relative to the valug for
M3012 and on the temperature. The second group of terms, -5 log
log yyMs depends on the composition of the liquid magnesium
%oy and on the temperature; it is indepepdent of the salt
composition. The third group of terms, - 7 log aMgClz + log YMCln'

339
depends on the composition of the salt and on the temperature.

In general, the distribution coefficients of various elements fall
in the same order as the free energies of formation of their chlo-
rides. However, large differences occur in the distribution
coefficients because of solvent effects. For example, the values of
the distribution coefficient at 600°C for praseodymium, cerium, and
plutonium are lowered several orders of magnitude when Zn-low Mg

or Al-low Mg alloys are substituted for Cu~Mg alloys.

Examination of the free energies of formation of fission product
metals and structural materials (Table I) shows that the salt
transport process should be particularly useful for the separation
of plutonium and uranium from more noble fission product metals
(Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh and Pd) and from metals such as Fe, Cr and
Ni, which are typical constituents of alloys used to clad nuclear
reactor fuel elements. These free energies of formation suggest
that zirconium would be most difficult of these elements to
separate from uranium and plutonium by partitioning between salt
and metal phases.

Several attempts to measure the distribution coefficient of
zirconium between molten salts containing MgCl, and liquid magnesium
alloys resulted in values of 10~%4 or less in all cases. The actual
value may be even smaller, since it 1s difficult to avoid slight
contamination of the salt samples by the alloy. Thus, zirconium
and all the elements below it in Table I should be separated readily
from uranium and plutonium by a process in which the uranium and
plutonium are extracted into a molten salt.

The difference in the distribution behavior of two elements,
M, and My, is expressed as a separation factor, o

o = = (6)

The separation factor is strongly dependent on the composition
of the liquid alloy, and to a lesser extent on the temperature
and on the composition of the molten salt.

Salt Transport Separations

A salt transport procedure for uranium is i1llustrated
schematically in Fig. 1. Metallic uranium, which is initially
present in the donor alloy, is oxidized and extracted into the
transport salt. The nobler metals and structural metals remain

When the transport salt containing the UCl, is contacted with the
acceptor alloy, the reverse reaction takes place:

UCla(salt) + %Mg(acceptor alloy)»U(acceptor alloy)+%MgC12(salt) (8)
Therefore, the net reaction is

U(donor alloy)+%Mg(acceptor alloy)-+U(acceptor alloy)+%Mg(donor alloy)
(9)

Magnesium chloride consumed at the donor alloy by oxidation of
uranium and plutonium is regenerated at the acceptor alley by
magnesium reduction of UCly or PuCl,. Thus, the salt composition
remains constant throughout the salt transport operation. For each
mole of uranium transferred from the donor alloy to the acceptor
alloy, 1.5 moles of magnesium are transferred in the opposite
direction. The increasing concentration of magnesium in the donor
alloy and magnesium depletion in the acceptor alloy must be taken
into account in the design of a practical process.

When Reaction 9 has reached equilibrium, both alloys are in
equilibrium with the transport salt, and the ratio, R, of uranium
in solution in the acceptor and donor alloys is equal to the ratio
of the distribution coefficients of uranium for each alloy and
the salt:

R = at. Z U in acceptor alloy _ D{(donor alloy) (10)
at, Z U in donor alloy D(acceptor alloy)

The transfer of a solute (e.g., uranium or plutonium) from the
donor alloy to the acceptor alloy is achieved by circulating the
transport salt between the two liquid alloys. Although a variety
of methods may be used to circulate the transport salt between
the two alloys, all are basically similar in that a quantity, ng
(moles), of transport salt is contacted with a quantity, , of
donor alloy to transfer the solute to the transport salt. A
fraction, X, of this transport salt and, under some conditions
(i.e., if entrainment of liquid metal occurs), a small fraction,
Z, of the donor alloy 1s contacted with a quantity, n,, of the
acceptor alloy to transfer the solute from the transport salt to
the acceptor alloy. The transport salt is then returned to the
donor alloy to complete the cycle. The fraction, F,, of the
uranium or plutonium present in the transport salt—gonor system
that transfers to the transport salt-acceptor alloy system is
given by D 'Eg X+ 7

where D, and D, are the distribution coefficients of the solute

alloy systems, respectively. It may be shown that after s cycles,
corresponding to the circulation of a quantity, sn X, of tramsport
salt, that the fraction, ¢, of the solute initially present in the
transport salt-donor system transferred to the transport salt-
acceptor alloy system is given by

A s
b= Q-7 QA-F), (13)
where F = (1 - F ) (1 -F,) (if it is assumed that none of the

solute is present initially in the acceptor alloy). Equation 13
indicates that the fraction transferred approaches a limiting
value (given by the first factor) as the number of cycles, or the
quantity of salt cycles, is increased, The maximum possible
fraction, ¢ » transferred is given by
max F
A A“D

¢ =1l-7—=1- (14)

where the approximation is good to about 1%.

Equation 14 indicates that if the ratio n,/n; is unity, then,
for a 99% transfer, Dp should be about 100 times D,. The number of
cycles, or the quantity of transport salt cycled to achieve a given
percentage of the maximum possible transfer, is dependent only on
the value of F. For example, to reach 997 of the maximum possible
transfer when F = 0.5 requires about seven cycles; whereas, when
F =0.7, 13 cycles are required. Large values of Dp favor rapid
transfer.

Equations 11 to 14 are derived on the assumption that all the
uranium or plutonium present in the transport salt-donor alloy
or transport salt-acceptor alloy systems is in solution, either
in the alloys or the transport salt. However, uranium and plutonium
have limited solubilities in several usable alloys. If, for example,
the uranium present in the transport salt-donor alloy system is not
all in solution, then the fraction of the total uranium present
that is transferred to the acceptor alloy during each cycle of the
transport salt would be less than would be the case 1f all the
uranium present were in solution. Therefore, limited solubility
of uranium in the donor alloy increases the number of cycles of

344
transport salt required to transfer a given fraction of the uranium
to the acceptor alloy. The quantity of uranium transferred from
the donor alloy to the acceptor alloy during each cycle will be
constant (assuming equilibrium is established) until sufficient
uranium has been transferred so that the amount remaining is
completely in solution.

If the uranium has a limited solubility in the acceptor alloy,
the acceptor alloy will become saturated after a few cycles of the
transport salt and the amount of uranium back-transferred to the
donor alloy will reach a constant value. This constant value is
lower with a saturated acceptor alloy than 1t would be if the
amount of uranium in solution in the acceptor increased with
each cycle of the transport salt. The overall effect of limited
solubility in the acceptor alloy is to decrease the number of
transport salt cycles needed to transfer a given fraction of
uranium. The maximum possible fraction transferred may also be
increased by limiting the uranium solubility in the acceptor alloy.
Thus, in Eq. 14, the term (PA ™0)/(PD ®A) is multiplied by the
solubility of uranium in the acceptor alloy expressed as a fraction
of the uranium initially charged to the system. A low solubility
of uranium in the acceptor alloy can be used to compensate for
a large value of the distribution coefficient, Dy

The fraction of the uranium initially present in the transport
salt-donor alloy system that may be transferred to the acceptor
alloy may be increased if the uranium present initially exceeds
the sclubility. For example, in a system in which a maximum
transfer of 977 is possible when the donor alloy is initially
just saturated, the amount transferred may be increased to 997 by
Increasing the amount of uranium present to five times the
solubility limit. However, the number of transport salt cycles
required is increased from about 13 for the case of 97% transfer
to about 21 for 99% transfer.

The same principles that govern the rate of transfer of
uranium and plutonium apply to the impurities that are present
in the donor alloy. Impurities for which the value of F (Eq. 11)
is small compared with the value of F, for uranium or plutonium
are separated by the salt transport process. Generally these
impurities are those for which the value of D is several orders
of magnitude smaller than the value of Dp for uranium or plutonium.
An estimate of the decontamination factor, D.F., possible with the
salt transport process can be obtained from the expression

- % (uranium or plutonium) (15)
) (impurity)

D.F.

The fraction of uranium or plutonium transferred, ¢ (uranium or
plutonium), will be approximately unity, i.e., essentially all
will be transferred. For small values of FD’ the quantity ¢

345
(impurity) (Eq. 13) is approximately equal to sF,\, where s 1is the
number of cycles needed to transfer the desired fraction of uranium
or plutonium, and Fﬂ 1s the fraction of impurity transferred from
the donor. Substitution in Eq. 15 gilves
1
D.F. = = (16)

s
s(DD o X+ 2)

which summarizes most of the important factors that influence

the degree of decontamination obtainable with the salt transport
process. The D.F. is inversely proportional to the number of
transport salt cycles, s, or the amount of salt circulated, to
achieve the desired uranium or plutonium transfer. It is also
seen that the fraction of donor alloy entrained with the transport
salt must be smaller than D! 28 X if the maximum possible decontam-
ination is to be achieved. The small values of Dﬁ for the nobler
fission products ‘(see K, values in Table I) indicate that the
decontamination factor in practical systems will depend upon the
extent to which entrainment of the donor alloy with the transport
salt can be eliminated.

Molten Salt-Liquid Alloy Systems for
the Salt Transport of Uranium and Plutonium

As indicated earlier, the rate of uranium or plutonium transport
from a donor alloy to an acceptor alloy depends upon (1) their
distribution coefficients between each alloy and the transport
salt and (2) their solubilities in the two alloys. Therefore,
distribution coefficients and solubilities of uranium and plutonium
in various systems of process interest were investigated experi-
mentally., The distribution coefficients of uranium and plutonium
between molten MgCl, and liquid Cu-Mg and Zn-Mg alloys at 800°C
and molten MgCl,-30 mol % NaCl-20 mol %Z KCl1l and liquid Cu-Mg,

Cd~-Mg and Zn-Mg alloys at 600°C are shown in Figs. 2 and 3,
respectively. 1In general, as the magnesium content of the alloy
is increased from a near-zero initial value, the distribution
coefficients decrease at first, pass through a minimum, and

then increase. An exception to this generalization is the
distribution of plutonium between the ternary salt mixture and
Cu-Mg alloys at 600°C. The values of the distribution coefficients
shown in Figs. 2 and 3 are nearly independent of the plutonium
or uranium concentration in the alloy. A discussion of the
dependence of the distribution coefficient on the ma%nesium
content of the alloy has been presented elsewhere, (15)

The solubilities of uranium in liquid Cu-Mg and Zn-Mg alloys

and plutonium in liquid Zn-Mg alloys at 800 and 600°C, respectively,
are shown as a function of the magnesium content of the liquid alloy

alloys at 600°C is also shown in Fi%. 5. Values of the solubility
of plutonium in liquid Cu-Mg alloys 16) are so large that solubility
is not an important factor in limiting the use of Cu-Mg alloy as a
donor for plutonium., A discussion of the dependence of the solu~
bility of uranium and plutonium in liquid magnesium alloys appears
elsewhere.

The amount of uranium or plutonium that can be transferred in
each cycle of the transport salt between the donor and acceptor
alloys depends upon the amount of salt transferred and the uranium
or plutonium content of the salt. At equilibrium, the uranium or
plutonium content of the transport salt is the product of the
uranium or plutonium content of the alloy and the distribution
coefficient.

mol Z M (salt) = at., Z M (metal) x D (11)

To obtain a large uranium or plutonium content in the salt
equilibrated with the donor alloy, both the solubility and
distribution coefficients in the donor alloy-salt system should
have large values, Conversely, to obtain a small uranium or
plutonium content in the salt equilibrated with the acceptor alloy,
both the solublility and distribution coefficients in the acceptor
alloy-salt system should have small values. Mass transfer of
uranium or plutonium and magnesium between the donor and acceptor
alloy stops when the equilibrium uranium or plutonium content of
the transport salt is the same above both alloys.

The maximum uranium and plutonium content of (1) molten MgCl
in equilibrium with saturated liquid Cu-Mg and Zn-Mg alloys at §00°C
and (2) MgCl,-30 mol % Nacl-20 mol % KCl in equilibrium with
saturated liquid Cu-Mg, Zn-Mg and Cd~Mg alloys at 600°C is
shown in Figs. 6 and 7, respectively. These curves may be used
to determine the compositions of donor and acceptor alloys for
uranium and plutonium, For example, at 800°C, only a low
magnesium (v16 at, %) content Cu-Mg alloy would be a practical
donor for uranium, while Zn-Mg alloys with either low (15 at. %)
or high (>60 at. %) magnesium contents would be practical
acceptor alloys for uranium. The compositions of the most promising
donor and acceptor alloys of those studied for uranium and
plutonium are summarized in Table II. At 800°C the Cu-16 at. % Mg
alloy is a donor for both uranium and plutonium, the Mg-20 at. % Zn
alloy is a donor for plutonium and an acceptor for uranium, while
the Zn-10 at. %Z Mg alloy 1in an acceptor for both uranium and
plutonium. At 600°C none of these systems is a very good uranium
donor, but both the Cu-43 at. % Mg and the Mg-20 at. % Cd alloys
are plutonium donors while the Zn-15 at, % Mg alloy is an acceptor
for both uranium and plutonium. It is also evident from Table II
that the plutonium donor alloys are more effective donors than the
uranium donor because of the relatively low solubility of uranium.

3uhen high plutonium solubility exists, the distribution coefficients provide the basis
for evaluating the relative donor properties of the alloys.

bThe values of the distribution coefficients are increased by about a factor of two by
substituting MgCl,22 mol % MgF, for MgCl,-30 mol % NaCl-20 mol % KCl and by increasing
the temperature from 600 to 650°C.

€A1l of the salt-alloy systems shown are acceptors for the nobler metals.
The donor and acceptor alloys listed in Table II may be used in
various combinations to permit (1) selective separation of plutonium
from the nobler metal fission products and uranium, (2) separation
of uranium from the nobler metal fission products, (3) simultaneous
separation of plutonium and uranium from the nobler metal fission
products and (4) separation of plutonium and uranium from each
other and from the nobler fission product elements.

Plutonium Purification and Recovery

In the Salt Transport Process for fast breeder reactor (LMFBR)
fuels, plutonium is first separated from uranium and the nobler
metal fission products and then the uranium is separated from these
fission products in a subsequent step. The plutonium separation
employs a salt transport step with a Mg-43 at. % Cu donor alloy and
a MgCl,-30 mol % NaCl-20 mol % KC1l-3 mol % MgF, transport salt™ at
600°C.” To remove any entrained Mg-Cu donor alloy from the salt
and to increase the degree of decontamination of plutonium from
the nobler metal fission products, the transport salt is contacted
with an intermediate Cd-50 at. % Mg alloy before it reaches the
Zn-30 at. % Mg acceptor alloy. The intermediate alloy is a
plutonium donor and an acceptor for the metals more noble than
plutonium. The following is a schematic illustration of the
process,

+ Transport Salt _é
(A) Salt (B) salt |__ (C)
DONOR ALLOY INTERMEDIATE ALLOY ACCEPTOR ALLOY
(Mg-43 at. % Cu) (Cd-50 at. % Mg) (Zn-30 at. % Mg)

Since the solubility of uranium is only about 0.0025 at. % in
the Mg-43 at. % Cu alloy at 600°C, very little uranium is extracted
into the transport salt. Entrainment of the donor alloy in the

transport salt is likely to be a more significant source of plutonium

contamination by uranium and the nobler metal fission products

(see Eq. 16). The intermediate alloy is expected to remove most

of the entrained donor alloy from the salt. Since this intermediate
alloy is not as effective a plutonium donor as the Mg-Cu allioy,
there is a tendency for some plutonium to build up during the

first few cycles of the transport salt. As the number of cycles

is increased, however, this plutonium is transferred to the

acceptor alloy. The fraction of the plutonium in each alloy was

*

of the MgCly, and the small amount of MgF, aids the disengagement
of salt and metal phases in the contacting equipment,

calculated as a function of the number of cycles. After

10 cycles of the salt, about 927 of the plutonium would be in the
acceptor alloy, about 8% would remain in the intermediate alloy
and the amount in the donor alloy would be negligible. The
plutonium in the intermediate alloy represents an inventory, which
is recovered as the next batch of fuel is processed. When, after
many cycles of operation, it becomes necessary to replace the
intermediate alloy because of the gradual buildup of donor alloy
and fission products, the residual plutonium can be recovered by
additional cycles of the transport salt.

When the amount of plutonium in the acceptor alloy exceeds the
solubility limit (0.07 at. % at 600°C), it precipitates as a
plutonium-zinc intermetallic compound (probably Pu22n17).(l7) This
occurs after only a few salt tramsport cycles., If the equipment
that is used to contact the transport salt with the acceptor alloy
can accommodate the metallic precipitate, several batches of
plutonium would be transferred to the acceptor alloy. The purified
plutonium is recovered as the metal by vaporization of the zinc
and magnesium at reduced pressure. If the contacting equipment
cannot handle the precipitated metal, continuous means will be
required for removing the acceptor alloy from the contactor,
vaporizing the zinc and magnesium and returning them to the
contactor. The optimum composition of the acceptor alloy depends
somewhat upon the mode of operation of the contactor, since the
magnesium content of the alloy decreases as plutonium is trans-
ferred. However, this effect (see Eq. 8) is not large enough to
interfere seriously with the operation if provisions are made for
periodic additions of magnesium to the acceptor alloy.

Uranium Purification and Recovery

In the Salt Transport Process for IMFBR fuels,(ls) uranium
1s separated from the nobler metal fission product elements by
the use of a Cu~-16 at. % Mg donor alloy, a molten MgCl, transport
salt, and a Mg-17 at. % Zn acceptor alloy at a temperature of
800 to 900°C. The operation of this donor alloy may be illustrated
by referring to the copper-rich region of the Cu-Mg-U system as
shown in Fig. 8, This representation must be regarded as tentative
as it was constructed from the Cu-U and Cu-Mg binary diagrams and
limited data from the Cu-Mg-U ternary system. Point M is an
eutectic in the Cu-U binary alloy. Point C is an eutectic in
the Cu~-Mg binary alloy. Point N is estimated to be the ternary
Cu-Mg-U eutectic. Hence, the curve M-C-N describes an eutectic
valley. Point D is the composition of the liquidus of the Cu-Mg
binary at 800°C. Point C is the 800°C liquidus on the eutectic
valley, and C-D 1s the 800°C liquidus 1sotherm between the eutectic
valley and the Cu-Mg binary. Line A-B is an operating line that
is the path that the bulk composition of the donor alloy will

follow as the transport of uranium takes place. The line
represents the change in bulk composition that results from
depletion of the uranium by MgCl, oxidation and the resultant
buildup of magnesium in the donor alloy. These composition
changes are related by the equation

U+ 3/2 MgCl, + UCl, + 3/2 Mg (18)
which indicates that 1.5 moles of magnesium are introduced into

the donor alloy for each mole of uranium removed. Any peint, E,
lying on the operating line represents an initial bulk composition
of the donor alloy. Point B is the bulk composition of the donor
alloy upon completion of uranium transport. At point E the
equilibrium phases present are (1) a solid phase containing uranium,
which is believed to be the intermetallic compound, UCug, (2) a
Cu~-Mg solid solution, and (3) a liquid phase of composition C.

As uranium transport proceeds, the bulk alloy composition moves
along the operating line, A-B, from point E toward point C. The
compound UCu5 dissolves, replacing the uranium extracted from the
liquid donor alloy by the transport salt:

UCus(solid) + U(Cu~-Mg liquid) + 5Cu (Cu-Mg liquid) (19)

The copper released by dissolution of UCug and Cu-Mg solid
solution combines with the magnesium that is introduced by uranium
reduction of MgClz to produce additional liquid of the eutectic
composition (point C) at the operating temperature

Cu(solid solution) + Mg(Cu-Mg liquid) -+ Cu-Mg(Cu-Mg eut.). (20)

Thus, the composition of the liquid phase remains constant as the
ratio of the liquid to solids increases.

When point C 1s reached, all of the solids are consumed. As
the transport of uranium continues, the bulk composition follows
the operating line from point C to point B, and Cu-Mg solid
solution is formed. The composition of the liquid phase in
equilibrium with the Cu-Mg solid solution 1s represented by the
800°C 1iquidus isotherm, C-D. During this last phase of uranium
transport, all of the uranium in the donor alloy is in solution.

To control the magnesium buildup in the donor alloy during
uranium transport, the operating line should pass through the
liquidus on the eutectic valley at the operating temperature.
This liquidus composition on the eutectic valley is the compositiocn
the liquid phase will have as UCug and Mg-Cu solid solution dissolve,
Under the above conditions the system provides (1) control of
magnesium buildup in the donor and (2) operation at optimum donor
compositions. The optimum donor compositions provide maximum uranium
solubility and the highest uranium distribution coefficient at the

355
specified operating temperature during the transport of uranium.

Multiple Separations

It is possible in principle to effect multiple separations by
using three or more liquid alloys in combination with the transport
salt. For example, plutonium, uranium and the nobler metals might
be separated from one another by a salt transport procedure in which
the plutonium and uranium are collected in separate acceptor alloys.
This separation can be accomplished by using (1) a Cu-low Mg donor
alloy, (2) a Cd-high Mg plutonium donor-uranium acceptor alloy. At
800°C the values of the plutonium solubility and distribution
coefficient are such that the plutonium content of the recycled
transport salt leaving the Zn-Mg acceptor alloy is undesirably
large. It is possible, however, to lower the melting point of ‘
the donor alloy by the addition of cadmium (i.e., Cu-15 at. % Cd-
1.5 at. % Mg) and to use a MgC12—22 mol % MgF, (m.p. 626°C) transport
salt instead of MgCl, (m.p. 716°C) to permit operation at 700°C.

The Cu-Cd-Mg alloy is a satisfactory donor for both plutonium
and uranium and it retains the nobler metals. The Cd-Mg alloy is
a plutonium donor, but it 1s an acceptor for uranium, primarily
because of its low solubility., At 700°C, beta uranium metal is
precipitated in this alloy. The plutonium collects in the Zn-Mg
acceptor alloy, and if its solubility is exceeded it precipitates
as a plutonlum-zinc intermetallic compound.

Multiple donor and acceptor alloys can also be used to increase
the number of stages of a salt transport separation. In the
Salt Transport Process for LMFBR fuels the use of an additional
donor alloy in the plutonium salt transport step greatly increases
the decontamination of plutonium from the nobler metal fission
products,

Experimental Investigations of ‘
Salt Transport Separations

Several laboratory-scale experiments were performed to investi-
gate the feasibility of salt transport separations. The apparatus
consisted of two adjacent cylindrical tantalum crucibles which
were welded together with a low common wall (Fig. 9) so that the
transport salt could be poured back and forth between the donor
and acceptor alloys, Dams at the upper edges of the crucibles
prevented overflow of the salt when the crucible was tilted to
pour the salt from one side to the other. The charge to the
donor crucible was 87.0 g of copper shot, 43.0 g of magnesium
rod and 20.92 g of plutonium metal, The initial charge in the
acceptor crucible was 178.6 g of zinc and 12.5 g of magnesium rod.

The system was heated to 600°C and the salt was poured from the

The salt and metal phases were equilibrated for 30 min, at an
agitation rate of 500 rpm and allowed to settle 15 min. before the

tration in the donor alloy was 0.181 wt %, or about 1% of the total
plutonium, which indicates that about 99% had been transferred to
the acceptor alloy. The plutonium content of the salt was negli-
gible. Some copper (0.1 wt %) was found in the acceptor alloy,
probably as a result of donor alloy entrained in the salt. These
results showed that plutonium can be transported satisfactorily.

The salt transport concept was also tested in a laboratory
experiment %8 which irradiated cerium was used as a stand-in for
plutonium.( ) The donor alloy was 60 g of Mg-44 at. 7 Cu con-
taining 2.5 g of irradiated cerium and the acceptor alloy was
100 g of Zn-12.4 at. % Mg. The transport salt, 180 g of MgCl,-

30 mol Z NaCl-20 mol % KCl, was added to the donor alloy initially.
The dual crucible technique was used at a temperature of 600°C.

The metal and salt phases were contacted for 60 min. with agitation
at 300 rpm and allowed to settle 30 min. In each cycle, 80Z of

the salt was transferred. Five cycles of the transport salt
resulted in 897 transfer of the cerium. The significance of this
experiment is that the rate of cerium transport was in agreement
with that predicted from equilibrium values of the solubilities

and distribution coefficients.

Five larger-scale experiments were perfeormed to investigate
the behavior of uranium in a salt transport separation. 20 The
feed charges, containing from 2 to 5 kg of uranium, were prepared
either by reducing unirradiated oxides of uranium and nobler
metal elements (Zr, Mo, Pd, Ru, and Nb) with Cu-Mg alloy or by
direct addition of these metals to the Cu-Mg alloy at 925°C. 1In
either case, most of the uranium at the operating temperature of
845°C was present as a finely divided precipitate. The donor
alloy was Cu-12 at. % Mg, the acceptor was Zn-83 at. % Mg and
MgCl, was used as the transport salt. Both alloys were contained
in tungsten crucibles and the salt was cycled between the alloys
by pressure-siphoning through a heated transfer line. Prior to
each salt transfer the salt and metal phases were mixed for 4 to 6
min. and then permitted to settle for 5 to 10 min. After about
99% of the uranium had transferred to the acceptor alloy, the
supernatant liquid alloy was transferred away from the precip-
itated uranium bed, and the bed was washed with Mg-14 at. % Zn
alloy. A uranium recovery of about 99% was achieved after 27
cycles of the salt. The overall removals of the nobler metals
were 99.7% for zirconium and 99.9%Z or more for the others.

A separation of plutonium from uranium and the nobler metal

358
fission product elements was demonstrated in a study in which the
steps of the Salt Transport Process for LMFBR fuels were performed

in sequence. 21 The original feed to the series of process steps
was 199 g of plutonium as PuO,, 400 g of uranium as uo, and oxides

of 24 representative fission product elements. In the salt transport
step the plutonium was transferred at 600°C from a Mg-44 at. % Cu
donor alloy to a Zn-5.2 at. % Mg acceptor alloy, using a MgCl,-30
mel % NaCl-20 mol 7 KC1l transport salt. The pressure-siphoning
technique was used to cycle the salt., After 14 cycles, 99.3%

of the plutonium had been transported.

Various other salt transport experiments have been conducted,
including ones in which the salt was cycled continuously between
donor and acceptor alloys. 2) oOn the basis of mass-transfer rates,
stage efficiencies and salt-metal phase disengagement results that
have been obtained, further technological development of the salt
transport procedure is expected.

Conclusions

The salt transport technique is being developed primarily as a
means of separating plutonium, uranium and the nobler metal fission
products in a pyrochemical process for the recovery of LMFBR fuels,
To provide a basis for selecting suitable liquid metal and salt
solvents, basic chemical data were obtained on the solubilities
of plutonium and uranium in liquid alloys of magnesium with copper,
zin¢ and cadmium and on their partitioning behavior between these
alloys and molten salts containing MgCl,. It was found in both
laboratory and bench-scale engineering experiments that the
equilibrium solubility and distribution data can be used reliably
to predict the behavior of a practical salt transport system for
plutonium or uranium. Preliminary engineering studies have indicated
that the procedure shows promise for technological development
and it has been inccrporated into the engineering investigations
for the Salt Transport Process for IMFBR fuels,

Although the current development of salt transport separations
is concerned mainly with fuel reprocessing, there are numerous
cther applications of potential interest. For example, some work
has been done on a process of this type for the recovery and
purification of plutonium-238 from recycle scrap material, (23) 1t
might also be applied to the processing of other high-value actinide
metals (e.g., neptunium and curium) as well as other more conven*=
tional metals such as the rare earths.

Abstract

Previous studies of the reductive extraction of protactinium and
uranium from molten fluoride mixtures into liquid bismuth contain-
ing thorium gave results which suggested this as a feasible method
for processing MSBR fuels. Additional studies have been undertaken
to confirm the equilibrium quotients for the extraction reactions

and to determine -whether these equilibrium quotients depend signifi-
cantly on the concentration of Pa® and/or U° in the bismuth phase.

Experiments have been conducted at 625°C + 5° in molybdenum-
lined nickel containers using bismuth and single-region MSBR fuel
carrier salt (LiF-BeF -ThF,, 72-16-12 mole %) with up to 0.3 mole %
of UF; and >100 ppm 231pa., Thorium, uranium, and protactinium were
added incrementally in order to duplicate, as nearly as possible,
the varied concentrations that would exist in an extraction column
such as might be used for the process.

The experiments have yielded data which show a correlation of
log D, vs log D, which would be expected from the stoichiometry
of reactions (1) and (2). This seems conclusive proof that Th+4,
Pat4 and are the important species, and that there are no sig-
nificant interactions of U° and Pa® under the reducing conditions
of these experiments.

Introduction

The potential advantages of molten-salt-fueled reactors have
been recognized for some time, and their characteristics have been
reviewed by Briant, Weinberg, MacPherson, Grimes and others, (1-4)
This type of reactor has been fully demonstrated at Oak Ridge
National Laboratory with the successful operation for more than
10,000 equivalent full power hours of the 8 megawatt Molten-Salt
Reactor Experiment,

One of the principal advantages of molten-salt fuels is their
adaptability to continuous reprocessing without the attendant high
cost of refabrication of solid fuel elements. Thus, molten-salt-
fueled reactors are particularly attractive as breeder reactors
when it is desired to continuously recover 233y and 233pa bred into
the fuel from 232Th.

Previous studies by Shaffer, Barton, and Ferris (5-8) of the re-
ductive extraction of protactinium and uranium from molten fluoride
mixtures into liquid bismuth gave results which suggested reductive
extraction as a feasible method for processing MSBR (Molten-Salt
Breeder Reactor) fuels. A flowsheet proposed by Whatley and
McNeese(9) for such processing includes an extraction column for
reducing protactinium and uranium from the fuel salt. In this
system the salt stream enters the bottom of the columm and flows
counter-currently to a bismuth stream containing thorium and the
reduced metals. Since protactinium is intermediate in nobility be-
tween uranium and thorium, the protactinium refluxes in the middle
of the column where the salt builds up the highest protactinium
concentration., At this point in the column a hold-up tank is pro-
vided in order to allow the 233Pa to decay to 233U in a region away
from the neutron flux of the core. Thus, high protactinium
concentrations in the core which would adversely affect the breed-
ing ratio are avoided.

While the feasibility of such a process had been indicated,(s's)
i1t was necessary to confirm the equilibrium quotients for the ex-
traction reactions, and to determine also whether these equilibri-
um quotients depend significantly on the concentrations of Pa®
and/or U° in the bismuth phase.

Theory

The extraction reactions are of the general type

where XM

(F)

X denotes mole fraction, and subscripts F and Bi denote fluoride
and bismuth phases, respectively. The assumption of constant ac-
tivity coefficients seems reasonable since the species involved are
present in the bismuth phase at very low concentrations and are in
the fluoride phase as either low concentration solutes or major
components whose concentrations would not be affected significantly
by the extraction equilibria.

When the distribution coefficients are known, Q may be calculat-
ed from the relationship in Eq. (3) if the valence states of the
species in the fluoride phase are known, or by using the log form,

71

the ratio of the valence states may be determined from the slope of
a log-log plot of the distribution coefficients. Experiments were
conducted in which the distribution coefficients were determined at
various metal specie concentrations,

Experimental

The general experimental technique involved equilibrating a
molten fluoride mixture (LiF-BeFp-ThF;) containing Pa and/or urani-
um with bismuth containing thorium. Since Pa concentgations great-
er than 100 ppm were involved in these experiments, lpa was used
in order to avoid the high gamma radiation level associated with

3pa. However, the 231Pa, being an alpha emitter similar in tox-
icity to 2 9Pu, required glove box containment for the experiments.
The glove boxes used have been described in detail by Barton(6),

The materials were purified prior to thorium addition by pro-
longed (24 hours) treatment with H,-HF (10:1) followed by reduction
with Hy alone. The Hy was stripped out, and equilibration was af-
fected in an argon atmosphere. A schematic diagram of the equilib-
ration system is shown in Figure 1. The major components of the
system are a diaphragm type circulation pump, a flowmeter for

monitoring the rate, the reaction vessel, and traps containing
sodium fluoride and magnesium perchlorate to remove any traces of
HF and water which may be present. During the normal course of an
experiment, the valves from the supply header and to the off-gas
were closed. High-purity argon was recirculated thru the dip-leg.
The dip-leg by—-pass was open at times such as during sampling or
additions in order to avold the possibility of forcing melt up the
dip-leg.

A schematic detail of the reaction vessel is shown in Figure 2.
In a typical experiment this vessel contained about 200 grams each
of salt and bismuth, The carrier salt used in all experiments re-
ported here was a 72-16-12 m/o mixture of LiF-BeFy-ThF,, which is
being considered as the fuel carrier for a single-region MSBR. The
bismuth was of six-nine purity, according to the manufacturer's
analysis. The mixture was contained in a molybdenum lined nickel
or steel vessel at a temperature of 625°C + 5°. The molybdenum dip-
leg was designed to lift the bismuth and discharge it into the salt
phase, since bench tests conducted in silica apparatus revealed
that simple gas bubbling merely rocked the salt-bismuth interface.

An assembled reaction vessel, along with a sampler of the type
used is shown in Figure 3. The vessel is 1-1/2 inches in diameter
and 8 to 12 inches high. The total length from the ball valve is
about 20 inches. Samplers of this length containing a sintered
metal frit in the bulb were fabricated from copper, molybdenum or
steel.

These samplers were inserted thru a teflon seal secured above
the ball valve, and the experiment was sampled as desired. The
material was removed from the sampler, weighed, placed in a vial,
and brought out of the glove box train thru a bag-out port. The
vial dropped into a plastic tube which was sealed with a thermal
sealer. The alpha contaminated sample could then be safely handled
outside the glove box. It was gamma scanned for 233Pa tracer or
transmitted to analytical for other analyses.

Procedure and Data

Equilibrium distribution data were obtained in two slightly dif-
ferent types of experiments. In the first type, purified carrier
salt containing PaF, and UF, was brought into contact with bismuth
containing enough thorium to reduce all the protactinium and urani-
um and leave about 1500 ppm thorium in the bismuth. The initial
salt concentrations were: UF4 - 0.2 to 0.3 mole Z and Pat% about
90 to 125 ppm. The distribution of these solutes and thorium be-
tween the salt and bismuth phases was determined by analysis of
filtered samples of the two phases. Figure 4 shows protactinium
and thorium concentrations for an experiment of this type as a
function of contact time. This experiment was extended for about

one week in order to demonstrate the stability of the system. The
concentrations held essentially constant for this period. The
uranium distribution is not shown on the plot; however, it stayed
constant with about 987 of the uranium in the bismuth and less

than 2% in the salt. The material balances in this experiment were
about 100% for uranium and 95% for protactinium.

The second type of experiment involved initial purification of
the salt and bismuth together. The protactinium and/or uranium
were added prior to hydrofluorination of the melt. Crystal bar
thorium was then added in small increments after sparging with Hp
and stripping with argon. By sampling the phases after each thor-
ium addition, distribution data were obtained at various concen-
tration levels. Figure 5 shows data obtained in an experiment of
this type. The protactinium concentration is plotted as a function
of thorium added. Uranium was also present in this experiment, and
during the early thorium additions uranium was being reduced while
the protactinium concentration held constant. Toward the end of
the experiment thorium saturation of the bismuth was indicated by
loss of protactinium from the bismuth on further addition of thor-
ium. Co-precipitation of thorium-protactinium bismuthide probably
occurred. This was indicated by the thorium analysis and by the
fact that the protactinium reappeared in the bismuth phase when
the temperature was raised to 805°C.

In some of these '"titration'" type experiments, in which the re-
ductant was added incrementally, protactinium was reduced in the
absence of uranium. These data are included in Figure 6 where
protactinium distribution is plotted as a function of thorium
concentration in the bismuth. Plots of thorium concentration are
equivalent to plots of thorium distribution, since thorium in the
salt is essentially constant. The data are plotted on a linear
scale in this case in order to minimize the effect of analytical
scatter at very low thorium concentration.

The closed circles show data obtained in the absence of uranium.
The 805°C line was drawn to the single point obtained when the tem-
perature was raised as mentioned previously. The 625°C data for
protactinium and thorium are represented very well by a straight
line; uranium concentration has no apparent effect on the distribu~-
tion. The failure of the representative line to pass thru zero is
attributed to trace amounts of oxidizing impurities which reacted
with some of the thorium.

Figure 7 shows the 625°C for protactinium and uranium distribu-

tion. 1In this case a log-log plot is used, and a straight line
representative of this data has a slope of 4/3.

Discussion

On the basis of data shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7, the follow-
ing extraction stoichiometry is indicated:

+4 o e o +4

Pa(F) + Th(Bi) = Pa(Bi) + Th(F) (5)
+3 o . o +4

AU(F) + 3Pa(Bi) = AU(Bi) + 3Pa(F) (6)
+3 ) . o +4

AU(F) + 3Th(Bi) = 4U(Bi) + 3Th(F) (7)

The plot of protactinium-thorium distribution (Fig. 6) was lin-
ear, indicating a 1 to 1 ratio of their valences in the salt as
shown in reaction (5). The 4/3 slope of the log-log protactinium-
uranium distribution plot (Fig. 7) indicates the valences shown in
reaction (6). It follows that the uranium-thorium reaction would
be as shown in reaction (7).

it seems conclusive that under the conditions of these experi-
ments, both protactinium and thorium were in the +4 state and uran-
ium in the +3 state when reduction into the metal occurred. TUsing
these valences and the experimentally obtained distribution data,
the equilibrium quotients may be calculated from the relationship
as shown in Eq. (3). At 625°C

These quotients may be used to obtain separation factors

(aM2 = DMllDM2) at a particular thorium concentration. For a

thorium concentration of 1800 ppm in the bismuth, the separation
factors are

These separation factors are considered adequate for the MSBR fuel
reprocessing scheme mentioned previously(g), and pilot plant mock-
up should be forthcoming soon.

373
The ease with which molten-fluoride fuels can be reprocessed,
coupled with the extremely successful MSRE, should lead to the

Abstract

Chemical and engineering development studies of fuel reprocessing
schemes for the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor Program at the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory are based on the extraction of protactinium-233,
fissionable uranium, and certain fission product species from the
fluoride fuel mixture upon reduction into bismuth. As a part of this
experimental program, the reductive extraction of rare earths, the
major soluble poison fraction in an MSBR, from selected salt mixtures
in the LiF-BeF,-ThF, ternary system into bismuth was investigated.
The distributions of cerium, neodymium, samarium, lithium, and thorium
between the two liquid phases were calculated as reaction equilibrium
constants, distribution coefficients, and separation factors and were
related to variations in salt composition. The magnitudes of these
values establish the chemical feasibility of the extraction method
for rare earth removal from MSBR fuels by multistage processing
techniques.

Results

Analytical results of samples taken during the extraction experi-
ments with cerium were calculated as equilibrium quotients according
to equation (3). A least squares evaluation of each data set by the
expression,

_X 1
log DCe =% log DTh + 4 log K , (6)
yielded good agreement with the theoretical slope for x = 3. Average
values for were then evaluated for slope = .75 and the standard

deviation of log K determined. These values together with similar
evaluations for the reduction of lithium by thorium and by cerium
are summarized in Table I. Distribution coefficients and separation
factors at reported values for thorium saturation in bismuth at 600°C
were calculated from these values for K, and are listed in Table 11(9),

Since the important fission product neutron poisons are within the
first six members of the lanthanide series, additional experiments
with neodymium and samarium were considered as representative of this
group. On the basis of preceding results with cerium, these experi-
ments were conducted with the fluoride solvent, LiF-BeF,-ThF,(72-16-
12 mole %) at 600 and 700°C. The results are summarized in Table III.
Values for the maximum distribution of thorium in the system were
also based on Reference 1.

-Discussion

The sequence of experiments was chosen flrst to evaluate salt
solvent effects on the extraction system and then to establish the
comparative extractability of other rare earths of interest. Although
cerium is not an important fission product, it was used for the first
phase of this program to simplify analytical procedures. Neodymium
and samarium also have gamma emitting isotopes, but their energy
spectra at low levels in bismuth are more difficult to resolve in the
presence of extractable thorium daughter activities than is the case
for cerium. Analyses for cerium-144 were obtained using a conven-
tional sodium iodide scintillation crystal while analyses for
neodymium-147 were obtained with a lithium-drifted germanium diode.
Samarium analyses required neutron activation of enriched samarium-152
to obtain reasonable results.

Some effect of salt composition on the extraction system was
expected on the basis of earlier work. The formulation of compounds
in molten alkali fluoride-BeF,; and alkali fluoride-MF, binary mixtures
inferred the existence of BeF,2~ and MIVF,3~ as anionic species in the
melt and suggested a fluoride bridging concept 10), These ions were
the basis of an empirical correlation of solvent effects on HF solu-
bility in these binary salt systems(ll). Equilibrium crystallization
by mixtures of LiF, BeF,, and ThF, in composition regions near that of
the proposed MSBR fuel solvent produce as final products the two
crystal phases, 2LiF-BeF, and 3LiF.ThF, SS{12), Formulation of these
compounds suggested an analogous empirical correlation to describe
salt solvent effects on the reductive extraction equilibria(13).

This concept was based on the assumption of equal affinity of fluoride
ion for beryllium and thorium and their coordination by the number of
fluoride ions in the solid compounds Li,BeF, and Li3ThFy. An excess

or deficit of "free fluoride" concentration was defined by the relation,

Free fluoride = M7 LiF-2 (MZ BeF,) -3 (M% ThF,). (M
Deficits in "free fluoride" ion are then expressed as negatilve

quantities. As shown by Fig. 1, the equilibrium quotients for the
reduction of cerium by thorium at 600°C can be reasonably correlated

within the precision of the data, similar plots of equilibrium quotients
for the reduction of lithium by thorium and by ceriumyielded discon-
tinuous functions.

Although the experimental data cannot be adequately correlated by
this simple function of salt composition, the free fluoride concept
does provide a basis for estimating the extractability of rare earths
and, as shown by Fig., 2, their separation from thorium over the salt
composition ranges of interest to the MSBR program. These data were
considered in the present selection of the fuel solvent composition,
LiF-BeF;-ThF, (72-16-12 mole %). Contributing data for the extraction
of neodymium and samarium from this solvent into bismuth further con-
firmed the chemical feasibility of this fuel reprocessing method.

THE MOLTEN SALI' EXTRACTION OF AMERICIUM
FROM PLUTONIUM METAL

ABSTRACT

The removal of americium from molten plutonium metal with molten
salt mixtures was investigated, A process was developed and put
into production operation., Approximately 90% of the americium is
removed from plutonium metal initially containing in excess of
1000 ppm of americium with two extractions, using equal weights of
metal and NaCl-KCl~-2.5 w/o MgCl,. The average cost of the pro-
duction molten salt extraction step was 3,1 man-hours per kilogram
of product metal,

INTRODUCTION

Americium-241 grows in plutonium by the beta decay of 241py,
The separation of americium from plutonium can be of interest either
for obtaining americium or for purifying the plutonium, or beth,
As an example of purification needs, suppose that a purity specifi-
cation of 1000 ppm exists, Also, suppose that plutonium metal is
available which contains 950 ppm impurities. If the plutonium
contains 0.5% 2% Pu, thenthe purity specification will be exceeded
in three months, Another example of the need to remove americium
from plutonium is in the fabrication of ZPPR fuel elements, At the
casting temperatures used for ZPFR fuel elements, americium distilled
away from the plutonium to the top of the furnace and created a
health physics exposure problem. The removal of the americium prior
to casting would have eliminated the problem. At Rocky Flats, some
of the plutonium metal requires only the removal of americium. Thus,
a direct separation would be advantageous,

Extensive information has been reported in the past few years on
molten metal-molten salt systems, The work which was done at Los
Alamos Scientific Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory has had
the most influence on our work in the molten salt-molten metal area,
This was particularly true in the molten salt electrorefining of
plutonium, which was initially patterned closely after the work at
Ios Alamos, The equipment now used for the production molten salt
extraction operation was designed for electrorefining, but since
the time cycle is much shorter for molten salt extraction, the
equipment has been put to that use, Fortunately, the electrorefining
cells are versatile enough to permit reasonable, but not optimum,
production rates,

Simplified Theory

Americium is a thermodynamically active metall, Therefore,
reactions of the type

nAm + (2 or 3)MP e nm(*2 02 13) 4 (2 or 30

are expected to occur to a degree of campleteness largely dependent
upon how active americium is as compared to M. Plutonium is also

an active metal, but not as active as americium!, Thus, if a
separation is to be made, based upon oxidatlion reduction reactions,
one important factor is the relative activity of americium, plutonium,
and the metal M, Another important factor could be the rates of
reaction between americium and plutonium with o Other factors
which could influence the separation are complexing of reaction
products or actually removing reaction products from the reaction
vessel,

386
EXPERIMENTAL

Our first molten salt extraction experiments were completed in
1963, The general approach was suggested by earlier work which
showed that an appreciable amount of plutonium entered the salt
phase as an ionic species when molten plutonium metal was stirred
with a molten salt composed of sodium chloride and potassium chloride,
Similar behavior was expected for americium because of it's reac-
tivity. In essence, what is required for molten salt extraction is
illustrated in Figure 1 where the cut-away drawing shows a molten
salt phase and a molten plutonium metal phase being agitated. The
cell is surrounded by an argon atmosphere, One of the initial
americium extraction experiments with NaCl-KCl indicated that the
reaction was diffusion controlled i1f the metal phase was not stirred,
since the rate of appearance of americium in the salt phase followed
a parabolic rate law as shown in Figure 2, Other experiments with
the same salt mixture showed that about 504 of the americium could
be extracted in approximately 10 hours if both phases were stirred
(Table I), The americium concentration in the salt phase increased
almost linearly during the period of stirring between 2 hours and
12 hours for experiments 1 and 2. The rate was approximately
75 ppn/hour,

The percent of americium extracted was calculated in two ways
whenever possible: one was based on the metal phase before and after
extractlion, and the other based on the metal phase before and the
salt phase after extraction, The calculated values were averaged
and the variability from the average was determined, The plus or
minus variability 1s a reflection of the variability in the americium
material balance,

All subsequent work was done with magnesium chloride added to the
equimolar sodium chloride-potassium chloride mixture., The removal
of fission products from a fissiwn alloy with this salt system has
been reported®, The salt was premelted and sparged with dry HCl gas
for 20 minutes. After this treatment, the amount of magnesium
present in the oxide form was less than 24 of the total magnesium
added as the chloride, The effect of the addition of 6 w/o magnesium
chloride on the extraction is shown in Figure 3 where the concen-
tration of americium in the salt phase is plotted versus time, The
initial americium concentration in the metal was 130 ppme The
americium extracted was 74+ 1% within the first hour and this did
not appear to change appreclably within the next five hours as
evidenced by the curve in Figure 3, The behavior of magnesium
chloride and plutonium chloride in the salt phase is shown in Figure
4e As with the americium, the greatest change in plutonium concen-
trations took place in the first hour in the presence of an excess
of magnesium chloride, The data in Figure 4 can be converted to
0497 w/o plutonium in the salt phase after a stirring time of one
hour,

Experiments 1, 2, and 3 in Table II indicate trends in the extrac-
tion efficiency brought about by variation in magnesium chloride
concentrations and by variations in salt-to-metal weight ratios.
Comparison of the first two experiments indicates that the lower
percent extraction in the first experiments is due to the lower
magnesium chloride concentration, Comparison of experiments 2 and
3 indicates that increased extraction efficiency was obtained with
the larger salt-to~-metal weight ratio for experiment 3.

wxperiments 79-7 and 79-8 in Table II show the extraction octained
with an Initial magnesium chloride concentration of 2,5 w/o and a
salt-to-metal weight ratio of 1,0 with a relatively high concentration
of americium in +the feed metal, There was no significant difference
in extraction with stirring times of 2 or 3 hours. The plutonium
concentration in the salt phase increased with time,

The data in Table III show the extraction obtained, and the
plutonium found in the salt phase at 800°C with 2.5 w/o magnesium
chloride and a stirring time of 1 hour, The extraction appears to
be slightly greater than that obtained at 730°C (Table II), but the
total plutonium concentration in the salt phase increased by a factor
of more than two and apparently included substantial quantities of
metallic plutonium,

An equation was developed to relate the percent americium extracted
to the metal-to-salt weight ratio with temperature and MgClz concen-
tration held constant. The equation is

% Am extracted = Kam x 100
R + KAm

where R is the metal~to-salt weight ratio and Ku, is defined as the

concentration of americium in the salt phase divided by the concen=
tration of americium in the metal phase, after extraction., Kp, is
assumed to be constant, at least over a limited range of americium
concentrations. 4 plot of three calculated curves is shown in Figure
5 along with three experlmental points3, The feed metal in each case
contained 1543 ppm of americium, The salt phase inltlally contained
2.5 w/o MgClps The extractions were carried out at 745°C, The
stirring time was 1 hour,

DISCUSSTON

The reactions responsible for transferring americium and plutonium
to the salt phase are assumed to be oxidation-reduction reactions
between americium and plutonium in the metal phase and either sodium
chloride (when no magnesium chloride is present) or magnesium chloride
in the salt phase, In fact, visual observation and analytical data
supported the conclusion that sodium metal and magnesium metal were
products of the reactions in the respective salt mixtures., The

oxidation state of the americium in the salt phase has not been
determined, but is assumed to be the trivalent state, However, an
investigation at Los Alamos of the system NaCl-KCl-PuCla-Am in
plutoniun metal supported a divalent state for americiun?* and it is
entirely possible that the divalent state is involved in this work.
Although the conditions are different, the observation that americium
favors the salt phase in comparison to plutonium is found to be in
line with the distribution data obtained at Argonne®,

Extraction Variability

The extraction data in Tables I and II show a much greater range
in the plus or minus variability for those experiments made without
magnesium chloride in the salt phase as compared to the experiments
in which substantial concentrations of magnesium chloride were present,
The reason for this was not determined, but non-representative
sampling due to salt phase inhomogeniety was suspected,

The proper combination of analytical errors and weighing errors tor
the extraction data in Tables II and III would permit a plus or minus
variability of approximately 3, i.e., the percent extracted would
be written as XY + 3. All of the variability values fall within
this approximation except for experiment No, 1, Table II in which
the magnesium chloride concentration was low,

FPhase ogeni

Salt phase inhomogeniety effects were eliminated from the 150-
gram scale experiments by using the entire salt phase for the sample,
Salt phases from six 150-gram scale experiments were submitted for
analyses in three portions per experiment, No inhomogeniety was
detected within analytical error. However, the plutonium concen-
tration between portions frequently varied by a factor of 2, This
could have been due to the presence of plutonium oxide which would
not be distributed uniformly in the salt phase, Approximately 0.5
gram of plutonium in the oxide form concentrated in one salt portion
would have been sufficient to cause most of the observed variations,

Height Changes

In general, weight lost by the metal phase and weight gained by
the salt phase in any given experiment amounted to less than 2% of
the initial weight of each phase, Notable exceptions were observed
for the experiments carried out at 800°C (Table III), Weight losses
and gains of greater than 6% were found for experiments 79-1 and 79-2.
Also, substantial quantities of metallic plutonium were apparently
detected in the salt phases by hydrogen evolution analyses as shown
in Table III, These analyses could be erroneously high if magnesium
metal was present in the salt phase, but this does not seem probable
because of the high vapor pressure of magnesium metal at 800°C.

397
Thus, plutonium metal probably existed in the salt phase, but the
mechanism responsible has not been determined,

Extraction Equation

The usefulness of the equation used to generate the calculated
curves in Figure 5 obviously depends upon K, reaching or approaching
a constant value, Although a true equilibrium condition cannot be
claimed, the extraction versus time data in Figure 3 and in Table II
do indicate that the extraction, and hence the ratio of the americium
concentrations in the salt and metal phases approaches a constant
value, The equation may be easily transformed into the expression

pem Am in salt x whk, salt
ppm Am in metal x wt., metal + ppm Am in salt x wh. salt

g E= x 100

The variation (if any) of K, with varying concentrations of americium
in the plutonium metal feedA%as not been determined,

An investigation to obtain additional information on process
variables i1s currently underway, but a process was proposed and put
into pilot plant operation based on the data presented here,

PILOT PLANT RUNS

Pilot plant runs provided additional data on the effect of
metal-to-salt weight ratio as shown in Figure 6. The trend shown
by the data points tends to support the calculated curve, but the
value of Kpy which might be inferred from the data points could be
in error because of probable stirring deficiencies during the pilot
plant runs, The stirring system was redesigned prior to production
operation,

PRODUCTION RUNS

Two types of crucible material were proven to be satisfactory -
magnesium oxide and tantalum metal, Because of the subsequent
problems in recovering the plutonium from the discarded magnesium
oxide crucibles, the majority of the production work was done in
tantalum crucibles,

The conditions established for a large scale production throughput
are shown in Table IV, The temperature within the production cells
was not measured directly. Thus, there could have been temperature
variations of up to 50° from cell to cell,

During one three month period, a total of 414 kg of plutonium
metal was obtained as product from molten salt extraction. Each
batch of plutonium metal feed was contacted twice with an equal
weight of salt., The feed metal contained an average of 1380 ppm
americium. Random samples of the plutonium metal product, after

The plutonium lost to the salt phase is being recovered by an agqueous

actually lower than 140 ppm. Thus, the percent extraction was higher
than 90%. No correction can be made to account for the americium
growth because of lack of knowledge of the dates of growth,

CONCLUSIONS

Although production cost data are not yet available on the proces-
sing of salt residues generated by molten salt extraction, estimates
made from the processing of similar residues indicate that the total
cost of molten salt extraction (double pass operation) should be
about one~half the cost of aqueous processing of metal via the
peroxide process, Obviously, the aqueous process removes impurities
other than americium, but for plutonium metal in which americium is
the only undesirable impurity, the processing cost advantage lies
with molten salt extraction.

Abstract

In a programme designed to explore the chemical feasibility of
using molten chloride mixtures as fuels for a fast reactor, experie-
ments have been carried out on a molten mixture of NaCl and UCl
containing UClh,which would arise as a result of valency imbalagce
in the process of fission. Available thermodynamic data suggest
that over a readily controllable range of UCl, concentrations the
melt should be compatible with potential structural metals and be
stable towards disproportionation of the trichloride. The
measured stability of UCl, and preliminary corrosion tests show
that in the melt UCl# is less corrosive than predicted.

The solubility of oxide has been measured over a range of
temperature and UCl), concentrations. The minimum solubility
recorded is sufficiently high to avoid problems of oxide precim
pitation. Uranium dioxide has been shown to be the stable phase
in contact with the melt under the conditions of interest.

Introduction

The attractions of fluide~fuels for nuclear reactors have been
recognised for many years. These arise particularly from their
resistance under irradiation to physical damage, the possibility
of continuous processing for the removal of fission products and
the inherent nuclear stability arising from the large negative
temperature coefficient of reactivity. Considerable effort has
been devoted to the study of several possible fluid fuels, such
as uranyl sulphate in heavy water for the H.A.R. and uranium metal
in 1liquid bismuth for the L.M.F.R. In the long run, however, a
fuel based on molten salts has proved to be the most successful.
By selecting components with suitable properties a molten salt
mixture can be produced which has, in addition to the features
listed above, low corrosion of structural materials, low vapour
pressure, low parasitic neutron capture and adequate solubilities
of both fissile and fertile materials. The extensive work of the
OCak Ridge National Laboratory on molten fluorides has culminated
in the squ?ssful operation of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment
(MsS.RENV/,

In several respects a fuel based upon the uraniumeplutonium
cycle in a fast reactor is preferasble to the thorium=uranium cycle
in a thermal reactor. Several groups have considered the various
ways in which the demonstrated advantages of molten salts may be
applied in fuelling a fast reactor. This application would involve
two fundamental changes from the fluoride solution of the M.S.R.E.
Firstly, a higher density of fissile material would be required
to achieve criticality and secondly, an alternative to fluoride
would be required since the low atomic weight of fluorine would
result in some moderation and a softening of fhi neutron spectrum,
as in the epithermal system studied at Julich 2),

The high fuel density imposes limitations upon the possible
methods of cooling the fuel. Cooling by circulation through
external circuits would result in a substantial hold~up of salt =~
and hence fuel -~ outside the core, with attendant cost penilgies.
Alternative methods of cooling have been suggested. Taube 3
proposed cooling the core by Rsiling a volatile component from the
salt mixture. Nelson et al.( considered containing the molten
salt in an assembly of metal thimbles and cooling the outer surface
of the thimbles with a separate coolant such as sodium. Because of
the low thermal conductivity of molten salts it would in this case
be necessary to increase the rate of heat transfer in the salt by
forced circulation. This would be achieved by a small external
circuit of low hold=up. Bettis(5) has suggested an attractive
novel method of cooling molten salt contained in a cylindrical
tank which would comprise the core. A sitreem of lead drops injece
ted in a spray round the periphery of the vessel would circulate
the heated salt from the central core region into the lead spray.
Here heat would be removed from the salt very efficiently because

406
of the high interfacial area between salt and lead, the relative
velocity of lead andsmlt and the absence of a thermal barrier
offered by cladding material. The potential of a fast reactor
based upon this concep? gas been explored in a preliminary study
made by the U.K.A.E.A.(6

Molten chlorides have been regarded as suitable fuels for the
various proposals mentioned above, containing plutonium (as fuel)
and uranium (as internal breeder) with some diluent chloride. The
total heavy atom concentration (typically 20 to 50 mole %) and the
atom ratio U:Pu would be determined by the nuclear physics require—
ments of the particular system under consideration. Each of these
possible applications of molten chlorides as a fast reactor fuel
presents its own individual problems = mechanical and hydrodynamic -
but common to all is the problem of the chemical behaviour of the
chloride fuel salt at temperatures in the region of 550 to 750°C.
Much of the considerable experience gained in the development of
the M.3.R.E. on the behaviour of fluoride salts containing a low
concentration of uranium (ca. 1 mole %) is not applicable to
chloride melts containing a much higher concentration of heavy
elements (20 to 50 mole %). It is therefore the purpose of this
paper to discuss some of the chemical problems which would initially
arise in considering a chloride melt as a fast reactor fuel. These
may be grouped broadly in two categories, the compatibility of salt
with potential container materials and the behaviour of oxide which
may be present initially on surfaces in the system or introduced
adventitiously during operation. For each of these aspects cur-
rently available data are used to make general predictions on the
likely behaviour of the molten salt mixture and to define the
important problem areas. The results of a preliminary chemical
investigation are then presented and discussed.

Predicted Behaviour of Molten Chloride Fuels

Compatibility with container materials

In general molten salts are excellent fluxes for halides and
oxides. There is therefore little possibility of relying upon a
protective layer to achieve low corrosion rates of structural
materials. The primary requirement in achieving corrosion resise
tance must then be to ensure that melt constituents (MCl,) and
components of the container alloy (X) are selected so that all
possible metathetical reactions result in only low concentrations
of the corrosion product (XCly). Even when this condition is fule
filled other processes such as direct dissolution of metal may
give rise to further corrosion., Experience with the M.S5.R.E. has,
however, demonatrat?d that at least with fluorides other processes
are not significant(/), The thermodynamic stability elone proves
to be the most important factor in determining the extent of
corrosion.

407
The reaction between a container metal and a multivalent come
ponent dissolved in the melt may be written in general terms:

MClx(d) + X(s) = XCly(d) + MCl(x_y)(d) 1.

When reduction of the melt component to metal occurs x=y.

The thermodynamic equilibrium constant (KM) for reaction 1 is
expressed in terms of the activity, a;, of each component. Since
at the temperatures of interest most chlorides are either molten
or not far removed from the melting point, it is convenient to
define the pure liquid salt as the standard state of unit activity.
In practice the concentration of a species rather than the activity
is of more practical importance. Experimental data are then conw
veniently correlated by an equilibrium quotient, Q, expressed in
terms of the mole fractiom, x;, of each component. This is related
to the activity by the activity coefficient, Yis DY 84 = YiXj. By
definition, y4 is unity in the pure liquid chlorigde.

The thermodynamic equilibrium constant Ky can be derived from
the known free energies of formation of the chlorides involved in
the reaction. Although the activity coefficient data which are
required to derive the concentrations of corrosion product
chlorides are largely unknown, the calculated values of Ky do
provide a useful initial guide to the relative importance of the
various possible reactions. When considering the many combinations
of components for both the salt and container a more useful
graphical representation of the situation is obtained by consider-
ing that the corrosion reaction takes place in two hypothetical
stages:

Mc1L_(d) = MCl(x_y)(d) + 7/2.C1,(g) 2.

and y/2.012(g) + X(s) = xmy(a) 3.

Expressing in general terms for either a container metal A or a
melt component AClz:

1/z.4(s) +%012(g) = 1/z.AClz(d) Lo

The condition for equilibrium in a multicomponent system is then
that the partial pressure of chlorine, p(Cl,), for all possible
reactions should be constant. This is rela%ed to the free energy
of formation, AFf(AClz), per equivalent of ACl, through the equi~-
librium constant, K,, for reaction 4:

~AF (AC1 ) = RTln K, = 1/z.RT1n(aAc]_z/aA) - $RTIn p(c1,)

408
The chlorine potential, defined as RTln p(Cl,), is then given by:

i

RTIn p(Cl,) = 24F (401 ) + 2/z.RTIn

aAClz/ 2,)

2AFf(Ac1z) + 2/2.RT1n 7A01z +

2/z.RT1n(xAClz/hA) 5.

In Figure 1 the chlorine potential et 1000%K is plotted as a
function of the ratio of the mole fraction of the chloride to the
activity of the metal, assuming thaty (ACl,) = 1.0. If this is
less than unity the oxidised form is more stable in the melt than
predicted and the chlorine potential at a given salt concentration
is displaced to a more negative value. For redox reactions such as

Uc:13(d)+ + %(312(3) = UClL'_(d)

the unit of the abscissa becomes the concentration ratio of the
two species.

Sources of th? gree energy data were the compilitions of Rand
and Kubaschewski(8) for uraniu? csmpounds, of Rand(9) for plutom
nium compounds and of Glassner 10) for the remainder.

From the dilagram the following conclusions may be drawn.

(1) Melts rich in UCl) will be highly corrosive both towards
structural materials such as ferrous and nickel alloys and towards
lead coolant. Even the refractory metals are corroded at the
highest levels of UCl,. Melts rich in U013 rather than UCl, are
therefore to be preferred, wit¥ a limiting chlorine potential at
1000°K of sbout =60 keal.mole™'. Some UCl, is however necessary
to prevent the disproportionation of UCl, with deposition of
uranium. This is especially favoured whén there is present a
metal, such as nickel or lead, which lowers the activity of uranium
by compound formation., Attack of nickel alloy containers by
formation of ¥¥3nium alloys has indeed been reported with melts
rich in UC1 ( « Nevertheless there is a large range of chlorine
potential ="from about ~90 to =60 kcal.mole™' ~ over which corro=
sion of available structural metals should be acceptably low.
During reactor operation it would therefore be necessary to con~
trol the chlorine potential within this range by, for example,
adjusting the concentration ratio of UCl;, and UClzs. This is
anticipated to lie in the range 0.003 to 5%. In this range of
chlorine potential those chlorides suitable for use as diluents =
such as alkali or alkaline earth chlorides =~ are very stable

sible dissolution of the metal in its own halide(12).

(ii) The stebility of PuClz towards disproportionation is
expected to be greater than t of UClze In initisgl stability
tests, melts containing additional UClz in place of PuCl; may
therefore be used, sc avoiding in the early stages of investigation
the complication of working with plutonium.

(iii) The valency assumed by each of the important stable
fission products at any chlorine potential may be predicted; ? few
examples are shown in Figure 1. Ths valency at =70 kcal.mole™',
along with the calculated yields(13 s is shown in Table 1. The
nett valency of the stable fission products is rather less than
the +3 of the fissioned nuclide, implying that as burnup proceeds
the melt will become more oxidising.

8ince with properly chosen container materials the most easily
oxidised material present in the system is UCl; the overall result
would be an increase in the propertion of UClu in the melt. A
burnup of 10% of the heavy atoms would increase the ratio of UCL,
to UCl;z by 6%, which is at the predicted limit for the chlorine
potential. Some method of reducing the UClh content of the melt
will thus be requireds. In the gbsence of an easily oxidisable
constituent such as UCl; any excess chlorine ~ however introduced =
would react with the cohtainer metal. The presence of the redox
system UClz/UCl, therefore provides a buffer against large sudden
changes in the chlorine potential and permits close control within
the range of values in which corrosion of structural materials

is minimised.

An initial experimental programme designed to provide data upon
which an alloy corrosion testing programme would be based should
therefore include:

411
(a) Development of methods of measuring chlorine potential in
the chosen melt.

(b) A measurement of the relative stabilities of UCl; and UCl
in the melt, so defining the position of the UCl,/UClz line on
the Chlorine Potential Diagram. This would involve measuring
the concentration ratio of the two species as a function of
chlorine potential.

(¢) A similar measurement of the concentration of corrosion
product chlorides for selected container metals as a function
of chlorine potential.

Oxide Behaviour

Oxide introduced inadvertently into the fuel salt might inter=
fere with normal operation either by precipitating the oxide of
some component of the salt mixture or by causing enhanced corroe
sion of container metals. Predictions of the behaviour of oxide
in chloride melts are conveniently made by means of a modified
Pourbaix D%agram gimilar to that suggested by Edeleanu and
Littlewood\14), In this diegram the sbscissa is the activity of
some convenient oxide = such as sodium oxide in melts containing
sodium chloride « and the ordinate the chlorine potential; these
may be regarded as independent varigbles. For any element the
diagram is divided into areas in which one of the several possible
phases is stable, e.g. metal at low chlorine potential and low
oxide activity, the chloride at higher chlorine potential and
the oxide at high oxide activity.

The metalemetal chloride boundary is defined by equations 4
and 5 and is independent of oxide activity but dependent upon the
concentration of metal chloride.

The metalmmetal oxide boundary is defined by the reaction:

%Clz(g) +1/z.4(8) + % Ne,0 = 1/%AOZ/2(S) + NaCl(d) 6.

This boundary is dependent upon both chlorine potential and oxide
activity, but is independent of the concentration of metal
chloride. Its position is defined by the free energy change for
reaction 6 (AFG):

20F
6
108 eya 0 = T3 RT * 218 Ppacy * 2/h'1°5(?aoz/2/aa) - log p(Cl,)

Te
Finally the metal chloride ~ metal oxide boundary is defined by

the reaction:

412

1/z.AClz(d) + %Nazo(s) = 1/z.AOZ/2(s) + NaC1l(d) 8.

This boundary is independent of the chlorine potential but depen-
dent upon the activity of the metal chloride ACl_and is related
to the free energy change of reaction 8 GﬁFB) by?

log aNaZO = 77387 * 2/z.Log ngz/E - 2/2.10g gAClz + 2log 8yacl

9.

In the same way boundaries for oxychlorides may be calculated.
When an oxide or oxychloride is formed as a result of the oxida~
tion of some species initially present in reduced form (eg UO
from UCl,) the oxide ~ chloride boundary is clearly dependent
upon chlérine potential.

In Figure 2 are plotted ths boundaries for a selection of
possible salt components and container materials. In drawing
the diagram the activity of the oxide has been assumed to be
unity, so that the metal ~ oxide and the chloride ~ oxide
boundaries define the conditions under which the oxide will
appear as a separate phase. In addition it was assumed that the
activities of' sodium chloride, the metal and the chloride were
also unity. The manner in which the metal = chloride and the
chloride «~ oxide boundaries move when the activity of the metal
chloride is reduced by decade steps is indicated along the metal =~
oxide boundary.

As may be expected the diagram again illustrates the stability,
already seen in the chlorine potential diagram, of container
materials relative to their chlorides. The following deductions
on the behaviour of oxide may be made:

(i) Oxide precipitation. The order in which the components
of & salt mixture will precipitate when the oxXide activity is
increased at any given value of the chlorine potential is readily
deduced. Of all the likely constituents of a fuel melt, uranium
oxide or oxychloride will be the first to precipitate. No sub=
stantial increase in oxide activity is possible until the uranium
has been removed from solution. The composition of the precipi=-
tating phase is expected to depend upon the chlorine potential.
The boundary for UOCl is shown as a broken line since its sta=-
bility is uncertain.

(ii) Plutonium behaviour. Even if UOCl proves to be less
stable than indicated on the diagram, at all chlorine potentials
greater than the lower limit of =90 keal.mole=1 imposed by the
disproportionation of UCl5 uranium is expected to precipitate in
preference to plutonium. “In this case also, in the initial

experiments uranium mey be substituted for plutonium in the melt.

(iii) Oxide removal. In fluoride melts con alglng uranium,
any oxide impurity is very conveniently removed (1 and indeed
analysed = as water vapour by purging with a mixture of H, and HF.
In chloride melts the uranium oxide and H,0/HCl boundaries are so
remote that the removal of oxide with HC1l is quite impraoctical.
Indeed even with high overpressures of HCl1l the melts will be very
prone to hydrolysis by any water vapour present in the system.

A possible alternative method of oxide removal is suggested by
the diagram. The oxides of four elements -~ B, Si, Be and Al =~ are
more stable relative to their chlorides than U0p. Introducing one
of these chlorides into the melt should therefore remove oxide by
preclpltation. All these chlorldes are volatile (boiling points
15° c, 60° Cs 520°C and 480°C respectively). The problems in
introducing corrosive vapours into the melt, of maintaining an
adequate concentration in the melt and of removing the excess
reagent after filtration make the scheme unattractive but not
impossible.

(iv) Protection of uranium from precipitation. In a melt
containing the chlorides of both girconium and uranium at com=
parable activity the two oxides are expected to precipitate at
about the same oxide activity. A similar situation spplies in
the MS.R.E. fluoride fuel salt, where prior precipitation of
2r0, is ensured through ge Mass Action Law by means of a sube~
stantial excess of ZrF (7 With the high concentration of UClL
required in the fast reactor chloride fuel salt such an artifice
is not possible. The four halides discussed above would fulfil
a similar function, but here also their volatility would present
considerable problems in maintaining an adequate concentration in
the melt.

(v) Corrosion. If oxide is added to a melt containing no
chlorides which form stable oxides, the sodium oxide activity
increases to a point = still far removed from saturation in
sodium oxide = at which the oxide of one of the container metals,
Ni, Fe, Mo etc., becomes the stable phase. Oxide impurity in such
melts is notorious in causing corrosion of otherwise resistant
metal containers. The presence of uranium, however, ensures that
the activity of sodium oxide is held at such a low value that the
activity of corrosion product oxides is also extremely low, far
removed from separation as discrete phases. Corrosion of con=
tainer metals by oxide formation is therefore expected to be
negligible and the major single factor in determining the extent
of corrosion remains the chlorine potential of the melt. Thus
the presence of a substantial amount of uranium stabilises the
melt against increases in the oxide activity as well as in
chlorine potential.

4Y¥5
(vi) Oxide solubility. While a uranium-conteining phase is
expected to be the first phase to precipitate on adding oxide to
a chloride fuel salt, the actual concentration of oxide in the
melt at saturation cannot be predicteds This is a most important
aspect, since oxide will inevitably be introduced into the fuel
salt during operation. The solubility of oxide then determines
the rate at which the melt must be reprocessed to remove oxide
for a given rate of oxygen ingress in order to avoid precipitation.

In the initial studies the determination of oxide solubility in
the melt over a range of conditions of chlorine potentisl and
temperature is therefore of prime importance.

Experimental results and discussion

The composition, and in particular the concentrations of
uranium and plutonium, of a chloride fuel salt would be determined
by the details of the reactor design under consideration. For the
present studies a melt of nominal composition NaCl 70 mole%, UCl3
30 mole% was selected as typical of the compositions which might
be emplgyed. The liquidus temperature at this composition is
Sgi %?8)0, close to the single eutectic at 525°C and 33 mole %

Preparation and analysis of salt mixtures

Salt mixtures containing UClz or UCl, are hygroscopic. In the
absence of a convenient method of removing oxide from the melt,
the constituents of salt mixtures were initially prepared so as
to minimise the oxide content. Subsequent handling was carried
out in a glove box flushed with argon dried over a molecular
sieve, Experimental measurements on the molten salts were made
in vacuum=tight vessels, normally of nickel, under a coVer gas
of either argon purified over hot uranium or hydrogen purified
by diffusion through a palladium~silver menbrane.

Sodium chloride wag of analytical grade and, after drying by
slowly heating to 400°C under vacuum, contasined less than 10 ppm
oxygens Uranium tetrachloride was prepared in 50 g. batches by
reaction of finely divided, low-fired (,.00°¢C) U0, with CCl, vapour
at 450 C and purified by vacuum distillation in & horizontal silica
tube at 600 Con to a liner of molybdenum foil located in the cooler
part of the tube. In order to minimise the carry=over of oxide
contamingtion it was found essential to insert a plug of silice
wool, 1 cm. deep, close to the charge of UCl,. After two distile
lations and handling in the dry box the oxide concentration was
less than 0.1 wt.%. This was determined either by inert gas
fusion of 30 mg. samples or by weighing the residue of U0,
remaining after removing the UCl; from & 1 g. sample by vacuum
distillation at 600°C. Uranium trichloride was prepared by
reducing the distilled UCIh.under hydrogen in batches of up to

416
200 g. in a nickel epparatus lined w1th molybdenum foil. The bulk
of the reduction was effected at 550 C. The temperature was
slowly raised to 650°C and maintained until the rate of evolution
of HC1 had dropped to negligible proportions, when the total HCl
evolved corresponded to within Z%Fof the stoichiometric amount.
The oxide level, aga%n determined by inert gas fusion or by vacuum
distillation at 1000°C showed no significant increase over that

of the UCIA feed material.

Stability of UClk in the N’a.Cl:UCl3
The stability of UCl, with respect to UCl; was measured by
determining the chlorine potential in the melt as a function of
the concentration ratio of the two species. The chlorine poten-
tial was measured in two ways, firstly by measurement of the
equilibrium partial pressure of HC1l produced when hydrogen was
passed through the melt and secondly by measuring the potential
of the UCl /UCl redox electrode against a reflerence electrode of
known pote%tlal with respect to the standard chlorine electrode.

amounts of UCl, and UCl the equilibrium quotient for the reduction
reaction (QR) s derive

? e the free energy of formetion of HC1, AFf(HC1) is well
known(17) the difference in the partial molar free energies of
formation of UC and UCl3 in the melt, (UCl#fUClj), is
readily found:

Aff(UC:LLI_-UC%) = AF (HC1) + RT1nQ 1.
It is this free energy function measured in the melt, rather than
the corresponding function for the pure liquids, which is more
approprlately used in correlating the behaviour of UClh in the
melt, as in Figures 1 and 2.

To measure the equilibrium gquotient Qg, hydrogen was passed at
5

e rate of ca. 30 ml.min"1 through sbout 150 g. of melt (ca. 50 ml)
contained in a nickel vessel, previously pickled, dried and fired

417
in hydrogen. The HCl content of the effluent gas from the reaction
vessel was measured by passing the stream through a coulometric
titration cell furnished with a glass pH electrode. At the same
time the volume of hydrogen leaving the coulometric cell during

the titration was accurately measured by means of a climbing
soap~film ges burette. The partial pressure of HCl in the hydrogen
was calculated by correcting to S.T.P., gllowing for the saturated
water vapour pressure in the gas burette and assuming ideal
behaviour of HC1l at the low partial pressures involved (less than
10" atm.).

Even with the dip~line at its maximum depth of 10 cm. the
equilibrium pressure of HCl was not attained. A known partial
pressure of HCl, measured in the usual way, was therefore introe~
duced into the inlet gas stream by passing the hydrogen through a
bed of ferrous chloride held at a predetermined temperature. From
a series of four or more measurements with inlet HCl pressures
both above and below the equilibrium value the required equilibrium
partial pressure was interpolated graphically. The equilibrium
pressures were constant over periods of tens of hours and reprow-
ducible after temperature cycling.

The composition of the salt mixture initially loaded into the
reaction vessel was 70 mole % NaCl with 30 mole % of mixed UCl3
and UClh, typically in the ratio 1.5:1.0. After equilibrium
measurements had been made over a range of temperatures at a
given composition, the UCl, content was reduced by a known amount
by introducing into the melt under argon a weighed sample of
uranium metal (0.5 to 1.0 g.) suspended on a molybdenum wire.

A series of equilibrium measurements were thus obtained over a
range of values of the concentration ratio of UCl, :UCl:, from
which the equilibrium quotient was obtained from %he siope of the
plotted data, Figure 3. Within experimental error the plots at
each temperature extrapolate to zero pyp) at the point anticipated
from the initial composition of the melt.

The derived values of the equilibrium quotient Qg from two
duplicate series of experiments are plotted logarithmically
against reciprocal temperature in Figure 4 and summarised in
Table 2. In the table are also summarised the difference in
the partial molar free energies of formation of UCl, and UCl
and the ratio of their activity coefficients obtained by com=
bining the partial molar free energy difference with the core
responding value for the pure liquids. Within experimental
error the values of the function RTln.y(UClA)/}(UCIB) are
independent of temperature with an average of 4.5 4+ 0.2 kecal.

The redox electrode consisted of & closed silica or alumine
tube 1.2 cm. in diameter containing a small bead of lead with a
molybdenum contact wire. The compartment was filled, through a
hole one millimetre in diameter drilled 6 cm. from the closed
end, by immersion in a bath of melt contained in a nickel vessel.
When filled the electrode compartment was raised sc that the hole
was about 5 mm. above the melt surface. This both defined the
quantity of melt contained in the compartment and essentially
prevented mixing of the melt in the compartment with that in the
bulk. Adequate electrical conductivity wes achieved through the
film of melt adhering to the wall of the tube.

Changes in the concentration of UCl, in the compartment were
produced by electrochemical oxidation %r reduction, the total
charge passing between the compartment and a nickel auxiliary
electrode being measured by an integrating coulometer. Ox%dagion
in dilute solution has been shown to proceed in two stages
electrochemical oxidation of the electrode f'ollowed by a homo~
geneous reaction of the oxidation product with UCl In order to
eliminate excessive loss of molybdenum and contamlgatlon of the
melt with a molybdenum dispersion, current was passed into the
melt through & small pool of lead during oxidation. Conversely,
during reduction the molybdenum wire was removed from the lead

to avoid dissolution of the deposited uranium.

The reference electrode consisted of liquid lead in contact
with a molten mixture of NaCl and PbCly (4L0.0 mole % PbCls,).
This was contained in a closed tube of Mullite in which sodium
ions are mobile; the impedance of the electrode was less than
2.103 ohms. Electrical contact to the lead electrode was made
through an insulated molybdenum wire, as in the redox electrode,
so that the thermal e.m.f. was eliminated., The e.m.fs of the
reference electrode against the standard chlorine electrode was

421
calculated from the free energy of formation of FoCl,(17), the
composition of the melt and the activity coefficient of PbCl, in
NaCl estimated by Lumsden from the phase diagramt19§. This gs in
good agreement with the average value derived from electrochemical
meaaurements(zoxl(O.Blp and 0.73 respectively at 700°C).

The whole cell was flushed continuously with pure argon at a
pressure of 20 mm. Hg above atmospheric pressure, Suitably placed
holes ensured that the hydrostatic pressure was balanced through~
out the electrode compartments. The cell voltage was measured to
+ 0.1 mV on & Solartron Digital Voltmeter and, for convenience,
the output of a Vibron Electrometer was displayed on a strip
recorder., The input impedances of both the instruments (> 407 ohm)
far exceeded the impedance of the cell (2.10° ohm,)

In initial tests the reversibility and stability of the redox
electrode were confirmed using a pair of the electrodes in a
concentration cell. After an oxidation or reduction, gentle
agitation of the wire contact in the compartment produced a stable
e.m.fe within a few minutes; this then remained stable to + 2 mV
for periods of up to several hours., Measurements were normally
made some 30 min. after & concentration change. 4s is to be
expected under equilibrium conditions the e.m.f. was the same
whether the Mo contact was immersed in or removed from the lead
pool.

Attempts were made to measure the am.f. of the cell:

(=) U(#0)/UC1; in NaCl//PbCl, in NaCl/Pb(Mo) (+)

by depositing electrochemically a flew milligrams of uranium on the
Mo wire which was either removed from the lead pool or, in
separate tests, operated in a compartment free of lead. Here a
stable e.n.f, persisted for only a short time, about 10 min.,

and the reproducibility was poor. Uranium is known to react
rapidly with si%ica when both are in contact with a melt conw
taining UCL,(21).

In Figure 5 the observed cell e.m.f. is plotted against the
logarithm of the UCl, :UClz concentration ratio. The slopes of
the plots are summarised and compared with the calculated values
for a onemelectron transfer in Table 3. Alsco summarised are the
standard potentials extrapolated to equal concentrations of UC
and UCl3 and the data used in deriving the difference in partia
molar free energies of formation and the sotivity coefficient
ratio. Within experimental error the difference in excess free
energy, RTln y(UCl,)/¥(UClz), is ipdependent of temperature with
an average of 2,6 + 0.3 kcal.mole™ .

Discussion. Both methpds of measurement show that UClL is less
reactive in the NaCl:UCl3 melt than in the pure liquid. The

extent of stabilisation, as efﬁressed by the excess partial molar
free energy, is 4.5 kcal.mole™! from the hydrogen equilibration
experiments and 2.6 kcal.nole™! from the electrochemical measure=
ments. Remembering the uncertainties in the thermodynamic func-
tions used in deriving these values the agreement is satisfactory.
Since it is more directly derived, the former value is to be
preferred.

The linearity of the plots of Figures 3 and 4 indicates theat
within exparimental error the ratio of the activity coefficients
of UCl), and UCl is independent of melt composition, even though
the m &ér ratios NaCl: UCl3.UCl ranged from 70:29.7:0.03 to
70:17:13. b

From the experimentally determined activity coefficient ratio
the activity coefficient of UCl can be obtained from an estimate
of that for UClz in NaCl. be derived from the liquidus
data for the NaCl:UCl system 6 and estimated from the transient
potentials of the U 13 electrode described above. 2B?dition
the coefficient for the similar trichlorides of cerium
plutonium 22} in NaCl have been reported. The excess partial
molar free energy of formation, RTln y(MClz), extrapolated where

regular solution behaviour, are, in kcal.mole™

424
Over the temperature range 600 to 800°C the average value for
the activity coefficient of UCl3 is therefore 0.25 4 0.10.

Combing these date with the data of Table 2 yields RTln Y(U01L)=
~7.2 % 0.8 kcal.mole'd, with an average gplue for the activity
coefficient of UClh between 600 and 800°C of 0.025 + 0.010,

The low activity coefficient implies that melts containing UCl
will be considerably less oxidising than the simple analysis of
Figure 1 suggests; the experimentally determined relationship is
shown by the broken line. The UCl; /UClz concentration ratio at
the upper limit of chlorine potential of =60 kcal.mole=! is an
order of magnitude higher than the 6% predicted assuming ideal
behaviour in the melt. Alternatively, the concentration of a
divalent corrosion product at any concentration of UClh is a
hundred times less than predicted.

Furthermore the vapour pressure of UCl), over the melt will be
much less that over the pure liquid. At 800°C this is ca.
900 mm. Hg{23), while over the melt at & UClh/UC13 concentration
ratio of 0.1 it is estimated to be 0.7 mm Hg.

Corrosion of Metals

Qualitative observations of the condition of small nickel and
molybdenum components af'ter exposure to the melt under wide ranges
of chlorine potential and oxide content are encouraging; no
evidence of significant attack has been noted.

Measurements are at present being made of the equilibrium
quotient, Qn, for the corrosion reaction between a series of

metals, M, and UCl) dissolved in the N’aCl:UCl3 melt:

M(s) + yUCy, (4) = Mc;y(d) + YUCL,(d); Q; = xMCly(xUCIj/x0014)y

The equilibrium quotient, Q.(Ni), has been measured by deterw
nining the concentration of N1812 in the melt at known values 8f
the concentration ratio of UCl, :UClz. Preliminary data at 650°C
yield Qp(Ni) = 2,10™*. This may be” compared with the thermo-
dynamic equilibrium constant, Kg(Ni), calculated from free energy
data f'or the corresponding reaction involving pure liquid UCl
and UCl; and sglid nickel chloride (NiCl, sublimes without meiting);
Ko(Ni) & 4.10™2, Combining this with thé measured activity co~
efficient ratio for UCl, and UCl, and assuming that y(NiCly) = 1.0
yields a calculated value of Qc(ﬁi) = 3,10+, close to the experie
mental value. Nickel chloride is thus behaving almost ideally in
the melt.

F?r %ead,Qc(Pb) can be estimated from the reported composie
tion(2t) of an equimolar KCl:NaCl melt containing a total of 6% of

425
ur&aium chlorides in equilibrium with metallic lead; Q.(Fb) =
10™, compared with the calculated thermodynamic constant,

Ko(Po) = 10. The activity coefficient ratio of UCIL, and UClz is
probably less than the 0.1 observed in NhCl:UCl3, w?ioh, wit
Y(PbCl,) = 1.0, yields a calculated Q.(Pv) of <"10™!, consistent
with the experimental value. In a&digion, in the electrochemical
oxidation of UClz in the presence of lead the production of
significant amounts of PbCl, would have been shown by a change in
the Nernst slope at high concentirations of UCl,. No deviations
were noted, implying thet Qp(Pb) < 10~!, again consistent with
the calculated value. Lead chloride also appears to be behaving
ideally in the melt.

Oxide Behaviour

The relationships between the various oxide and oxychloride
species which may exist either in solution or as a solid phase in
equilibrium with the melt are likely to be complex (Figure 2).
Since the technologically significant parameter is the ability of
the melt to carry oxide in solution, this has been measured as a
function of temperature and chlorine potential. In separate
experiments the stability of the various possible solid phases is
being investigated.

Determination of Oxide Solubility. This has been carried out by

two independent methods. In one, the first appearance of a pre=
cipitate was observed visually while oxide was slowly added to
the melt as water vapour in a stream of hydrogen. In the other,
small samples of oxide=saturated melt were removed through a
nickel filter and analysed for oxygen by inert gas fusion.

For the controlled precipitation experiments direct observation
of the precipitate is not possible, since the melt appears black
except when viewed through a very thin section due to the intense
absorption and high concentration of UCl,. The point of precipim=
tation was therefore observed by introduéing a lighteguide con-
sisting of a silica rod 8 m.m. in diameter into the melt to within
about 0.5 mm of the optical window which formed the bottom of the
8ilica container. The precipitate then showed as a shadow against
the burgundy red of the thin section of melt. With the lighteguide
raised, water vapour was introduced into the melt in a stream of
hydrogen. The total amount of oxide introduced was found from
both the quantity of water vapour passed into the melt and the
amount of HCl produced by hydrolysis. In addition, the oxide
content was confirmed by analysis of filtered samples of the
saturated melt. No evidence for attack of the silica was found;
over several weeks exposure the optically ground end of the
light=~guide retained its high finish and sharp edges.

In determining the solubility by sampling, ebout 150 g. of
melt was contained in a nickel vessel similar to the one used for

426
the hydrogen purge experiments. Excess oxide was added as lowe
fired UQ, and the UClh content of the melt reduced to a low value
by reduction with uranium suspended on a molybdenum support. At
intervals through the experiment the UCl, content was increased
in appropriate steps by adding known gmounts of UCl, pre~fused
with NaCl to maintain the correct ratio of U:Na. Samples of about
1 8. were removed by gentle suction epplied to a nickel filter
stick closed with a 1.4y filter. This was introduced into the
vessel through an airlock system which also served to transport
the sample to an argon dry-~box without exposure to air. Weighed
fragments, normally in triplicate, were analysed by inert gas
fusion. 4 series of samples taken at intervals during steady
conditions confirmed that equilibrium solubility had been achieved.
Normally after changing the conditions constant values of the
oxide content were obtained after 24 hours.

The data from botg experiments showing tle effect of the UCI)
concentration at 650 C are presented in Figure 6a, where the
solubility is seen to increase with increasing UCl, content.
Were the dissolution process a simple ionisation of UOp to U**
and 0% the addition of U¥* would, from the solubility product,
depress the oxide solubility. Interaction between the ions is
clearly stabilising fhe oxide ion in solution. The formation of
a steble discrete U0“* species in the melt can, however, be exe
cluded, since this would bring about a much greater dependence
of dissolved oxide on UC;A content, as indicated by the broken
line of Figure 6a.

The effect of temperature on the solubility of oxide is
illustrated in Figure 6b. Here the date points lying in the
range of UClL/U01 concentration ratio from 0.0 to 0.15 have
been normalised tb a ratio of 0,05 with the aid of Figure 6a;
data at higher concentrations of UCl, are not includede. The
effect of temperature is small, and is obscured by the scatter
of the data., A full line wigh a negetive temperature coefficient
is drawn between 570 and 650 C, Repeated cbservetions of the
appearance and disappearance of the precipitate during temperze
ture cycling have clearly demonstrated a negative coefficient
over this region for values of the concentration ratio of up to
0.1. Above 650°C the effect of temperature was found to be
slight, and the sign of the coefficient could not be deduced.

The magnitude of the solubility even at the minimum is
acceptably high for reactor operation. The weighted average of
all values at 650°C and low UCl, content is 0.18 wt.%, while the
minimum recorded value is 0.09 %'t.%. With an oxygen inwleakage
of 20 g. per day a reprocessing rate of 10 litres per day (repre=
senting 0.1% per day of the fuel salt in a typical reactor) would
maintain the oxide concentration below 0.03 wt.%,well below the
solubility limit.

Phase Relationships., Experiments have been carried out which,
when combined with free energy data, permit deductions to be made
of the stability of the various possible oxygenw~conteining phases.

UOClp: Combining the exfrasolated data on the decomposition
pressure of UC}A over U0C1,{25) with the vapour pressure over
liquid UClh(23 gives the %hermodynamic equilibrium constant for
the decomposition reaction. From this oconstant, the limiting UCl#
activity above which UOCl, becomes the stable phase is estimated.
Using the measured activity coefficient the corresponding limiting
mole fraction of UCLA in the melt is found to be 0.3 at 580°C and
0.9 at 800°C. Although in none of the oxide solubility experiments
was the concentration of UCl), sufficiently high to produce UOCl,
a8 a separate phase, the inoreased stability of UOCl, in solution
at the lower temperature could account for the observed negative
temperature coefficient of solubility, (Figure 6b). The insta=
bility of solid UOCl, has been confirmed in & series of experiments
in which it was heated in contact with melt in silica ampoules
at 650°C. Even with melts rich in UClh the major oxygenwcontaining
phase found by Xeray analysis was UOp.

UOCl: The formation of small quantitigs of UOCl in the re?%g es
after vacuum distillation of UClz at 1000 C has been reported .
lattice parameters were reported but no %nd%cation of its stability
at high temperatures was given. Gregory 25) has meassured the
pressure of HCL produced on heating UOCl, in hydrogen between 300
and 4500C, At 600°C we have measured a pressure of 5.5 102 atm,
in good agreement with 6.8 102 atm. extrapolated from Gregory's
data. If UOCl is assumed to be the reaction product its free
energy of formation may be calculated; this formed the basis of
the UOCl boundary in Figure 2. An alternative to complete reduce
tion to UOC1l is the more likely partial reduction to U0, and UCl..
The HC1l pressure calculated for partial reduct%gg by combining
date on the vapour pressure of UCl, over UOCl ) d solid UCl
with the pressure of HCl in the reduction of 01L(2§? is 6.5 102,
close to the experimental values, Furthermore Xeray examination
gave no evidence for a UOCL phase after 20% reduction of the
UOClz.

The UOC)l phase is therefore less stable than indicated in
Figure 2; in the solubility measurements no oxide phase other
than U0, has been cbserved by X-ray analysis of the precipitates.

Conclusions

The results of the chemical investigations on molten NaCl:UCl3
are most encouraging for the molten chloride reactor concept.
Measurements of the stability of UClh and the preliminary core
rosion studies both show that in the ‘melt UCl, is less corrosive
than predicted from thermodynamic data. The range of permitted
UCl, concentration is wide, so simplifying the control of chlorine
potential in the fuel salt..

429
The solubility of oxide varies slightly with both temperature
and UCl; concentration. Even at the minimum, the solubility is
sufficient to make it possible to prevent precipitation by prom
cessing the melt at an acceptable rate. At present, however, no
method =~ other than complete reconstitution of the fuel salt =
for removing oxide has been demonstrated.

Abstract

Studies are being made of the corrosion resistance of potential
containment materials to pyrochemical process solvents. Solvents
of interest are alloys of copper, cadmium, zinc, and magnesium
as well as salts of alkaline and alkaline earth halides at system
temperatures from 500-900°C. The materials selection consider-
ations and typical corrosion results are presented for broad
classes of materials such as ferrous alloys, refractory metals,
graphite and ceramics. Refractory metals are generally preferred
because of their low corrosion rates and their inertness to
process solutes,

Introduction

A materials testing program is being conducted at Argonne
National Laboratory in support of laboratory studies and the
engineering development of compact pyrochemical processes.
Corrosion resistant materials are required not only for eventual
commercial application of these processes but also for engineering
and laboratory studies so that meaningful experimental data can
be obtained without significant effects from corrosion. This
paper outlines the materials program and presents results obtained
in specific systems of pyrochemical process interest,

The metal solvents of primary interest are copper, zinc, and
cadmium commonly alloyed with a reducing agent such as magnesium.
(Ternary alloys such as Cd-Mg-Zn are occasionally used because of
desirable chemical properties.) The molten salt solvents are
alkali metal and alkaline earth halides containing an oxidizing
agent such as MgCl,. Other salts are commonly added for specific
purposes, such as melting point adjustment and production of
clean metal/salt interfaces. References 1 and 2 ocutline in greater
detail the reasons for selection of specific metal/salt systems.

Criteria for Materials Selection

The criteria used in selecting structural materials for
pyrochemical process application are somewhat different from
those normally considered in materials selection and consequently
require some amplification, The objective of nearly any materials
program is the selection of a '"corrosion resistant' material. The
acceptance of a material as corrosion resistant is usually based
more on intuition and judgment than on the basis of a set standard,
such as <1 mil per year (mpy) penetration under use conditions.
In this program, for the purposes of our search, a corrosion
resistant material was defined as a material which was attacked
by the metal/salt systems at a sufficiently low rate to permit
adequate service life. This nebulous definition properly implies
that the materials are evaluated on the basis of their probable
process use, as well as on the basis of the observed corrosion
rate. For example, a process vessel, such as a mixer-settler,
which is used in performing process separations will probably
require a service life of the order of 4000 hr, and the reliability
of this vessel is important because it will contain substantial
amounts of plutonium and other fission products. In addition,
this vessel will be used in a remote facility, so that maintenance
or replacement will be expensive. Contrast this vessel with a
process transfer line used to move molten metals and salts from
location to location. Such a line will be used for short time
intervals (minutes) during processing runs and will be put in
place, used, removed, and stored until needed again. A failed

434
line will simply be replaced with a new one. Obviously, a much
higher absolute corrosion rate is acceptable on this line than
on the mixer-settler vessel.

A materials selection criterion somewhat unique to pyrochemical
processing is commonly termed "solution stability", i.e., non-
reaction of the material with solute plutonium, uranium, or other
desired product. This criterion is often the basis for rejection
of materials which otherwise possess good corrosion resistance.

For example, graphite is not attacked by molten zinc-magnesium/
halide salt systems. Yet, when solute uranium or plutonium metals
are added, they have high activities in solution and react with the
graphite to form carbides. These carbide reaction products are
not soluble in either the metal or salt phases and consequently

are lost from the desired process streams. If a recovery process
is not utilized this loss (since the carbides will now be contained
in process waste streams) increases overall processing losses and,
seriously affects the process economics.

In the economic evaluation of a particular type of processing
vessel, many factors other than initial cost must be considered.
These vessels will be used in a remote facility and consequently
maintenance and replacement will be expensive. Disposal of
equipment will not be routine because these vessels will have been
used to contain highly radiocactive materials, Decontamination and
disposal of highly radiocactive equipment is also a part of overall
vessel operating cost. It can be seen then that vessel A, initially
costing more than vessel B but with a longer service lifetime,
could be more economical to the process.

The physical properties of the materials at elevated temper-
atures are obviously important since the materials will be used
in the 600-900°C temperature range. Our experience has been,
however, that strength of materials is seldom a serious problem
since the process operates almost entirely at pressures near
atmospheric and most vessel designs do not require high strength.
More important are properties such as ductility and thermal
expansion, which must be considered in vessel design. Stress
corrosion has been troublesome on some materials because of the
presence of the high temperature chloride salt and this factor
should be considered in materials selection.

Another physical property consideration that is important,
especlally for ceramics, concerns both porosity and thermal
shock resistance. For example, a corrosion resistant ceramic may
be too porous to contain the molten salt at processing temperatures.
Our experience with silicon carbide in this regard is worthy of
mention. Tests of commercial #ilicon carbide indicated good
corrosion resistance but unacceptable porosity since a molten

435
salt would "weep" through the crucible wall. A high density
silicon carbide was obtained and, although it successfully con-
tained the molten salt, its higher density rendered it susceptible
to thermal shock failure, which did not occur in the lower density
product.

One common feature of the solvent systems in use is that they
are good solvents for a wide variety of materials and consequently
are also corrosive to a wide variety of containment materials. This
solubility must constantly be kept in mind because a vessel may
perform well in laboratory experiments where the extent of corrosion
is limited by the small volume of solvent but be attacked in process
use when the solvents are constantly changed or replenished.

Mass transfer occurring under either a temperature or concen-
tration gradient can also cause rapid vessel degradation, so the
material selected must be resistant to these effects under process
conditions.

The materials selected as a result of this investigation must
eventually be fabricated into process equipment items. The
methods that would be used in production of the final product
should be tested in the materials program. Many materials, such
as tungsten, molybdenum, alumina, calcia, beryllia, and vitreous
carbon can be routinely fabricated into small vessels and parts
suitable for laboratory studies. However, the production of
large parts suitable for commercial application creates a large
gamut of engineering problems, Therefore, in this program small
equipment was often fabricated, not by the most efficient method
for the particular vessel, but by a method ultimately applicable
to larger sizes.

The final test of all materials selected for process appli-
cation is their ability to perform well under actual process
conditions. Consequently, the materials program initially
measures corrosion rates, and investigates solution stability
and mass transfer effects, but, ideally, each material selected
is fabricated into prototype process vessels and tested under
actual use conditions.

It would seem then, that with all these criteria, no material
would meet all the requirements for economical process vessels
but, fortunately, such is not the case, as we shall show in the
subsequent sections. It is true, however, that a single material
probably cannot be used for all applications so that a variety
of materials would be used in any commercial application of these
processes.

436
Types of Corrosion Tests

In this program the five techniques used to obtain corrosion
data at elevated temperatures were: (1) rotated isothermal
capsules, (2) '"corrosion agitators", (3) stirred crucibles (which
include most cf the solution stability tests), (4) thermal-con-
vection loops, and (5) prototype vessel testing. Fach technique
will be described separately.

Isothermal Capsule Tests

Rotated isothermal capsule tests are performed by exposing the
material under test to an isothermal molten metal/salt system con-
tained in a small tantalum capsule as shown in Figure 1. The
tantalum capsule is then charged with a sample (usually cut from
sheet material) and an appropriate quantity of the metal and salt
of interest. After seal welding, the tantalum capsule is enclosed
in a welded capsule (type 304 stainless steel) to protect the
tantalum from air oxidation during testing. The welding of both
capsules is done in argon to provide an inert atmosphere inside
the capsules and also to obtain a sound weld in the tantalum
capsule. Tantalum was selected as the material for the primary
corrosion capsule because prior experience had shown it to be
resistant to the metal/salt systems of interest. These tests
showed, however, that tantalum is embrittled by exposure to the
molten salt phase.

The tests are begun by placing 8 to 12 assembled capsules in
a type 310 stainless steel secondary tube containing a static
argon atmosphere. Two of these secondary tubes are then placed
in resistance-heated furnaces assembled into a rocking furnace.
The rocking furnace rotates 180° and returns to its original
position to expose the entire coupon to both metal and salt.
The capsules are maintained for about 200 consecutive hours at
the desired test temperature.

The isothermal capsule tests are used as preliminary screening
tests because they are convenient and permit simultaneous testing
of many samples. Effects such as high solubility of the potential
construction materials and intergranular or transgranular attack
are readily apparent. The results of these tests are not con-
sidered conclusive for those materials which appeared promising,
however, because this type of test has several inherent weaknesses.
Effects caused by a low sample material solubility are not
apparent because of the small volume of corrodent since the
corrodent saturates with the component and further dissolution
ceases. This effect would be of importance if the material were
used as a process vessel since the ratio of the volume of

effects such as mass transport and solution stability are not
tested in the capsule tests, Therefore, those materials which
appeared promising after the isothermal capsule tests are sub-
jected to "corrosion agitator tests' and later to solution
stability tests.

Corrosion Agitator Tests

A typlcal corrosion agitator is shown in Fig. 2. 1In these
tests, coupons of the test material are affixed with tungsten
wire to a molybdenum-30 wt % tungsten shaft (again chosen on the
basis of experience). Four coupons are placed on the shaft so
that each 1s exposed to a different condition in the system. One
coupon is located in the metal phase, one at the initial (quiescent)
location of the metal/salt interface, one in the salt phase, and
one in the vapor phase. This agitator is rotated in the molten
metal/salt system for varying times up to 200 hr. At the end
of the test the metal and salt phases are poured off and the
coupons are allowed to drip clean and cool before they are removed
and examined. This type of test provides a dynmamic system in which
non-adherent reaction films are removed by local turbulence. Most
of the promising materials are tested as corrosion agitators--
except materials such as graphite and ceramics whose physical
properties do not lend themselves to this type test. These tests
are usually indicative of the ultimate utility of a material of
construction,

Crucible Tests

Those materials which appear promising after the initial series
of tests are fabricated into crucibles for testing under '"simulated
use'" conditions in which they are tested in an environment
approximating that expected in process application, Similar
crucible tests are performed with graphite, cast iron and the
other materials which do not lend themselves to coupon testing,
Crucible tests are performed in a tilt-pour furnace which is
shown in Fig, 3. The crucibles used are usually about 5 in. in
diameter and 10 in., high. For these tests the metal and salt
are loaded intc a crucible, heated to the desired temperature,
and agitated for times up to 200 hr., At the end of this peried
the agitator is withdrawn from the melt and the entire furnace
assembly 1s tilted 90° to allow the molten metal and salt to
pour into a graphite mold. The furnace is disassembled to allow
inspection of the now-empty crucible,

Solution Stability Tests

Materials which demonstrate acceptably low corrosion rates in
the capsule, agitator and crucible tests are further tested to
determine 1f the containment material 1is inert to the dissolved
uranium and plutonium that would be contained under process con-~
ditioms.

The material is normally fabricated into crucibles similar to
those in the tests just described. The crucible is charged with
an appropriate metal-salt mixture and heated to a constant temper-
ature, The crucible contents are stirred for about 1 hr and, at
that time, uranium or plutonium metal i1s added. The metal-salt
mixture is then equilibrated, with stirring, for times of 50 to
200 hr, during which time filtered samples of both the metal and
salt phases are taken for analysis of uranium or plutonium content.
If the solutions are stable these analyses remain constant but,
if a solution instability is present, the uranium or plutonium
analyses decrease during the time of the run. If an instability
exists, samples of precipitates and of the metal and salt phases
at probable precipitate locations are taken at the end of the run
to assist in identifying the probable cause. Additional details
of the sampling procedures and precautions are contained in an
article by Winsch (4.

Thermal Convection Loop Test

Mass transfer effects under a thermal or concentration gradient
are not adequately tested in isothermal capsule, corrosion agitater,
or agitated crucible corrosion tests. In an effort to develop a
test to provide this information a two-phase thermal convection
loop was operated. This loop was constructed of type 304 stalnless
steel and was successfully operated to demonstrate the design,
thermal control, and operation of a system which would provide
mass transport information.

A gchematic diagram of the loop 1s shown in Fig. 4. The general
loop configurationis a "figure eight''. The lower loop contains
molten metal and the upper loop contains molten salt. The hori-
zontal leg common to both the upper and lower loops contains both
metal and salt which flow countercurrently during operation. The
loop is charged with molten metal and salt from an overhead fill-
tank. The location of the metal/salt interface in the horizontal
leg was determined by X-ray pictures of the operating loop. This
technique was not very satisfactory for determining the salt/
atmosphere interface; therefore, this interface was determined
by a "dip-stick' technique.

Temperature control was maintained by the use of four
independent heater circuits. One circuit heated the metal loop
and a second heated the salt loop to maintain the charge materials
at a uniform temperature in the molten state. The other two
circuits heated the metal and salt "hot' legs to elevated temper-
atures thereby providing the thermal gradients necessary for
thermal convection flow. When the loop was in operation about
80% of the power was introduced through the hot leg heaters. At
the conclusion of the run the metal and salt were frozen in place
and the loop was sectioned for metallographic and chemical exami-
nation.

Prototype Vessel Testing

Materials which successfully complete all previous phases of
testing are then fabricated into vessels which are used in
laboratory and engineering investigations of the process.(s) At
the completion of an experimental series these vessels are examined
either destructively or non-destructively to determine their
behavior under actual processing conditions.

Corrosion Mechanisms

Most of the corrosion that occurs in metallic specimens exposed
to these metal/salt systems is the result of dissolution of the
material in the liquid metal. 1In most cases the material has
some solubility in the liquid metal and slowly dissolves until an
equilibrium condition is reached. Transgranular attack is
relatively uncommon. Intergranular attack is not uncommon, however,
and is usually the result of preferential solubility of elements
concentrated at the grain boundaries or of metal phase reaction
with grain boundary precipitates. Uccasionally a metal phase
inclusion, such as carbon, presents a desired locatior for attack.

The salt produces several different correosion effects on
metallic specimens. If the salt is not dry, materials such as
oxychlorides, hydrogen and chlorine may be present and, at the
high process temperatures, will cause serious corrosion. For
this reason the salt used in these runs is purified by contact
with a Mg-33.5 at.% Cd alloy at 600°C for 24 hr before use to
remove any water present, This purification process is outlined
in Ref. 6. The salt phase can also cause dissolution of socluble
metallic specimens and, if the distribution coefficient favors
transport of the material to the metal phase, this dissolution
can continue beyond the apparent solubility limit.

The salt phase also causes corrosion by embrittlement of some

444
materials and alloys. The nature and cause of this embrittlement

is largely unknown but has the effect of seriously reducing the
ductility of some materials, especially the refractory metals. This
same effect may be responsible for the few cases of stress corrosion
that have been observed.

In addition to these effects, the presence of magneésium, a good
reducing agent, in the metal phase is the cause of some corrosion,
especially of ceramic materials, such as alumina, which can be
reduced by magnesium. The presence of magnesium also accentuates
some metallic corrosion especially in cases where corrosion
resistance is normally obtained through the presence of a pro-
tective oxide film which is subsequently reduced in the presence
of magnesium.

Results of Tests Performed

The results obtained in this program are discussed in terms of
general experience with different classes of materials rather than
measured corrosion rates in specific systems, since these results
are avallable elsewhere(7’8!9§ and are not of great general Interest.
Typical results are presented to exemplify trends and indicate
types of problems encountered.

The reported corrosion rates are conservative and are probably
higher than those that would be experienced in actual service.
These rates were obtained from data taken in short times (usually
<200 hr) and converted to an annual rate for presentation on a
uniform basis., This resulted, therefore, in multiplying the
observed corrosion by factors of 40 to 80. Small errors in
experimental measurements would then result in large errors of
annual corrosion rates. In taking the experimental data a
conservative approach is used to prevent underestimating the
annual corrosion rate., In samples of varying degrees of corrosion
the '"worst case'" 1s usually taken, except for those cases in
which this condition is obviously unrealistic. Other factors such
as protective film formation or saturation of the metal/salt
system with a soluble constituent also decrease the annual corrosion
rate that would be obtained in actual service, Tests are also
usually made at temperatures slightly higher (,,50°C) than those
expected in process use in order to accentuate the corrosive
effects of the solvent.

Several techniques are used to determine the extent of corrosioen.
These include: (1) metallographic examination of the specimens
after exposure to the liquid metal/molten salt systems, (2) size
changes of the metal coupons, (3) physical property measurements
before and after exposure, (4) chemical analysis of the metal and

445
salt phases after sample exposure, and (5) electron-probe microscopy
and X-ray diffraction analysis of reaction layers and precipitated
solids.

Ferrous Alloys

Austenitic Stainless Steels

Austenitic stainless steels containing appreciable concentrations
of nickel or manganese are not good containment materials for the
systems studied. Nickel is soluble in copper, zinc, cadmium,
and magnesium, and deterioration of the steel through nickel
leaching occurs. These steels, however, are normally acceptable
containment materials for a purified salt in the absence of a metal
phase.

Ferritic Stainless Steels

Those steels with a low nickel and high chromium content (such
as type 405) are much more corrosion resistant to the proposed
metal/salt systems than austenitic stainless steels. Neither
chromium nor iron is highly soluble in the metal phases. In general
the corrosion resistance increases with increased chromium content
of the steel. Increased magnesium concentration in the molten
metal usually makes the system less corrosive. Ferritic steels
are acceptable containment materials for high magnesium content
alloys and for the molten salts. Solution stability must be
considered for process application utilizing these steels, however,
since both UgFe and UFe; have been identified as forming in a
Cu-20.8 at. % Mg-0.5 at. % U/MgCl, system exposed at 850°C to a
CB-30 stainless steel crucible. The thermal convection loop
studies also indicated a tendency for both chromium and iron to
mass transport under a thermal gradient, and this tendency should
be taken into consideration in proposed applications. The ferritic
stainless steels are more difficult to fabricate than the austenitic
stainless steels primarily because of poorer welding properties.
Consequently, fabrication methods not requiring welding (such as
casting) are recommended. Croloy 16-1 is a ferritic steel
available as pipe which has been used successfully as a transfer
line in copper-magnesium systems.

Cast Iron, Carbon Steel, and Low Alloy Steel

These materials are intermediate in corrosion resistance between
the austenitic and ferritic stainless steels but, in many cases,
do not possess sufficient strength for use at the elevated temper-
atures of process interest. They are also susceptible to

tain a Cu-20.8 at. % Mg-0.5 at. % U/MgCl, system at 850°C.

tests with various ferrous alloys.

These results show that at temperatures as high as 600°C steels
are only slowly corroded by Cu-Mg alloys but an increase in
temperature to 800°C significantly increases the corrosion rate.
Neither copper nor cadmium base systems are highly corrosive but
the addition of zinc in appreciable concentrations precludes
containment of these materials in ferrous alloys. In general
the ferritic type 405 steel is the most corrosion resistant.

Refractory Metals

The refractory metals tungsten, tantalum, niobium, molybdenum,
rhenium and various alloy combinations, in general, possess good
corrosion resistance to the proposed process systems. This
corrosion resistance is a result of their low solubility in the
process systems and is not directly related to their common

447
application of high temperature service. The problems most often
encountered in their application concern (1) the fabrication of
refractory metal parts and (2) embrittlement of the more ductile
materials, tantalum and niobium, by the molten salts, hydrogen and
oxygen. The discussions in this section are related to recent
data obtained in the Cu-Mg system since this and the Cd-Mg system
are very similar. The Zn-Mg system is substantially more corrosive
to most of these materials and their utility in Zn-Mg systems was
the subject of a previous paper. 7) Table 2 presents corrosion
rates of refractory metals exposed to Cu-Mg/halide salt systems.
These results were obtained from weight loss and metallographic
examination studies. Although they indicate little corrosion,
they do not present the entire corrosion picture. Both tantalum
and niobium were embrittled by this exposure but this effect is
not apparent from either of the forementioned tests. This
embrittlement would be of significance in service application
because process vessels would lose ductility, and the probabllity
of failure through mechanical or thermal shock would increase.
Table 3 presents the results of tests performed to obtain
quantitative data on this embrittlement. The materials were
exposed as corrosion agitators, at 650°C to a MgClz—BO mol 7
NaC1l-20 mol % KC1l salt for 196-197 hr. Tantalum appears to be
more corrosion resistant to the molten salt than niobium but

also appears more susceptible to embrittlement. The cause and
quantitative effect of the embrittlement on the two metals is
currently under investigation.

Tungsten appears virtually corrosion resistant to this system
and is routinely used in laboratory and engineering process
investigations; no deleterious effects have been observed after
3 or 4 years of service of some vessels., Tungsten is difficult
to fabricate into many desired shapes but crucibles as large as
10 in. ID x 20 in. high have been used. Various crucible fabri-
cation techniques have been tried and these results are discussed
elsewhere, (10) A fabrication technique applicable to a wide
variety of shapes is now under investigation. This technique
involves the vapor deposition of a tungsten coating on a graphite
substrate and, to date, the results have been encouraging.

Molybdenum is also difficult to fabricate into intricate shapes
and, since our results indicate that tungsten is more corrosion
resistant, our effort has been directed primarily toward tungsten
shapes. A notable exception is the Mo-30 wt Z W alloy. This
alloy i1s machinable and is routinely used for agitators, exposed

449
transfer line parts, and other applications requiring machined
parts. The material is only slowly attacked in process service
(perhaps about 20 mpy) and has given excellent service.

Graphite and Vitreous Carbon

Two major problems are encountered when graphite 1s used as a
containment material for pyrochemical processes: (1) coanventional
grades of graphite are too porous to contain the molten salt and
(2) solute uranium and plutonium react with graphite to form
insoluble carbides, The porosity problem is easily solved by
the uge of premium grades of graphite with a higher demsity. It
has been our experience that a graphite density of about 1.72 g/cc
(theoretical density, 2.25 g/cc) or higher is usually sufficient
to contain the molten salt. Graphites of this density are
commercially available at a modest increase in cost over conven-
tional graphite,

Several attempts have been made to protect the graphite surface
from reaction with the solute uranium and plutonium. The major
problem encountered i1s matching thermal expansion of the coating
with that of the graphite. The most successful attempts to date
have been with tungsten and with silicon carbide, both of whose
thermal expansion coefficients (2.2 x 106 in./in./°F) are very
close to graphite (vl to 4 x 10=6 in,/in./°F depending upon
grain orientation of graphite). Care must be taken to obtain a
graphite with an isotropic thermal expansion coefficient. A
graphite crucible coated with a 0.030 in. coating of tungsten
deposited by vapor deposition is now under test and results are
encouraging. The coating applied by this technique is very
nearly 100% of theoretical density. A small crucible (vl in. ID
x 2 in. high) coated with flame-sprayed silicon carbide was also
used very successfully; but, when attempts were made to produce
a larger crucible (6 in. ID x 10 in, high), the coating was not
dense enough to protect the graphite.

Vitreous carbon was used very successfully in small scale
tests and was not generally wet by the metal/salt systems in
times up to 200 hr, Attempts to scale these crucibles up to
larger sizes were unsuccessful because of the fragile nature of
the material and because the maximum available wall thickness
was 0.1 in, Crucibles (about 4 in. ID x 8 in., high) were
fabricated but were found to be easily broken in service.

Silicon Carbide and Alumina

Silicon carbide is inert to the process solutions but is not
usable because the density of fabricated parts is too low to

450
adequately contain the molten salts., A special high-density

grade of silicon carbide was obtained and tested and, although

its density was sufficient to contain the molten salt, three of
three crucibles failed in services from what appeared to be thermal
shock.

Alumina has been used in many experimental investigations but
is not completely immune to attack. Alumina is reduced by molten
magnesium but at our magnesium concentrations of interest, the
kinetics of the reduction are slow and several hundred hours
exposure are readily obtainable. The reduction of alumina can
also cause solution stability problems., A metallic film adhering
to the wall of an alumina crucible exposed to a Cu-20.8 at. %
Mg-0.5 at. % U/MgCl, melt after 144 hr at 850°C was found to be
nearly pure UAl,. %ther ceramics such as boron nitride, whose
B O3 content is reduced by magnesium,and zirconia and magnesia,
wﬁich are porous to the salt, have alsoc proved unsuitable,

Conclusions

Pyrochemical processes for the purification of discharged
reactor fuels require suitable containment materials for a variety
of molten metal and salt systems. Although the problems of
meeting these requirements are difficult, materials are available
for the systems of interest. Ferrous alloys are useful in process
equipment in those steps where solute uranium and plutonium are
not present and for applications requiring short-term exposure.
Refractory metals, especially tungsten, tantalum, and niobium,
are useful throughout the process. Tungsten presents fabrication
problems but if the embrittlement problem with tantalum and
niobium can be solved, they should be usable for nearly all process
equipment. Ceramics have process utility, but their usefulness
is limited to the higher density products that are resistant
to molten magnesium,

CORROSION OF A 1LOW ALLOY STEEL

IN A SIMULATED LIQUID-METAL-FUEL REACTOR MIXTURE*

Abstract

An isothermal dynamic testing technique was used to investigate
the corrosion of 2%7 chromium - 1% molybdenum alloy steel first by
pure liquid lead-bismuth eutectic (55.5%Bi) and then by zirconium-
inhibited eutectic to which elements had been added to simulate
those fission products which would be found in a liquid-metal
fueled reactor.

When exposed to the eutectic alone the steel was found to be
highly resistant to attack up to temperatures of about 700°C.
Above 700°C the degree of attack increased with temperature until
at 900°C only long fingers of ferrite remained at the metal surface
in place of the original material.

In tests with the simulated reactor mixture inhibited with
zirconium, the temperature was raised to about 800°C before
corrosion was detected. The mixture consisted of the eutectic plus
Zr, U, Mg, Mo, Ce, Nd, and La as additives. Above 800°C the same
increase in attack with temperature as occurred with the pure
eutectic was observed.

Introduction

Low-melting metals and alloys show promise as nuclear reactor
coolants or fuel carriers because of their excellent heat transfer
characteristics, low vapor pressure, frequent low neutron capture
cross section and resistance to irradiation. Applications have
been limited, however, because they corrode most container materials
at elevated temperatures.

To overcome this limitation, investigators have turned to certain
additives, termed iInhibitors, which are effective in reducing
corrosion through formation of impervious surface films on the con-
tainer materials at the liquid metal interface. The use of such
inhibitors to reduce corrosion has been investigated for many low-
melting heavy metals such as mercury, lead, bismuth and the lead-
bismuth eutectic. A pioneering effort was that of Nerad (1) and
his assoclates at the General Electric Company when they developed
the mercury boiler. It was found that as little as 1 ppm of
titanium or zirconium added to the magnesium-deoxidized mercury
reduced the attack of ferrous alloys to a negligible level.

More recently (1954) Gurinsky, et al. (2) reported that additioms
of Mg and Zr to uranium-bismuth solutions substantially reduced the
corrosion of 2%% Cr - 1% Mo alloy steel. Later, in 1956, Miller
and Weeks (3) discovered that Zr and Ti additions to liquid Bi
inhibited the corrosion of steels by the formation of protective
deposits of ZrN or TiN.

Inhibition of corrosion of low alloy steels by uranium-bismuth
solutions through Zr addition and formation of a surface film of
ZrN and/or ZrC was reported in 1960 by Weeks and Klamut (4).
Whether a nitride or carbide film formed was determined by the
relative activities of the carbon and nitrogen in the steel.

Romano et al. (5) summarized in 1963 the data obtained from more
than 100 low alloy steel thermal convection loops which contained
zirconium-inhibited bismuth and uranium~bismuth solutions. Their
conclusions confirmed the corrosion resistance of the low alloy
steels to zirconium~inhibited uranium~bismuth solutions.

Working in this Laboratory in 1958 Clifford (6) completed a
series of experiments with the lead-bismuth eutectic which led to
selection of 2%7% Cr - 1% Mo alloy steel and type 430 stainless steel
as container materials most suitable up to 700°C. Above this
temperature none of the ferritic steels examined were satisfactory.
In 1960 Stachura (7) discovered that Zr concentrations as low as
50 ppm effectively inhibited corrosion of 2%% Cr - 1% Mo steel by
the eutectic. X-ray diffraction studies suggested the formation of
a protective film of ZrN.

454
The purpose of this study was to corroborate the work of previous
investigators who worked with the zirconium-inhibited eutectic and
to determine how corrosion inhibition might be affected by those
elements which would be present in the liquid metal if it were being
used in a liquid metal fueled reactor.

Testing Procedure

The corrosion tests were conducted in two spinner units such as
that shown in Figure 1. The portion of each unit which contained
the liquid metal bath was placed in the open core of a cylindrical
resistance furnace. The alloy steel specimens used were 4-inch
lengths of schedule 40 steel pipe. A specimen to be tested was
mounted at the end of a shaft which was rotated at 200 rpm while
the specimen was immersed about 2 inches in the liquid metal.
Purified argon at 16 psia pressure was used as an inert cover gas.

Each unit was provided with an air lock through which a graphite
sample crucible was lowered to withdraw samples of the liquid metal
at 12-hour intervals throughout the 96-hour test period used in all
runs. This period was found to be about the minimum required for
buildup of a detectable level of corrosion products in the liquid
metal In those cases where significant corrosion did occur. Figure
2 is a photograph of the two units as they were installed in the
laboratory.

In all tests the metal bath samples were analyzed for Fe and Cr
content. In addition each pipe specimen was cut perpendicular to
the axis and examined metallographically. In the inhibited runs
powder x-ray diffraction patterns were taken of the surface scrap-
ings of the steel specimens in order to determine the presence of
any surface films in which Zr or the other additives might be found.

The overall investigation consisted of two series of corrosion
tests in which all pipe specimens were 2%% Cr - 1% Mo alloy steel.
In the first series pure lead-bismuth eutectic (SS.SiWBi) was used
as the corrodent; in the second the corrodent was a simulated
reactor mixture inhibited with Zr. The mixture consisted of the
eutectic plus 100 ppm Zr, 1000 ppm U, 300 ppm Mg, 1 ppm Mo, Nd and
La, and 2 ppm Ce. The Mg served as a deoxidant to prevent Zr and
the other additives from being oxidized from solution. The tempera-
ture (600°C - 900°C) was held constant throughout each run.

Results
Tests with the Lead-Bismuth Eutectic

The maximum Fe and Cr concentrations detected during the 96-hour
tests in pure lead-bismuth eutectic are showm in Figure 3. The
logarithm of corrosion product concentration is plotted against the
reciprocal of absolute temperature. Each point represents one 96-
hour run.

The selectivity of the lead-bismuth eutectic for Cr can be
illustrated by comparing the fraction of Cr in the original alloy
with the fraction of Cr as a corrosion product in the liquid melt.
Referring to Figure 3, maximum amounts of Fe and Cr detected in the
melt during an 800°C test are 62 and 6 ppm respectively. The weight
fraction of Cr in the alloy is given in Table T as 0.02Z. If all
corrosion products except Fe and Cr are neglected, the fraction of
Cr in the corrosion products is 0.088. The ratio of the two
fractions, Cr in the corrosion products to Or in the steel is
approximately 4.0. Since a value of unity would correspond to a
transfer of Cr to the melt roughly proportional to its concentra-
tion in the steel, the selectivity for Cr by uninhibited lead-
bismuth eutectic is readily evident.

Tests with the Simulated Reactor Mixture

The maximum Fe and Cr concentrations detected in the melt during
the runs with the simulated reactor mixture are givem in Table III,
as are the correspounding concentrations for the pure eutectic. The
effectiveness of Zr as an inhibitor in the simulated reactor mixture
at temperatures less than 900°C can be illustrated by comparing the
net corrosion product concentrations in the mixture with those in
the pure eutectic. At 800°C approximately 30 times less Fe and at
least 6 times less Cr were detected in the inhibited mixture than
in the pure eutectic. Below 800°C the concentrations are too low
to be meaningful and even at 800°C do not allow conclusions about
the selectivity of the mixture for Cr.

At 900°C the corrosion product concentrations for the reactor
mixture are essentially the same as those for the pure, uninhibited
eutectic. This suggests that in the vicinity of 900°C there is
some breakdown in the inhibiting effect of the zirconium.
Metallographic examination was used to confirm this.

Metallographic Examination of the Test Specimens

Photomicrographs were prepared of the inside and outside edges
of the pipe specimens which had been exposed to the pure lead-
bismuth eutectic and to the simulated reactor mixture. They served
to illustrate the mechanism of attack of the steel by the liquid
metals and the increasing severity of attack with temperature.

Figure 4 is of the outside edge of a control specimen and shows
the condition of the pipe surface prior to exposure to the liquid
metals. Figure 5 is a corresponding photomicrograph of a specimen
tested at 700°C in the pure eutectic. The microstructure is not
appreciably altered except for some increase in grain size over
that of the control specimen.

The first indication of intergranular attack by the pure eutectic
appeared at 750°C as shown in Figure 6. At this temperature the
attack is advanced to the point where whole grains are detached
from the specimen gurface. The increase in severity of attack with
temperature (850° and 900°C) 1s evident from Figures 7 and 8a. The
portion of the specimens shown in these photomicrographs consists
of ferrite (light areas) and bainite, containing small granules of
carbide, and small regions of martensite (dark areas). These
features are shown more clearly in greater magnification in Figure
8b. A decarburized zone at the surface of these higher temperature
specimens is also evident. At 900°C (Figure 8a) the attack is so
severe that only long fingers of ferrite remain at the surface in
place of the original material.

The specimen tested at 700°C in the simulated reactor mixture is
ghowm in Figure 9 and exhibits little alteration in microstructure.

At 800°C (Figure 10) no intergranular attack is evident as contrasted
to Figure 6 where such attack is evident following exposure to the
non-inhibited eutectic.

At 900°C (Figure 11) the specimen exposed to the mixture exhibits
essentially the same microstructure as that tested at 900°C in the
pure eutectic, as might have been predicted from the liquid metal
bath analyses. At 900°C or between 800°C and 900°C some breakdown
in the inhibition process occurs resulting in corrosive attack
similar to that in the uninhibited case.

The authors feel that the increase in corrosion resistance in
the steel in the simulated reactor mixture is likely due to the
formation of impervious protective film such as ZrN or ZrC on the
surface of the steel. The breakdown in the inhibition process
could also be explained by a cracking or a spalling of this film,
or dissolution of the film by the metal substrate at high tempera-
tures. Such protective films have been reported by other
investigators but could not be totally confirmed in this case by
the x-ray diffraction technique used.

Conclusions

Under dynamic isothermal conditions, Zr has been shown to be an
effective inhibitor to corrosion of 2%% Cr - 1% Mo alloy steel by
a simulated lead-bismuth eutectic-based reactor mixture. Zirconium
concentrations of 100 ppm are effective at temperatures up to about
800°C. The increase in corrosion resistance is thought to be due
to the formation of a protective film of ZrN or ZrC on the steel
surface.

The degree of attack increases with temperature and at about
900°C the Zr is no longer effective. The mechanism of attack at
this temperature is the same in pure lead-bismuth eutectic and in
the zirconium-inhibited simulated reactor mixture. The mechanism
appears to consist of intergranular pemetration coupled with a
solution and reprecipitation phenomena such as that observed in a
selective leaching process.

The relevance of fundamental mass transfer studies of
high temperature 1lnorganic liquid-liquid extraction sys-
tems to the design of pyrochemical reprocessing contactors
is discussed, Particular attention is paid to the applic-
ability of theoretical models and correlations developed
from low temperature aqueous-organic systems to liquid
metals and fused salts. The measurement and prediction

of viscosities and diffusivities in ligquid metals are re-

I. Studies of Interphase Mass Transfer
in Pyrochemical Systems

Development of a practical high temperature fuel re-
processing technique can be divided into three steps:

(1) Demonstration of thermodynamic feasibdility

(2) Analysis of the kinetic aspects of the process

(3) Development of appropriate phase contacting devices

Since the beginning of interest in this field in the
1950's, an impressive quantity of information on the chem-
ical and physical equilibria associliated with a wide vari-
ety of high-temperature non-aqueous systems has been accu-
mulated. As potential processes were identified, work on
the development of contacting equipment was initiated(1),
While device testing provides some information on the
kinetics of the transfer process (e.g., heights of a trans-
fer unit in fused salt-1iquid metal packed columns), rel-
atively little work has been performed on the fundamental
aspects of mass transfer in non-aqueous systems. This
situation is reversed in the broader field of chemical
engineering separations in predominantly aqueous systems,
where interest in the fundamentals of interphase mass
transfer remains high,.

Fundamental mass transfer experiments in pyrochemical
systems are conducted in devices which offer the best
possibility of elucidating each of the stages of the over-
all transfer process. High transfer rates are not the
objective, as they are in the development of an efficient
contactor for a practical separation. Instead, mass trans-
fer studies seek to understand the various steps in the
overall process, which include transport in the fluid
phases and transfer across the phase boundary. The ulti-
mate goal of these studies is to provide a sound basis
for predicting transfer rates and the slow step in the
interphase transfer process in complex equipment such as
mixer-settlers, packed columns or spray towers, which have
been considered as potential contactors for pyrochemical
reprocessing flow sheets,

Since the types of contactors contemplated for use in
high temperature fluid-fluid reprocessing schemes are quite
similar to the devices which have been utilized for decades
in the chemical separations industry, an important ques-
tion arises: To what extent can the substantial theoret-
ical information and empirical correlations developed for
low temperature aqueous-organic separations technology
be applied to high-temperature reprocessing?

There are reasons for suspecting that such information

468
is immediately applicable. Mocst mass transfer correla-
tions developed for common contactors are couched in terms
of dimensionless groups, such as a relation between the
Sherwocod number (kd/D, where k = mass transfer coeffi~
cient, d = characteristic length, D = diffusion coeffi-
cient), the Reynolds number and the Schmidt number. Pro-
vided only that the fluids involved in the high tempera-
ture process are Newtonian (which they are) and nc unex-
pected interfaclal reaction occurs, the same correlations
should apply equally well at low or high temperatures, to
fused salts and liquid metals as well as to water and or-
ganic solvents.

There are, however, valid reasons for questicning the
applicability of information obtained from low temperature
aqueous-organic systems to high temperature inorganic sys-
tems. Applying correlations developed for the former to
the latter systems coften requires extending the correlation
far beycend the range for which it was empirically deter-
mined. 7For example, the density differences and inter-
facial tensions between immiscible liquid metals may be
as much as an order of magnitude greater than any aqueous-
organic system. Such a direct extension of heat transfer
correlations of ordinary fluids in pipes to liquid metal
heat transfer, for example, is invalid because of the very
low Prandtl numbers of liquid metals.

Furthermore, although interfacial resistance is rarely
important in clean aqueous-organic solvent extractiocn, the
radically different chemical nature of the phases in liq-
uid metal-fused salt systems may be more conducive to in-
terfaclal resistance, just as many studies of liquid metal
heat transfer have shown evidence of an anamalous resist-
ance at the liquid-solid boundary.

Consequently, ocur object here 1s to review some of the
experimental studies of interphase mass transfer in high
temperature inorganic systems, in order to determine wheth-
er such systems present unique problems, or whether they
can be considered simply as extensions of aqueous-organic
systems. We will consider transfer between two immiscible
liquid phases exclusively, emphasizing extraction between
two liquid metals and liquid metal-fused salt extraction.
The kinetics of gas~solilid reactions, which are important
in fluidized bed reprocessing or gas-fused salt systems
important in some volatility processes, will nct be treat-
ed.

Mass transfer between solid metals and liquid metals
appears to follow the same Batterns as ordinary fluid-
solid systems. Dunn et al{2) have studied natural con-
vective mass transfer of tin, cadmium, zinc and lead cyl-

469
inders into mercury and forced convection mass transfer

of zinec from the walls of zinc tubes into flowing mercury.
Kassner(3) has shown that the dissolution rate of a ro-
tating disk of tantalum into liquid tin is fluid diffusion
controlled and that the rate can be predicted frowm the
solutions of the flow and diffusion equations for this
geometry.

Interphase Mass Transfer Between High Temperature
Immiscible Liquids

Theory

In the absence of a resistance at the phase boundary,
mass transfer between immiscible liquid phases is gov-
erned by the transfer coefficients in each phase and the
thermodynamic equilibrium conditions at the interface.

In keeping with the objectives of fundamental studies of
the mass transfer process, it is important that the con-
tacting methods permit theoretical or empirical estima-
ticn of the diffusional resistances in each phase for
comparison with experiment. It must be possible to es-
tablish the expected diffusion contrelled rate, since any
deviation of the experimental results may be an indication
of an interfacial resistance.

Studies of this type in aqueocous—-organic systems can be
conducted with relatively complex equipment, in order to
allow precise calculation of the individual film resist-
ances., Such devices include laminar jets of one liquid
in another, co-current stratified flow of the two liquids
in a duct, or wetted wall columns in which the central
fluid is liquid. With fused salts and liquid metals at
temperatures in excess of 500°C, however, the experimental
problems involved in using sophisticated contacting de-
vices are insurmountable., Consequently, all studies of
liquid-1iquid extraction kinetics in high temperature
inorganic systems have utilized the classic method of
falling drops.

There is an extensive literature on the theory and
measurement of the mass transfer coefficients outside of
falling drops (the external coefficient) and on the in-
side of the drop (the internal coefficient) to which the
high temperature experimental results can be compared.

Sideman and Shabtai{%4) summarize thirty different cor-
relations that have been employed for the analysis of
external mass transfer in drop extraction. These corre-
lations can be divided into those based upon assumption
of a rigid drop and those based upon internal circulation
within the drop.

The rigid drep models are extensions of the theory of
transfer from a solid sphere, and lead to Sherwood number
relations of the form:

sh = 2 + bsc +/3VRe (1)
e e e
She = ked Sherwood number (2)
D
e
Se = v [D Schmidt number (3)
e e’ Te
Ree = du/\)e Reynolds number (4)

ke is the external mass transfer coefficient (cm/sec),
d thé drop diameter, D, the diffusion coefficient of the
transferring solute in the external (continuous) phase,
Ve the kinematic viscosity of the continuous phase and u
the fall (or rise) wvelocity of the drop.

The constant term "2" on the right of Eq(l) represents
the steady state rate of molecular diffusion in an infin-
ite stagnant liquid surrounding the drop. The second term
in Eq(l) accounts for the increased transfer rate due to
the boundary layer (or "film") generated by the motion of
the drop past the surrounding liquid. Although the coef-
ficient b has been found to vary from 0.4 to 0.9, values
in the vicinity of 0.6 are most common.

Circulation within the drop increases transfer rates
by reducing the external boundary layer. 1In the limit
of no external boundary layer, the velocity field exter-
nal to the drop can be approximated by potential flow and
the resulting Sherwood number is given by:

D ull/2

Sh =‘5: SceRee = Z(Hd

Eq(5) 1is identical to Higbie's penetration theory(s) (un-
steady state diffusion into the fluid adjacent to the
drop) 1f the contact time is considered as the time re-
quired for the drop to fall one diameter,

Models of internal transfer which have been employed
in aqueous-corganic drop extraction studies are based on
stagnant diffus%?n(6 , intermnal circulation(7), a type of
eddy diffusiiB( , and explicit recognition of drop os-
cillation(®> ). Of these, the Handlos=-Baron eddy dif-
fusion model has been used most extensively. The orig-
inal theoretical treatment of this model yielded:

The subscript 1 denotes properties of the drop and U is
the absoclute viscosity. Several modifications of Eq(6),
required to rectify some mathematical deficiencies of the
model, have been develcoped by 0lander(11) and Patel and
Wwellek (120,

The stagnant drop medel of internmal mass transfer ut-
ilizes the solution of the molecular diffusion equation
in a sphere. Transient solutions of this type do not
yield an internal mass transfer coefficient directly. In-
stead, the fraction of the solute initially present in
the drop which has been removed is specified as a functicen
of contact time, The fraction extracted is related to the
internal mass transfer coefficient by:

_ d
k; = - g7 4n(1-£) (19)
where f is the fraction extracted and t is the contact
time, For the solution of the stagnant diffusion model
by Newman , the fraction extracted is:
(o]
f =1 - é? % 15 exp [-nzﬁzT] {11)
i n

where T 1s a dimensionless contact time, defined by:
4Dit
T = —5— (12)
d

Eq(ll) is inconvenient to use when the contact time is
short because many terms of the sum are needed. The alter-
nate expression:

£ = & T o3 (13)
Ll
is satisfactory for nearly all applications of this model

to extraction data. Because of the explicit dependence
of the mass transfer coefficient on contact time in the

472
stagnant drop model, the concept of a mass transfer coef-
ficient loses some of its convenlence.

For extraction systems in which external and internal
resistances are important, the transfer rate is controlled
by the overall mass transfer coefficient:

(14)

where m is the equilibrium ratio of the solute concentra-
tion on the external phase side of the interface to the
concentration on the drop side of the interface. This
relation is useful only if the quantity m is independent
of concentration.

Interfacial Equilibrium

If there are no extraneous resistances at the phase
boundary, the concentrations of the transferring solute
on the two sides are fixed by thermodynamic consideratiomns.
Three types of interfacial equilibria have been investi-
gated in high temperature extraction systems.

1) Physical Equilibrium. When the two phases are immis=-
cible liquid metals, the ccefficient m in Eq(l4) is the
equilibrium distribution ccefficient of the transferring
solute between the two solvent metals. If the diffusing
species 1s solvent 1 transferring to an immiscible liquid
2 which is unsaturated with respect to liquid 1, the coef-
ficient m is the solubility of 1 in 2.

2) Chemical Equilibrium. In fused salt-liquid metal
transfer, the metal phase generally contains a solute
metal which can be oxidized by an extracting agent B+n
in the salt phase. Equilibrium at the interface is gov-
erned by the law of mass action applied to the exchange
reaction:

+n +n
for which
BiSIn
Req = T 40 (16)
ivi

For simplicity, the valences of the two cations S and B

have been taken to be equal. The concentrations in Eq(16)
have been written in terms of molar concentrations, since
these are the appropriate units for describing the diffu-

473
sional transfer step. The subscript i denotes a value

at the phase boundary. The activity coefficient ratios
which normally appear on the right hand side of Eq(l6)
have been assumed constant and incorporated into the equi-
librium constant.

The simple overall mass transfer coefficient concept
of Eq(l4) is inconvenient to use in the present case,
since Eq(16) renders the interfacial equilibrium condition
non-linear. Instead, it is easier to relate the parameters
of the problem (initial concentration, equilibrium con-
stant and mass transfer coefficients) directly to the frac-
tion of the solute extracted from the drop phase. Gen-
erally, the metal phase is dispersed in the continuous
salt phase. A metal drop falling through the salt will
at all times be exposed to the same concentration of ex-
tractant in the salt, or Bt = constant. The concentra-
tion of the solute in the drop decreases from an initial
value of S, to some value S while the product metal in
the bulk of the drop increases from zero to B. Since this
particular exchange reaction is equimolar, S, = S+B. Typ~-
ical concentration profiles near the interface are depicted
schematically in Fig. 1.

The individual film mass transfer coefficients are de-
fined in terms of the molar fluxes per unit interfacial
area and the mclar concentration driving forces:

_ B, +n _+n, _ . B _

Ny = ke(B By ) = k;(B;-B) (17)
Z 1 Ogtn _ S .

N, = kesi = k; (s si) (18)

For the reaction stoichiometry considered in this ex-
ample, Ny = Ng = N. The mass transfer coefficients of the
two species in a given phase differ only if the diffusion
coefficients differ, Since the mass transfer coefficients
vary approximately as the square root or the 2/3 power of
the diffusion coefficient, and since the diffusivities of
similar species in the same solvent are nearly equal, it
is appropriate to make the approximations:

B S B S

ke = ke = ke and ki = ki = ki .

Eqs(16), (17), and (18) must be solved simultaneously to
eliminate all interfacial concentrations and to obtain an
expression for the flux N in terms of the bulk concentra-
tions 8, 8,, and B N the mass transfer coefficients ke
and ki, and the equilibrium constant Keq' In general,

the flux depends upon the concentration 8 in a non-linear
manner,

A significant simplification in the analysis with ex-
change occurs if the equilibrium constant of Eq(16) is
very large (this situation is usually called an "irre-
versible" reaction in the literature on mass transfer with
chemical reaction), If Kegq * ©, either S; or BI® must
be zero. If S; » 0, Eq(l8) indicates that the flux is
given by N = k;8, which is the condition of transfer com-
pletely controlled by resistance within the drop. On the
other hand, if Bin + 0, transfer is controlled completely
by diffusion in the salt phase, and by Eq(l7), N = k B*n,
The actual controlling mechanism is the one which yields
the smaller rate. In a drop extraction experiment, where
the concentration in the metal drop S decreases with con-
tact time, the rate may be controlled by external trans-—
fer in the top of the column and by internmal transfer at
the end of fall., The two mechanisms participate in the
determination of the amount extracted in a consecutive
fashion instead of by the series manner implied in the
overall coefficient of Eq(l4).

If Ko, is finite, Eqs(16) - (18) can be solved for S;n
which is "determined by solution of:

where vy is the ratio ke/ki.
The decrease in the concentration of the solute in the

metal phase as the drop falls through the salt is given
by the material balance:

a contact imé t is determined from:

where SI“ is the solution of Eq{(l9)., 1In general, the in-

tegral on the left of Eq(2l) cannot be performed analyt-

476
ically. The quantity usually measured in the experiment
is the fraction of the solute extracted from the drop aft-
er falling through a length L of salt:

f =1 - S/So (22)
where the contact time is t = L/u.

If the internal resistance to mass transfer is neg~-
ligible (y = 0), Eq(l9) can be solved. The fraction ex~-
tracted 1s given by:
6t

dKeqke( S

- &n(1-£f) + (Keq—l)f = ) (23)

3) Isotopic Equilibrium. If the species 8 and B in the
salt-metal exchange reaction are isctopes of the same met-
al species, the equilibrium constant of Eq(l6) is identi-
cally unity. Eq(1l9) can be solved and the flux written
as:

+n
k (B /S )
N = = — o S (24)
1+(B /SO)Y

The bracketed term in this expression is an overall
mass transfer coefficient of the type given by Eq(l4).
The "distribution coefficient" m is identified with the
concentration ratio (B+n/SO). Isotope exchange has the
capability of covering the entire range from complete in-
ternal control to complete external control simply by ad-
justing the ratio (BYR/s ).

Slow Interfacial Chemical Reaction

If the chemical exchange reaction, Eq(l5), proceeds at
a rate comparable to the diffusion rates, equilibrium be~
tween the two phases at the interface cannot be attained.
If the chemical reaction mechanism is the same as the
overall reaction, the interface condition of Eq(l6) is re-
placed by:

+n
N = kr(BiSi - ESiBi ) (25)

Eq(l6) 1is seen to be a special case of Eq(25) which is
approached as the chemical rate constant kr becomes very
large.

477
Drop Fall Velocity

In order to determine the contact time in a drop ex-
traction process, the fall velocity cof the drop must be
known. These velocities have rarely been measured in high
temperature systems, and the fall veloecity is usuallg com-
puted by assuming that the Hu-Kintner correlation (14 ,
which was developed for aqueous-organic systems, applies,

Comparison With Experiment

Drop extraction experiments provide information on the
variation of the fraction extracted f for variations of
the controllable parameters d (drop diameter}, t (contact
time, varied by adjusting the height of the salt column)
and in chemical or isotopic exchange experiments, by ail-
tering the concentration ratio (B+n/SO). Generally the
temperature is maintained constant at some convenient
value. The experimental results are compared toc a theo-
retical model such as one of those discussed above. Lack
of agreement between theory and experiment can be attri-
buted to one of the fellowing reasons:

1) The theoretical or empirical expressions for ki or
ko (usually taken from investigations of aqueous-organic
systems) do not apply to the high temperature system.

2) A slow chemical step occurs at the interface (i.e.,
k., of Eq(25) is not very large.

3) There is an additional resistance at the interface,
due perhaps to impurities (lack of intimate phase contact
due te non-wetting is very unusual in liquid-liquid sys-
tems).

4) Even if equilibrium prevails at the interface, the
dynamic data (Keq or m) upon which the interface condi-~
tion is based are in error.

5) The transport properties may not have been meas-
ured or are poorly estimated from correlations.

A review of several experiments on high temperature
liquid-liquid extraction will indicate the degree with

which such experiments agree with drop extraction theory.

Drop Extraction Experiments

The first experiments specifically designed to inves-
tigate the kinetics of drop extraction with high tempera-
ture reprocessing in view were those reported by Bonilla
at the First Geneva Conference(1l53),

To minimize the problems associated with containing
reactive metals at elevated temperatures, the lead-zinc

478
system was studied at 450°C. The two partially miscible
solvents were initially free of the other component. The
sealed pyrex tube containing the two sclvents was brought
to temperature in the position shown by the solid diagram
in Fig. 2. The tube was then tilted by 105° so that the
lead fell through the zinc and the zinc rose to the top.
After rapid solidification, the concentrations of zinc in
the lead and lead in the zinc were measured. It was hoped
that the zinc would rise through the lead as a single large
drop, thus permitting comparison of the extermal mass
transfer coefficient in the lead phase and the intermnal
coefficient in the zinc drop with drop extraction theory.
However, the measured external coefficient was 30 times
greater than the value computed from Eq(5), probably be-
cause the zinc phase had broken up intc many small drops
instead of rising as a single sphere,.

Internal coefficients in a fused salt-liquid metal
extraction were measured by Bonilla in the drop rise ex-
periment shown in Fig. 3. The LiGCl-KC1l eutectic contained
in compartment A of the pyrex apparatus was fed by inert
gas pressure through tube E into the cadmium resevoir B.
By forcing the salt through nozzle C, drops of 3 mm diam-
eter were produced. Since cadmium is slightly soluble
in the salt, but the salt is insoluble in cadmiuwm, only
cadmium transfer into the salt drops occurred. The mass
transfer coefficient inside the salt drops was obtained
from the terminal cadmium concentrations in the collected
salt. However, the data were compared to the predictions
of the Higbie model (which applies to external mass trans-
fer) rather than to one of the internal mass transfer
models.

The first salt-metal kinetic experiment which consid-
ered an exchange reaction at the interface was reported
by Katz, Hill, and Speirs in 1960(16) They studied the
transfer of Sm from a bismuth phase to a NaCl-KC1l-MgCl,
salt phase by the Sm-MgCl, exchange reaction. Metal drops
of 2.2 mm diameter were introduced into the salt phase in
the Vycor device shown in Fig. 4, Smooth drop entry was
accomplished by moving the notch in the central rod up to
the bismuth reservoir in the upper compartment, then low-
ering the rod into the salt phase so that the small amount
cf metal contained in the notch fell through the salt. In
order to minimize the continued extraction from the puddle
of metal at the bottom of the coclumn, the constriction
shown in the bottom of the apparatus was provided to re-
duce diffusion to and from the collected metal. The frac-
tion extracted was determined by analysis of the salt aft-
er 15 drops had been released in this fashion. The con-

tact time was varied by using salt columns varying from

7 to 25 cm in height. Because the equilibrium constant
strongly favored accumulation of samarium in the salt
phase (equivalent to a large value of m in Eq(l4)), ex-
ternal resistance to mass transfer was small compared to
resistance within the falling drop. The extraction rates
were satisfactorily represented by the Handlos-Baron in-
ternal mass transfer coefficients (Eq(6)).

Both chemical and isotopic exchange in a fused salt-
liquid metal system were investigated by Olander(17),
Chemical exchange involved extraction of zinc from a zinc-
lead alloy by reaction with lead chloride in the LiC1-KCl
eutectic:

Zn(m) + Pb¥2(s) = Pb(m) + zn'?

(s} (26)

The apparatus used is shown in Fig. 5. Metal drops of
diameters ranging from 1 to 5 mm were introduced into the
top of the column. As in the experiments of Katz et al(lﬁ),
precautions were taken to minimize extraction during drop
entry and after drop fall had been completed. Elimination
of these end effects is essential if the extraction data
are to be compared to the theoretical models described
previously, all of which are based upon mass transfer
only during free fall of the drop.

Mass transfer during introduction of the drop into the
salt was minimized (but not eliminated) by using one of
the two entry techniques shown in Fig. 6. In the rod
entry method, the drop was speared on the tip of a pyrex
rod and lowered into a laver of solute-free salt which
had been carefully poured on top of the extracting salt
in the column, In the dropper entry method, drop fall
was initiated by removing the plunger from the funnel stem
shown in Fig. 6b. The molten metal pellet then fell first
through a solute free layer and then into the extracting
salt,

Reduction of the bottom end effect was accomplished in
the following manner. Just prior to drop release, the
temperature at the bottom of the salt column was reduced
below the freezing point of the salt. The falling drop
encountered an advancing solidification front as it reached
the end of its fall, and continued extraction was pre-
vented by enveloping the drop in solid salt.

Isotope exchange was studied by replacing lead chlor-
ide in the salt phase by zinc chleride. The tracer zinc-
65 in the metal phase exchanged with natural zinc in the
salt phase.

The fractions extracted were the same for both chem-
ical and isotoplc exchange, and both varied linearly with
the ratio of the concentration of extractant in the salt
to the concentration of zinc in the metal. These two ob-
servations suggested complete control of the extraction
process by external (salt phase) mass transfer. The ex-
ternal mass transfer coefficients obtained from the data
were in rough accord with those predicted by the rigid
drop model (Eq(l)).

There were iidications that the mechanism of the inter-
facial reaction 'id not follow the overall reaction of
Eq(26) for all ccnditions. When pure zinc drops were con-
tacted with lead chloride solutions, the recovered drop
was partially encased by a black crust, which consisted
primarily of tiny spheres of metal. It was hypothesized
that the primary rapid reaction at the interface was:

pb¥%(s) + 2zn(m) = Pb(m) + Zn;z(s) (27)

The zinc subchloride begins diffusing towards the bulk of
the salt but produces finely dispersed metal particles in
the boundary layer by one of the following reactions:

anz(s) = Zny + znT%(s) (28)

cr

Zn;Z(s) + pbt2(s) = Pbe + 22nY%(s) (29)

This model predicts that when interfacial reaction is
governed by Eq(27) rather than by Eq(26), twice as much
zinc should be extracted for the same lead chloride bulk
concentration (since each Pb*® reaching the metal drop
moves two zinc atoms by reaction (27) but only one by re-
action (26)). This feature of the subchloride model was
qualitatively confirmed by the extraction data.

The results for this system suggested that a number of
forms of rate-enhancing interfacial turbulence, which have
also been observed in aqueous-organic systems, may be im=-
portant in high temperature inorganic systems as well,
Drop oscillation was observed, and some experiments sug-
gested accelerated transfer due to a Marangoni-type inter-
facial motion.

Mass transfer and drop fall velocities were measured
in an immiscible l%gg}d metal extraction system by Pas=-
ternak and Olander . Lanthanum-140 and barium 140 were
transferred from 2-4 mm diameter drops o¢f the uranium-

485
chromium eutectic alloy freely falling through a column

of molten magnesium at 1000°C. The all-graphite extrac-
tion column shown in Fig. 7 was employed. At this temp-
erature (which is 500°C higher than the three salt-metal
experiments discussed above), not even the modest refine-
ments in drop entry methods used in the salt-metal studies
were feasible, The reactor-irradiated U-Cr drop was simply
suspended from a tungsten wire and lowered into the molten
magnesium. After melting, 1t detached from the wire and
fell through the column, The progress of the drop down
the column was followed by the response cof three colli-
mated scintillation detectors placed at intervals along
the length of the column., To minimize continued extrac-
tion before the system was frozen after an experiment,

a puddle of molten BaCl, was placed at the bottom of the
column to receive the falling drop and remove 1t from dir-
ect contact with the magnesium extractant.

The drop terminal velocities measured from the responses
of the three detectors were in good agreement (15%) with
the Hu~Kintner relation(l , despite density differences,
interfacial tension, and viscosities far beyond the range
of this aqueous-organic based correlation.

Mass transfer coefficients of lanthanum were measured
directly by determination of La-140 activity pick-up in
the magnesium ingot. By following the decay of the La-140
activity in the ingot for about three weeks after the ex~-
periment and utilizing the radiochemical decay properties
of the two member Ba-140-La-140 chain, the mass transfer
coefficient of barium was determined as well.

Since the distribution coefficient (Mg-to-U-Cr) of
lanthanum was approximately 50 times that of barium, lanth=-
anum extraction was expected to be controlled by transport
within the drop and barium extraction by transfer in the
external magnesium phase. These predicitions were borne
out by the data. To within the precision of the data,
lanthanum extraction followed the stagnant diffusion model
of internal transfer (Eq(13)), while barium transfer agreed
with the Higbie model.

Conclusions

Because of the rather forbidding array of problems as-
sociated with working with reactive liquid metals at ele-
vated temperatures, very few high temperature (>5300°C)
liquid-liquid extraction experiments have been performed.
Equilibrium measurements with the same systems of course
encounter identical stringent restrictions on container
materials and system cleanliness, but the kinetic experi-

ments have the additional requirement of moving one phase
relative to the other in a manner which permits theoreti-
cal determination of the flow patterns and hence the mass
transfer coefficients. In addition, the kinetic experi-
ments require reliable equilibrium data (in the form of
distribution coefficients, solubilities, or two-phase equi-
librium constants) in order to interpret the extraction
data. Often, the lack of good thermodynamic or transport
property data may be the greatest impediment to obtaining
reliable mass transfer information. Where such data are
available, the mass transfer studies have shown that the
liquid metal-fused salt extraction kinetics are adequately
described by one of the many mass transfer correlations
developed for low temperature aqueous-organic systems.

The extension of these empirical correlations for physical
properties and temperatures far beyond the range 1in which
they were developed appears justified.

Although aqueous-organic correlations appear to ade-
quately describe the results of the relatively crude high
temperature kinetic measurements, there is no agreement
as to which correlation 1is applicable for a particular
set of conditions. For example, the metal phase internal
coefficlients determined by Katz et al(l6) fit the Handlos-
Baron model, while Pasternak and 0lander(18) found that
the metal phase transfer coefficients agreed best with
the stagnant diffusion model. The applicability of these
two models (which differ quantitatively by a factor of
five under these conditions) may depend upon the nature
of the external phase; in the former, the continuous phase
was a fused salt while in the latter, i1t was another liq-
uld metal. As another example, the salt-metal experiments
of reference 17 showed external transfer coefficients com-
parable to those expected for a rigid drop, yet the ex-
ternal coefficients determined by the metal-metal experi-
ments of reference 18 were of the order expected from the
Higbie model. These two models predict external coeffi-
cient an order of magnitude apart.

Retardation of mass transfer due to interfacial resist-
ance has not been observed in any experiments., If slow
chemical reaction is the form of interface resistance,
this observation 1is not surprising. Chemical rate con-
stants increase much more rapidly with temperature than
mass transfer coefficients, and one would have to search
diligently for a reaction between two fluid phases which
was slower than diffusion in the temperature range from
500-1000°C.

It is somewhat surprising, however, that inhibition of

488
extraction due to interface-seeking impurities have not
been reported, particularly since these effects have

been reported in aqueous—-organic systems. Since most liq-
quid metals at these temperatures will react readily with
impurities in the cover gas, in the solvent phases proper,
or with the container material, there should have been a
much more severe contamination problem than in relatively
non-reactive low temperature aqueous-organic systems.

The mass transfer studies of high temperature liquid-
liquid systems have not yet demonstrated unequivocally
that prediction methods based upon experience with aqueous-
organic systems are directly applicable to pyrochemical
reprocessing systems, They have shown, however, that for
devices such as spray columns and mixer settlers, the lig-
uid metal-fused salt and immiscible liquid metal results
at least fall in the range of the common aqueocus-organic
correlations. So far, no rate-limiting phenomena pecul-
iar to high temperature inorganic species have been un-
covered, However, problems unique to liquid metals may
appear in other contacting devices such as packed col-
umns where phase contact involves a third solid phase.

In this case, the degree of wetting of the packing by
one or both of the immiscible liquid phases may be im-
portant,

I1, Transport Properties of Liquid Metals

Interpretation of mass transfer experiments in liquid
metal-fused salt systems requires a knowledge of solvent
viscosities and solute diffusivities. The dimensionless
Sherwood, Schmidt, and Reynolds numbers, which are used
to correlate mass transfer coefficients, depend upon these
transport properties. In order to apply the correlatiocmns,
measurements or estimates of viscosity and diffusivity for
the particular system of interest are required.

In recent years, considerable effort has been devoted
to measuring the viscosity of pure liquid metals and lig-
uid metal alloys and also to the measurement of diffusion
coefficients in liquid metal systems. Many of these ex-
periments have been on systems of particular importance
in nuclear reactor and pyrochemical fuel processing tech-
nology.

In addition to experimental measurements, methods for
estimating viscosities and diffusivities have been develo~
oped., These methods involve semi-empirical correlations
in which the value of an adjustible parameter is deter-
mined by the existing data. Assuming that liquid metals
al)l show similar behavior with respect to the adjustible
parameter, the correlation can then be applied to systems
for which data are not yet available.

Viscosity Correlations

Two methods for estimating liqui%ZB?tal viscosities
are those of Grosse and Chapman . Grosse's method
assumes an exponential dependence of viscosity on tempera-
ture:

n = a exp [Hn/RT] (30)
where 1 is the viscesity in poises, H, 1s the activation

energy of viscous flow in cal/g-atom, R i1s the gas constant
in cal/g-atom-°K, and T is the absolute temperature in

°K. Andrade's expression(21,22) is used to estimate
viscosity at the melting point.
n_ = 5.7 x 107" —(AT“])UZ (31)
m : y2/3

where A is the atomic weight, I, the melting point, and V
is the atomic volume at the melting point in cc/g-atom.
Grosse finds the following empirical correlation between

490
Hn and the melting point, Tm.

log,gH, = 1.348log) T -0.366 (32)

From Eqs(31) and (32), the pre-exponential factor, a, in
(30) can be determined. Eq(30) can then be used to esti-
mate viscosity over the entire liquid range.

Chapman(zo) uses the radial distribution function con-
cept of the liquid state to establish a functional rela-
tionship between reduced viscosity, reduced veclume, and
reduced temperature. These quantities are reduced with
a distance parameter (the Goldschmidt atomic diameter)
and an energy parameter. Energy parameters for the liq-
uid metals are empirically found to be about 5.2kT.
Grosse's correlation requires the molecular weight, melt-
ing point, and density at the melting point; Chapman's
correlation requires the molecular weight, melting point,
density over the temperature range of interest, and Gold-
schmidt atomic diameter.

Viscosities of the Actinides

The only experimental determination of the viscosity
of plutonium is that of Jones, Ofte, Rohr and Wittenberg(23)
whose measurements cover the range from 645~950°C. O0fte(24)
has also measured the viscosity of uranium contained in
sub-stoichiometric zirconia crucibles from 1141-1248°C.
The viscosity cf uranium has also been measured recently
by Finucane and 0lander(23) in both tantalum and beryllia
crucibles. Their measurements cover the range from the
melting point to 1532°C. All of these measurements employ
the oscillating crucible technique, which is an absolute
mnethod requiring no calibration with a liquid of known
viscosity. The data for these three measurements are
shown in Figure 8 along with values predicted by the Grosse
and Chapman correlations, All of the measured viscosities
are higher than the predicted values, and it may be that
the actinide metals behave as a class apart from other met-
als.

The data of Finucane and Olander for uranium show greater
precision over a wider temperature range than do those of
Ofte, However, the ~ 357 discrepancy between the two sets
of data will have to be resolved by a third measurement.

from the melting point to over 1000°C. Figure 9 compares
the data with Grosse's and Chapman's correlations. Both
correlations fall within the scatter of experimental data
for all three metals. It should be noted, however, that
the activation energy from the least squares fit is much
smaller than that predicted by either of the two correla-
tions. Therefore, extrapolation of the data to higher
temperatures may involve considerable error.

Viscosities of Plutonium Alloys

Since the early 1960's, the viscosities of several
plutonium alloys have been measured at the Mound Labora-
tory. These alloy systems are By-Ce-Co(23), Pu-Ce(ZS),
Pu—Fe(zg), Pu-U(30) ang Pu—Ga(3 . These alloys are of
interest as possible reactor liquid fuels. In all cases,
the addition of alloying elements to plutonium produces
a viscosity increase. The effect is most pronounced in
the case of Ga where a 3.3 atom percent addition causes
a 50% rise above the viscosity for pure plutonium. In
the Pu-U system, there is a relative wviscosity maximum,
apparent in all isotherms up to 800°C, at a composition
of 10.8 atomic percent uranium. This is the composition
of the lowest melting alley in the system, 620°C. Vis-
cosity isotherms for the Pu-Fe system show a maximum at
the eutectic composition of 9.5 atomic percent iron. Vis-
cosity isotherms for the Pu-Ce system are the mgst unusual
cf all. Additions of Ce produce a rise in viscosity to
a maximum at 5 atomic percent cerium. Viscosity then de-
creases to a minimum at 14 atomic percent cerium followed
by a slight rise at the eutectic composition, 16.5 atomic
percent c¢erium., There is no theory to adequately explain
or predict the wide variety of viscosity behavior in liq-
uld metal alloys. Some systems show a viscosity minimum
at the eutectic point. For such a frequently studied sys-
tem as the lead-tin pair there %? disagreement in the lit-
erature. Fisher and Phillips(3 observe a viscosity min-
imum at the eutectic point; Kanda and Colburn cbserve
linear viscosity isctherms over the complete composition
range from pure tin to pure lead. Some Russian investi-
gators have applied thermodynamic (heat of mixing) data
to the study of alloy viscosity behavior. Burylev
has shown a relationship between viscosity isotherms for
Cu-Ag alloys (which have a minimum) and thermodynamic data.
Eretnov and Lyubimov(33) have investigated the relation-
ship between viscosity isotherms for several copper alloy
systems which have maxima and heat of mixing data, while
for other systems volume changes on mixing are more
impeortant.

Diffusivity Correlations

Mutual diffusion coefficients in a number of dilute
liquid meta% sglutions have been correlated by Pasternak
and Olander using a modified form of absolgge rate
theory. The theory was developed by 0lander (3 toc cor-
relate mutual diffusion data in dilute organic systems,
and uses viscosity data for both pure solvent and pure
solute to estimate the difference between the free energies
of activation of the viscous and diffusive processes. The
correlation for liquid metals is shown in Figure 10; the
dashed lines represent 25% deviation from the best line.
The dimensicnless group Y and the parameter f are defined
by:

* *
o =[] =

where k is the Boltzmann constant, N is Avogadro's number,
and AFKA and AFEB are the free energies of activation for
viscosity for pure sclvent and pure solute respectively.
Free energies of activation are obtained from viscosity
data by the expression

= E% exp [AF*/RT] (34)

where h is Planck's constant.

For systems where the diffusing solute is a solid at
the temperature of measurement, AFgp is obtalred by a lin-
ear extrapolation of AFBB values obtained in the 1liquid
region according to:

AF% = AH*-TAS* (35)

where AH* and AS* are the enthclpy and entropy of activa-
tion of viscosity obtained for pure sclute metal above its
melting point.

Liquid metal diffusion coefficients have often been
estimated by the Stokes-Einstein equation:

dynamic model of a large solute atom moving through a con-
tinuous fluid with a "no-slip" condition at the solute

atom surface., For liguid metals, the size parameter r in
Eq(37) 1is wusually taken as the ifionic rather than the atomic
radius of the solute atom. Based on a study of viscosities
in liquid metals, Eyring(3%9) concludes that the unit of
flow is probably the metal ion stripped of its valence
electrons,

For self-diffusion, §=0 and Y=1 in Eqs(32) and (33).
Therefore, if the self-diffusion coefficient for the pure
solvent Dpp is known, the mutual diffusion coefficient
for the solute B in solwvent A, Dpp, can be related to
Dap by Eq(33):

_AB exp [0.58] (37)

The ratio of mutual to self-diffusion in a particular
solvent according to the Stokes-Einstein equation is:

- A

Data for a series of solutes in liquid silver(40,41,42)
is presented in Table 1., Here the Stokes-Einstein esti=-
mate using Goldschmidt ionic radii of the diffusing sol-
ute and solvent molecules shows better agreement with the
data than the same estimate using atomic radii.

Diffusivity of Uranium in Liquid Metals

Figures 11 and 12 present diffusivity data for uran-
ium in bismuth, zinc, cadmium and aluminum. Data for all
four systems were obtained by Hesson, Hootman, and Burris {43)
The aluminum data of Mitamura(4%4) are also included. The
modified absolute rate theory of Eqs(32) and (33) shows a
better agreement with the data than the Stokes-Einstein
equation (36), although except for bismuth, both predic-
tion methods are high.

reprocessing schemes. It 1s therefore desirable to have
available data for the diffusivity of rare earth metals
in molten uranium, The only data in the literature are
those of Smith(43) who measured the diffusivity of cerium
in uranium over the temperature range 1170-1480°C. The
experiments were carried out in fairly large tantalum
crucibles (7 mm. diameter). According to the author, con-
vection at the higher temperatures due to the large dia-
meter increased the uncertainty of the results in the
range 1400-1480°C. The value determined at the melting
point of uranium, D=8,8 =x 10=2 cm /sec, seems somewhat
high also. The value calculated by the Stokes-Einstein
equation is 1.5 x 10-3 cm?/sec. The modified absolute
rate method gives 2.5 x 107° cm“/sec.

The modified absolute rate method for calculating dif-
fusivities is convenient to use since it requires only
viscosity data for the pure solvent and pure solute. The
Stokes=Einstein equation involves an uncertainty as to
the correct radius to assign the diffusing solute atom,
although most workers use the ionic radius. In general,
the modified absclute rate method 1s more accurate. When
applied to common binary metal systems, the Fig, 10 exper-
imental data are correlated to within *25%. For uranium
as solute, good agreement 1s obtained only with bismuth.
The 50% discrepancy in zinc, cadmium and aluminum may in-
dicate that the diffusing amount 1s larger than a single
uranium atom, and may be an intermetallic compound of
uranium and the solvent.

Measurement of Liquid Metal Transport Properties

The measurement of the coefficients of viscosity and
diffusivity in liquid metals 1is subject to the same exper-
imental problems as the mass transfer studles discussed
earlier. Because of the high temperatures involved, con-
struction material and equipment complexity are severely
restricted (at least within the hot zone of the furmnace).
The generation of a prescribed flow field in the liquid
metal is all-important in both viscosity and diffusivity
measurements. In the former, the fluilid mechanices of the
device must be known because the relation between the
shear stress and veloclty gradients in the fluld estab-
lishes the coefficlent of viscosity. In diffusion mea-
surements, all fluld velocities should be zero.

Viscositz

The various methods which have been used to measure
liquid metal viscosities have been reviewed by Thresh (46),

501
In the capillary method, the liquid is forced through
a narrow tube by inert gas pressure or by the hydrostatic
head of the moving fluid itself. The use of an inert gas
is often incompatible with the vacuum system required to
insure fluid cleanliness. Surface tension effects may in-
hibit flow in the capillary. A rather large hot zone is
necessary and the mechanical complexity of the open flow
renders this method unsuitable for high melting reactive
metals.

In rotational visccometers, the liquid metal is con-
tained as an annular ring formed by a central cylinder
rotating at a constant speed and a stationary outer cyl-
inder. The viscosity can be determined by the torque on
the outer c¢ylindex. The problems of driving the inner
cylinder and of measuring the tordque on the outer cylinder
are difficult in high temperature vacuum systems. In ad-
dition, accumulation of slag (due to impurities) at the
rather small annular liquid surface between the two cyl-
inders significantly affects the measurements.

Oscillating crucible viscometers have been used almost
exclusively for viscosity measurements above 1000°C. 1In
this method, a specimen of metal is sealed in a cylindri-
cal crucible suspended in the hot zone of a furmace by a
torsion wire. The pendulum is given an initial twist and
the damping of the torsional oscillations is directly re-
lated to the viscosity. The amount of metal used is quite
modest: specimens are v 2 cm diameter by v 7 cm bigh, and
of an easily machinable shape. The simple geometry also
permits fabrication of nearly any high temperature con-
tainer material for the crucible, The crucible (or an
outer refractory metal sheath) can be vacuum sealed by
electron beam welding, thereby permitting complete iso-
lation of the melt from the vacuum environment and attain-
ment of temperatures at which the vapor pressure of the
liquid would otherwise be unacceptably high for the vacuum

system, The only motion required is simple torsional os-
clllation, which can be initiated from ocutside the vacuum
system. No measurements within the vacuum system are re=-

quired; the temperature can be measured with an optical
pyrometer and the period and damping constant ¢f the os-
clllation are determined by the motion of a light beam re-
flected from the part of the pendulum outside of the fur-
nace. The liquid metal surface is relatively large *

2 cm diameter), thereby reducing the effects of surface
tension and slag-wall interactions.

The apparatus depicted in Fg. 13 is currently in use

in our laboratory, but 1is typical c¢f the design of most
high temperature vacuum oscillating crucible viscometers.

The furnace heater element (A) is surrounded by a series
of tungsten radiation shields (B). The entire system is
contained within a vacuum system (C).

The torsion pendulum consists of three primary parts:
the crucible (D) which contains the metal specimen; a rod
(E) which rigidly connects the crucible with the part of
the pendulum outside of the hot zone; and the external
portion of the pendulum (¥} which has a polished surface
to reflect a beam of light by which the motion of the pen-
dulum is monitored. A hole is drilled through the pen-
dulum perpendicular to its axis of rotation into which
rods may be inserted and fixed such that the moment of
inertia of the pendulum may be varied. The small chuck
at (G) attaches the pendulum to the torsion wire. A pic-
ture of the entire pendulum in shown in Fig. 14.

The torsion wire (H) extends from the pendulum to a
second chuck which is attached to a rotatable holder (J)
which rests on a support plate (K}. The holder is attached
mechanically to a rotary feedthrough (L) by which the ro-
tary motion of the pendulum may be initiated from outside
the vacuum system.

The temperature within the furnace region is measured
by an optical pyrometer (M) which is sighted through a
right angle prism (N) into a hole, 1/8 inch in diameter,
drilled through the bottom shield pack into the inner
furnace region.

Dif fusion Coefficients

Most liquid metal diffusivity measurements are per-
formed in "capillary" cells. In room temperature measure-
ments on aqueous or organic solutions, diffusion occurs
along the length of narrow bore tubing, and the concen-
tration profile can be directly measured by cptical methods.
With liquid metals, however, the capilillary 1is more aptly
described as a tube, since diameters up to 7 mm have been
used. The concentration profile cannot be measured in
situ; rather the final profile is determined by freezing
the system and sectioning the capillary for analysis by
chemical or radiochemical means. Application of the com-
mon capilliary Eeghods to liquid metals has been discussed
by Niwa et al( 7,

for low melting metals, a U-tube containing the pure
solvent is lowered into an alloy bath. After a definite
diffusion time, the U-tube is withdrawn from the bath,
quenched and sectioned for analysis., Because of the very
uniform temperature of the alloy bath into which the U-

504
Viscometer pendulum (25).

tube is placed, temperature variations and the resulting
natural convection in the diffusion region are virtually
eliminated. However, the method is inconvenient for high
temperature vacuum environments because of the rather sub-
stantial amount of metal required for the alloy bath and
because of the complications Involved in raising and low-
ering the U-tube into and out of the hot zone,

The bath-less capillary method utilized by Smith(45)
for measurements of diffusion in uranium is suitable for
reactive liquid metals at temperatures above 1000°C.
Smith's apparatus is shown in Fig. 15, In this arrange-
ment, both components are placed in the c¢ylindrical cru-
cible which serves as the diffusion "capillary". Care
must be taken to avoild convective mixing of the two com=-
ponents (which may or may not be immiscible when liquid)
during melting. This method 1is more susceptible to nat-
ural convection mixing due to temperature gradients than
is the bath method. ©Natural convection can be reduced by
using specimens of large length-to-diameter ratios, although
this geometry accentuates the effect of gettering of the
diffusing solute by reaction with the container wall. The
effects of vertical and horizontal temperature gradients
on induced convective motion have been analyzed by Ver-
hoeven and found to be an unlikely source of systen-
atic error (theoretically at least). The mixing which
occurs during melting and freezing of the sample, however,
can undcubtedly contribute to high apparent diffusion coef-
ficlents.

Abstract

Investigations of the chemistry of plutonium, uranium, and
fission products in liquid metal-molten salt systems show that
good recovery of purified plutonium is possible by liquid metal-
molten salt extraction. The application of a semi-continuous
mixer-settler for such extractions is under development. The
flowsheet involves the selective extraction of rare earths from
a Mg-Cu-Pu-fission products alloy into a series of salts at 650°C,
selective extraction of plutonium into another salt away from the
nobler elements and uranium, and re-extraction and concentration
of the purified plutonium in another alloy. The design specifi-
cation 1s recovery of 99.8% of the plutonium with a decontamination
factor of 106,

During a run, some of the fluid phases flow continuously between
stages, and the feed alloy is recirculated through the extractor
several times. Other phases are only moved batchwise between runs.
The resultant flow pattern makes application of conventional designs
unattractive or impossible. The design selected consists of a
modular assembly of mixer and settler chambers. A simple agitator-
pump moves the fluids out of each mixing chamber to a settling
chamber. The separated phases flow to adjacent mixing chambers
through overflow spouts.

Pumping and mixing performance has been investigated for various
designs. A reference design has been selected, and extraction runs
are ready to begin.

Introduction

The Salt Transport Process under development at Argonne
incorporates multistage liquid metal-salt extraction for the
purification of plutonium from fast reactor fuels. This paper is
a report on the status of the development of equipment for the
plutonium purification step. The complete Salt Transport Prgcess
flowsheet is presented in another paper in this symposium.(l

The feed to the extraction step is a liquid alloy of Mg-42 at. %
Cu-2 at. % Pu-1 to 2 at, % fission products. Many of the fission
products and most of the uranium are separated from plutonium during
the decladding and reduction steps that precede the extraction step.
The objective of the extraction step is to remove yttrium and the
rare earth elements for disposal and to recover plutonium selectively
from uranium, nobler fission elements (zirconium, niobium, ruthenium, ‘
molybdenum, technetium, and palladium), and residual cladding
elements (iron, chromium, and nickel). These separations are
accomplished by selective extraction of yttrium and the rare earths
into a molten chloride salt, and subsequent selective extraction of
plutonium into another chloride salt. The purified plutonium is
concentrated by extraction back into an alloy. Neptunium and curium
follow plutonium through the extraction, but the other transuranium
elements are removed with the rare earths.

The metal-salt extractions are the results of the equilibrium
reactions,

The extraction factor, R, is useful in process design. It is

the amount in the metal:

The separation factor, o, for two elements is defined as the ratio
of their distribution coefficients:

(4)

where A and B are two different elements.

The magnitude of the distribution coefficients is dependent
on the equilibrium constant for the reaction (equation 1), the
activity coefficients for the components in the metal and salt
phases, and the magnesium and magnesium chloride content of the
metal and salt phases. The application and control of these
variables in designing chemical segarations is discussed in
another paper in this symposium.{2) The metal and salt phases for
the present separation operations were selected to optimize
Plutonium-rare earth separation and to provide distribution
coefficients that allow workable extraction factors at convenient
salt-to-metal ratios.

The selection of an extraction philosophy for the Salt Transport
Process required consideration of many factors, such as composition
specifications for product and wastes, plutonium inventory,
criticality, waste volumes, materials of conatruction, process
control, process flexibility, and phase transfer efficiency. The
goal of the extraction step is recovery of 99.8%7 of the plutonium
with 8 decontamination factor of 10® for fission product radio-
activity. The waste streams are to be as small as compatible with
decay heat removal,

Batchwise operation was rejected for the multistage extraction
because of the many phase transfers that would be involved and
because of the difficulty in performing the clean phase separations
necessary to utilize the large separation factors available,
Countercurrent columns were considered for the process(3) but are
not being used in the current flowsheet because they are not
compatible with the flow pattern selected. A semi-continuous
procedure employing a battery of mixer~settlers has been adopted.

Extraction Strategy

The first stages of the extraction step are designed to move
rare earths from the feed solution into a waste salt phase without
undue loss of plutonium. This might conventionally be performed
in a series of stages as indicated in Figure 1. The scrubbing
stages remove rare earths from the product, and the stripping
stages prevent excessive plutonium logses. For the present
metal-salt systems, a relatively small scrubbing section of 2 or 3
stages would be required but about B8 more stages would be required
for stripping. The semi-continuous mode of operation which has

been labeled 'metal transport' has proved very attractive. Figure 2
is the flow diagram and illustrates the following operations:

(1) Alloy containing plutonium and fission products is contacted
with salt in a series of stages to perform the scrubbing of rare
earths. The salt is not circulated between stages but is 'captive"
in each stage, (2) Plutonium is extracted from the alloy in a
"donor" stage in which the plutonium extraction factor is increased.
(3) The alloy is recycled through the same captive salts to perform
the stripping of plutonium from the salt until the level of
plutonium in the stage 1 salt is sufficiently low for disposal.

(4) Metal circulation is terminated. (5) The alloy is returned

for reuse in earlier process steps and fresh feed is charged to

the feed tank. (6) The salt in stage 1, containing most of the

rare earths, 1s discarded. (7) The salt phases in stages 2, 3,

and 4 are transferred to stages 1, 2, and 3, respectively, (8) Fresh
salt is added to stage 4. (9) Processing of a new batch begins

with circulation of the feed alloy.

Following the rare earth removal, the plutonium is selectivel
extracted from the nobler elements by a 'salt transport" step.(2¥
Plutonium is extracted into a salt in the donor stage; this salt
is scrubbed in the next stage with a captive alloy for further
nobler metal removal and to minimize introduction of feed solvent
to the product alloy; the salt is then contacted with a captive
"acceptor'" alloy which extracts the plutonium; the salt, which
serves only as a transport medium, is recycled to the donor stage.
At the conclusion of an extraction run, the acceptor alloy con-
taining the purified plutonium is removed and fresh acceptor

alloy is charged. The scrub alloy has capacity for many runs,

but eventually it is discarded and replaced. In normal operation,
nothing accumulates in the transport salt, and it can be used
indefinitely. The level of uranium and nobler metals in the Mg-Cu
alloy, which is reused, is controlled by their removal in the
reduction step and by discarding a small portion of the Mg-Cu
alloy before recycle to the reduction step.

The entire extraction step is 1llustrated schematically in
Figure 3. The seven stages indicated are expected to provide
the desired decontamination factor of 106, but one or two
additional stages can be added if extraction experience indicates
they are necessary. The composition of the process solvents are
summarized in Table I, and some pertinent distribution coefficients
are listed in Table II, The distribution coefficients are relatively
constant over the range of solute concentrations to be encountered.
From these distribution data the excellent separation factor of
1000 obtained between plutonium and cerium with the Mg-Cu solvent
can be seen. The distribution coefficient for plutonium being
unity allows extraction of plutonium in either direction depending
on the salt-to-metal ratio (see equation 3). The scrub alloy has
the desired low distribution coefficient for nobler metals
(zirconium is the most difficult to separate) and a sufficiently

high value for plutonium to minimize plutonium holdup in the

scrub stage. The Zn-Mg acceptor alloy provides the low distribution
coefficient necessary to extract plutonium out of the transport
salt.

The interaction of many parameters are encountered in the
proposed stages. These include metal tc salt ratios, tetal
volume of captive phases, hold-up times, number of metal and
salt eycles, and the number of stages, A computer program was
prepared and is used to calculate expected extraction performance
for different combinations of parameters; however, extraction
rate data are needed to permit optimization of other parameters.

Selection of Contactor Configuration

Mixer-settler designs used in the chemical processing industry
have been reviewed. (4-9) Probably the simplest and most versatile
form is one in which mixing is done 1in one vessel and settling in

517
another. A variety of flow patterns of heavy and light phases

may be employed with this equipment. Mixing and settling regions
are incorporated inside of a single vessel in some designs.
Arrangements have been made in which the stages are stacked
vertically so that only one rotating shaft is used for agitation
in all of the stages. Such an extractor forms a tower in which
the heavy liquid enters at the top and leaves at the bottom, and
the light liquid enters at the bottom and leaves at the top. Density
difference between the two immiscible liquids causes the phases to
separate in each settling region after mixing and causes the light
liquid to flow up the tower. Another arrangment places the stages
side by side., The stages are commonly in the shape of boxes which
may be compartmentalized by baffles. Each mixing stage has its
own agitator shaft. Such units are commonly known as the box-type
mixer-settler,

Some mixer-settler designs were eliminated from consideration
for a pyrochemical process because of the elevated temperature of
operation and limitations in fabrication with suitable materials
of construction. The unconventional flow patterns in the present
process also eliminated some designs. A box-type mixer-settler was
selected as the most appropriate.

In the conventional box-type mixer-settler, two liquids flow
continuously and countercurrently through the stages. In the
present system, multiple fluids are employed. The proposed flow
patterns for a box-type mixer~gsettler are shown in plan view in
Figure 4. In the metal transport stages (a 'stage' consists of
a mixing chamber and a settling chamber) the liquid metal flow
is continuous through all stages, but the salt within each stage is
captive and is recirculated within the stage. The salt in each of
these stages is periodically withdrawn and moved one stage up-
stream (with reference to the direction of metal flow). In the
salt transport stages, the first stage is conventional in the
manner in which salt and metal move in, through, and out. However,
in the remaining stages the salt moves continuously through while
the metal phases are captive and are recirculated within each
stage, Periocdically the metal phases are removed and replaced with
fresh metal.

Because of the special fluid movement requirements, an extractor
concept employing a pump in each stage was chosen rather than one
utilizing the pumping effects of the mixers as other designers
have done.(l”79 The action of liquid in the pumps is similar to
that in a vertical-bowl centrifuge which is charged on its axis
at the bottom and discharges at the top. The pump tube is partially
submerged in the fluid, and fluid enters an inlet in the bottom
located on the axis. Centrifugal force lifts fluid up the wall
of the pump to discharge openings near the top. The head which is
developed is roughly proportional to the square of the internal
radius of the cylinder and to the square of the rotational speed.

Seven-Stage Mixer-Settler - Schematic Plan View
The rotating tube need not be cylindrical; a conical shape would
be desirable but is more difficult to fabricate. The pumps are
suspended by heavy shafts which are supported and sealed above the
heated zone. Mixing blades are mounted on the mixer-pumps to
promote agitation. Similar pumps, but without mixing blades, are
used for the periodic removal of fluids from a settling region.

The discharge openings at the upper end of the tube consist of
slots cut in the tube wall. The liquid collects in a chamber
surrounding the top end of the tube and can be routed as required
in the particular application. The flow out of the collecting
chamber of an agitator-pump is directed into a settling chamber.
The flow from a pump emploved to transfer fluid from the settling
region of one stage to another stage is directed to the settling
region of the latter stage.

Equipment Design and Performance

Design efforts have been concentrated on developing a universal
mixer—-settler stage that is applicable to operation with either
metal or salt phase captive. In selecting a design, plastic mixer-
settler models were built and tested with water and organic fluids.
Acetylene tetrabromide in which xylene was dissolved to alter the
density and water were used as the liquid phases in the early tests.
One agitator-pump configuration was also operated with molten
Mg-Cu alloy in a stainless steel mixing stage. The pumping
characteristics were the same for each of the fluid systems; the
volumetric flow rate was independent of the density of the pumped
liquid. The more recent flow tests were made using water or
water-carbon tetrachloride. Design characteristics sought include
high stage efficiency, simple control of flow rates, variable
interstage flow patterns, and confinement of metal fumes.

Figure 5 is a schematic section of the current stage design.
The plastic model of this design is shown in Figure 6. This
particular configuration was selected to provide a mixing chamber
of about 1 liter volume and a mixer which would produce a high
degree of agitation while reducing bypassing of solutions to an
acceptably low level. The top baffle and sleeve prevent the
entrainment of gas intc the fluids as long as the liquid level
above the baffle is at least 3 centimeters, resulting in more
stable mechanical operation and higher power input at any given
mixer speed.,

In normal operation with a two phase system, both phases enter
the zone above the mixing chamber and flow downward through the
two zones of the mixing chamber. Here the phases are vigorously
agitated and eventually enter the bottom of the pump through the
inlet orifice. The phases then flow through the collecting
chamber and into the settling chamber. The inverted cup surrounding

the pump outlet (not present in Figure 6) eliminates splashing.

In the settling chamber the fluids separate, the light (salt)
phase flows out through an overflow spout, and the heavy (metal)
phase flows under a baffle and through an overflow spout. The
flow is either back to the mixing chamber or to the mixing chamber
of an adjacent stage.

The settling and mixing chambers are separate vessels. This
modular design was selected to increase the flexibility in mixer-
settler arrangement, simplify fabrication, and ease maintenance.
Fluid flows into modules through the spouts located above the
liquid level as shown in Figure 5. The necessary lifting of the
fluids is accomplished by the pumps.

The liquid levels in a settling chamber are fixed by the
vertical position of the outlet spouts (see Figure 5). The volume
of each liquid phase in the settling chamber is also fixed, 1In
all stages but stage 5 in Figure 4, a constant quantity of captive
phase is present. Since the quantity in tramsit in the pump and
collecting ring is small and relatively constant, the amount of
captive phase in the mixer can be controlled by selecting an
appropriate total inventory of that phase in the stage. The flow
capacity of the pump and the net flow rate of the other phase
establish the salt to metal ratio and total holdup in the mixing
chamber, For stage 5, the metal and salt flow rates establish
the salt-to-metal ratio and, with the flow~to-1lift characteristics
of the pump at the operating speed, fix the mixing chamber holdup.

The pumps are designed so that the variation in total liquid
holdup in a mixing stage will keep the liquid surface above the
top horizontal baffle and below the inlet openings. The salt-to-
metal ratios are selected to obtain favorable extraction factors
(equation 3).

In arriving at the present design, many power inpuvt and pumping
rate tests were conducted using water as a single phase. Mixing
power was determined using a dynamometer which measures drive-motor
torque. Pumping rates were measured for different lifts,
inlet orifice sizes, and rotational speeds. Results of three
pumping runs are presented in Figure 7. As shown in the figure,
the pumping rate increases and then levels off as the mixer
speed increases. This condition permits a fairly stable pumping
rate to be maintained without precise control of mixer speed and
yet provides for a reasomable range of pumping rates. During these
tests the water level was maintained about 6 cm above the top
baffle, Variation of the height of water resulted in a moderate
corresponding change in pumping rate. Thus the pump equipped with
a 0.95 cm orifice and operating at 650 rpm delivered 76, 81, and
89 ml/sec when the water level was respectively 4,8, 6.0 and 8 cm
above the baffle., This change in pumping rate corresponding to
changes in liquid head would tend to stabilize the flow in a

The power input to the mixing chamber as related to mixer-pump
speed is shown in Figure 8. This power input is nearly independent
of pumping rate since the pumrping power (less than 0.5 watt) is
small compared to the mixing power.

Since the pumping rate and power input are both dependent upon
agitator-pump speed, it would be desirable to have a mixing chamber
and pump design in which power input increased more rapidly with
mixing speed than did the pumping rate. Under such conditions the
reduced residence time which results from increased throughput
would be offset by increased mixing intensity. Figure 9 shows
the relationship between power input and flow rate at various
mixer speeds for the three different sizes of pump crifice
presented in Figure 7, Over the range of probable operating
speeds (i.e., 600-800 rpm) there is an increase in overall mixing
intensity with increased pumping rate. Thus high stage efficiency
is likely to be maintained as flow rates are increased.

In experiments involving batch extraction of cerium from Cd-Zn-Mg
alloy into MgCl,-NaCl-KCl at 600°C, about 95% equilibrium composition
was reached in about 4 minutes and 100% in about 10 minutes.(ll
Power input to the contactor was 1.3 watts/liter. Power input in the
proposed mixing chamber design (see Figure 8) is 40 watts/liter
when mixing water at 700 rpm. The power input under the same mixing
speed and geometry will be nearly three times as high, or about
100 watts/liter, when mixing higher density molten salt and metal.
This represents a power input which is almost 80 times as great as
that used in the above batch test. Accordingly, it is estimated
that 100% equilibrium conditions would be reached in a few seconds
if the phase contacting were being done under batch mixing conditions.

The multistage mixer-~settler will operate under continuous flow
conditions with a wmean residence time of one minute or less. 1In a
full backmix stage* the residence time of any infinitesimal unit
of material varies from zero to infinity. When very high (n99%)
stage efficlency 1s desired, the mean residence time is far less
significant than is the fraction of material exposed for short
times. In the salt-metal systems of interest, the rates of
extraction are known to be rapid, but have not been precisely
defined. Therefore, the mixing chamber was designed to minimize
the quantity of material leaving the chamber with a short residence
time.

*A full backmix stage is one in which the composition of all the
material in the stage i1s uniform at any instant so that the
material leaving the stage has the same composition as the material
in the stage.

In the present design of the mixing chawrber, a fixed horizontal
baffle with an 8.9 cm dia opening is positioned at about mid-ele-
vation of the chamber. A horizontal disk, 7.6 cm OD, is mounted
on the mixer-pump at the same elevation. Thus the mixing chamber
is divided into two zones with a 0.65 cm annvlar connection. A
model has also been tested in which the annular space is further
restricted by the use of a smaller opening in the fixed baffle.
These configurations are intended to reduce top-to-bottom mixing
and approach the performance of two backmix stages operating
in series.

A series of tests was conducted to determine the residence .
time distribution in the mixing chamber. The tests were conducted

in a non-flow system with the pump inlet orifice closed. The

tests were designed to measure the approach to equilibrium composi-
tion at the bottom of the mixing chamber after a small quantity of ‘
acid was injected just below the top horizontal baffle, A pair of
platinum electrodes adjacent to the injection point signaled the

start of injection and a pair of electrodes at the bottom of the
mixing chamber (close to the normal pump orifice position) sensed

the rise in solution conductivity at that point. A Midwest Model

1210 high speed recording oscillograph was used to record conduc-
tivity changes which could then be converted to molarity changes

in accordance with a predetermined calibration. Figure 10 is a
reproduction of a typical oscillograph chart tracing for cne of

these tests. This test was conducted at a mixer speed of 600 rpm.

As shown in the figure, the injection time is indicated by a

sharp rise in conductivity at the upper electrodes. Following a

delay of about 0.2 sec there is a continuous rise to equilibrium
concentration at the bottom electrodes. On the basis of this

test and similar tests conducted at various mixing speeds, the

rate of approach to uniform composition was determined as shown

for four runs in Figure 11l. From these data it is possible to .
calculate a residence time distribution curve for any net flow

through the mixing chamber.

If a reaction rate curve could be determined for a batch .
extraction run in a mixing chamber, mass transfer coefficients
could be calculated. These coefficients could then be handled
in accordance with existing correlations to predict the performance
of alternative designs. The extraction is much too fast to
determine by conventional sampling techniques; the phases equili-
brate in about 4 seconds. Nevertheless, the shape of the reaction
curve can be assumed, for example:

On this basis it is possible to predict the stage efficiencies

which can be expected under a variety of mixing conditions (residence
time distributions) and for a range of reaction times (see Table III).
It is anticipated that experiments planned with molten salt and

metal will provide sufficient data to permit the calculation of a
reaction rate curve of a form such as indicated in equation 5.

Evaluation of mechanical performance and determination of stage
efficiency will be based upon tests to be conducted in a single
stage unit using molten salt and metal at about 650°C. Components
of the stage have been constructed of type 304 S5.S. The mixing
chamber configuration is identical to the design used in the plastic
model tests; the mixer-pump is the same unit used in the plastic
model tests.

Discussion

When the single-stage metal-salt extractor has been optimized
and demonstrated, a multistage mixer-settler will be constructed.
The multistage unit will be used in the Plutonium Salt Transport
Experiment which will involve the investigation of the entire
Salt Transport Process on a scale of 1 kg of plutonium. It is
expected that the multistage mixer—settler will be fabricated
of niobium and tantalum, but the selection of materials is still
underway.(lz) The stability of the materials with respect to
plutonium is as important as their resistance to corrosion by the
molten salts and metals. For example, 300 and 400 series stainless

531
steels appear to have adequate resistance to chloride salts and
Mg-Cu alloys, but appear to react with dissolved plutonium.

The seven-stage mixer-settler (including external drives and
heaters) will be about 70 c¢m wide by 120 cm long by 150 cm
high. This unit is as small as is practical because of clearances
needed for agitator-pump drives and heaters. In the Plutonium
Salt Transport Experiment, the extraction batch size will be about
40 kg of Mg-Cu-Pu-fission products alloy containing 1 kg of
plutonium, This solutiom, which is intentionally dilute to provide
a reascnable volume of feed solution, will be processed in about
4 hours. The extractor will have capacity for purifying about
30 kg of plutonium per day which is more than the expected average
daily discharge of plutonium from fast reactors generating 5000 mW
of electricity,

The acceptor stage of an extractor will contain the largest
quantity of plutonium, and the criticality limitation for this
stage will determine the maximum batch size,

The allowable quantity of plutonium is greatly increased by
the selection of an acceptor alloy composition for which the solid
plutonium phase in equilibrium with saturated solution is a Pu-Zn
intermetallic compound rather than pure plutonium. It is expected
that the acceptable batch size will be about 20 kilograms of
plutonium. This limit might be increased if the acceptor alloy is
replaced continuously or intermittently during a run.

Abstract

The region of liquid immiscibility in the binary Pu-Mg system
was determined by chemical analyses of the equilibrium liquid
phases. The magnesium content of the plutonium-rich phase ranged
from 0.49 at. % at 650°C to 2.22 at. % at 900°C, while the
plutonium content of the magnesium-rich phase varied from 10.5 at. %
at 523°C to 11.5 at. % at 900°C. The consolute temperature is
estimated to be 1040 + 10°C. Thermal analysis data are given for
several solidus transition temperatures. The thermodynamic
properties of liquid Pu-Mg alloys were estimated from the compo-
sitions of the equilibrium liquid phases assuming the alpha
function {1ln yi/(l-Ni)z] to be a linear function of Nj. The
estimated data are in agreement with previously reported thermo-
dynamic data for dilute solutions of plutonium in liquid magnesium
solutions.

Introduction

In the course of pyrochemical process development studies data
were obtained on tge ﬁglubility of plutonium in liquid ternary
Zn-Mg—-Pu alloys.(l » These solubility data indicated that the
liquid phase immiscibility region of the binary Pu-Mg system
extended well into the ternary system, However, discrepancies
were found between extrapolated data for the compositions of the
two immiscible liquid phases in the binary Pu-Mg system from
plutonium solubility measurements in the ternary system and
the estimated immiscibility gurve for the binary system reported
by Schonfeld and Ellinger.(3 The results of an experimental
determination of the miscibility curve by chemical analyses of the
liquid phases in the Pu-Mg system are reported below. The results
of the determination, by thermal analysis, of the temperatures
for several solidus transformations are also reported. Finally,
the miscibility gap composition-temperature data were used to
estimate the thermodynamic properties of liquid Pu-Mg alloys.

Experimental

The purities of the magnesium and plutonium used in the
investigation were greater than 99.95 and 99.9%, respectively.

The Pu-Mg alloys were contained in a tantalum crucible
(5 cm I.D.,) with a tapered bottom inside a graphite liner. The
crucible assembly was located inside a resistance-heated, stainless
steel furnace tube which was equipped with a sampling port, a
tantalum thermocouple well, a tantalum paddle stirrer, and gas
inlet and cutlet tubes. The furnace tube contained a purified
helium atmosphere (one atmosphere pressure) and was located in a
glovebox filled with purified nitrogen. The temperature was
measured to +0.5°C with calibrated chromel-alumel thermocouples.

An initial charge of 64 g of plutonium and 16 g of magnesium
was added to the tantalum crucible. The furnace tube was then
repeatedly evacuated and flushed with helium. After the furnace
had been heated to the desired temperature, the system was allowed
to equilibrate for two hours at constant temperature and a
stirring rate of 200 rpm. At temperatures above 875°C the helium
pressure in the furnace tube was increased to 2 atm to diminish
the vaporization of magnesium. During the course of the experiment,
more plutonium was added to produce an approximate composition of
Pu-50 at. % Mg. Finally, magnesium was added to determine the
liquidus line in the magnesium~rich region of the system,

The two liquid phases were sampled after the mixture had been

equilibrated and allowed to settle for 15 min. The sampling
device consisted of a tantalum tube 6 mm I.D. and 7 cm long, which

536
was closed at one end by a porous tantalum frit and at the other
end by a threaded plug which could be attached to a stainless
steel rod. The sample tube attached to the stainless steel rod
was inserted into the furnace through a valve and gas seal on the
sampling port. After a 5-min period the sample tube was lowered
into one of the liquid metal phases and a sample was forced into
the tube by pressurizing the system for 30 sec with 1 atm of
additional helium pressure. The sample was then withdrawn and
allowed to solidify quickly in the cool sampling port. The excess
helium pressure was then released, and the sample tube, after it
had cooled, was withdrawn into the nitrogen atmosphere. The

frit and any material adhering to the outside of the sample tube
were removed mechanically to avoid possible cross-contamination of
the sample by the other liquid metal phase,

The plutonium was determined with a precision of #27% by hexone
extraction and alpha counting. The magnesium was determined with
+1% precision by EDTA titration after the plutonium had been
removed by double precipitation.

Several cooling curves were determined by repeated temperature

cycling of the system. The accuracy of transition temperatures
obtained by this technique is estimated to be +3°C,

Results and Discussion

The results are given on a weight and atom percent basis in
Table I and are plotted in Figure 1. The plutonium-rich phase
contained very little magnesium (0.49 at. % at 650°C and 2.22 at. 7%
at 900°C). The composition of of the magnesium-rich phase was
almost independent of temperature between the monotectic point
at 523°C and 900°C, where the plutonium concentrations were
10.5 and 11.5 at. %, respectively. The miscibility gap closes
rapidly above 900°C, with an estimated consolute temperature of
1040 + 10°C. Because of the very low magnesium concentration in
the plutonium-rich phase, no attempt was made to determine the
monotectic point in this region. Such a determination would re-
quire accurate analyses of magnesium at concentrations of less
than 0. 01 wt %.

The thermal halts observed in several cooling curves indicate
transition temperatures of 523 + 3°C for € + 6 « e + L, and
638 + 3°C for ¢ + L, e Ly + L,. These transition temperatures
differ somewhat from the tentative values given by Schonfeld and
Ellinger.(l The boundaries of the 6 + L, field are only
moderately well-defined. The solid solubility of plutonium in
8-magnesium is approximately 2 at. % at 550°C, The solid solubility
of magnesium in e-plutonium has not been determined, but the
indications are that any solid solution in this region would con-
tain less than 0.5 at. % magnesium.

Thermodynamic Properties of Liquid Plutonium-Magnesium Alloys

The thermodynamic properties of liquid Pu-Mg alloys were
estimated from the compositions of the equilibrium liquid phases
using the method repogrted by Wriedt. 4) 1n this method the
"sub-regular" model, ¢®) in which the alpha function is assumed
to be a linear function of composition is used, i.e., if

In v
0 = @
(1-N)

where y; is the activity coefficient of the ith component at an
atom fraction of Ny, then

@, = A+ B (1 - Ni) (2)

where A and B are temperature dependent empirical coefficients.
From the necessary condition that the activities of each component
be equal in the two equilibrium liquid phases, two independent
relations involving A, B, and the compositions of the two liquid
phases may be derived which may be used to compute values of A and
B. The details are given by Wriedt. (%) This simple two-parameter
equation was used in prefer?nge to the four-parameter Lumsden
equation(6) which Sundquist 7 reported to give a better represen-
tation of the thermodynamic data for systems with miseibility

gaps in view of the fact that the radius ratio parameter used in
the Lumsden equation is approximately unity (Yp, + Mg = .993) for
the Pu-Mg system.

For computational purposes, values of the composition for the
liquids in equilibrium were read from a smooth curve drawn through
the experimental data points at temperatures from 650°C to the
consolute point. These values of the composition and the computed
values for A and B are given in Table II1. The activity coefficients
for plutonium and magnesium computed from these values of A and B
are given in Table III. The values marked with an asterisk in
the table are for a hypothetical supercooled liquid which cannot
be obtained in the laboratory.

It is of interest to note that the values of the activity
coefficient for plutonium in the infinitely dilute solution
(Ny, = 1) increase with temperature up to about 950°C and thén
dectease. This behavior is in agreement with the positive
temperature dependence of the activity coefficient for plutonium
in dilute magnesium solutions computed from molten salt-liquid
alloy distribution data.(8) The values of the activity coefficient
reported in the latter study are 11.5 and 12.2 at 700 and 800°C,
respectively, which are in good agreement with the results of
the present computation.

Computed values for the free energy of mixing for 700 to 1000°C
as functions of composition are shown in Figure 2. Straight lines

tangent to the AG 4, curves in the regions of the two minima define
the miscibility gap for each temperature., The rapid closing of

the miscibility gap between 950 and 1000°C is related to a rapid
decrease in the magnitude of the excess free energy between 950

and 1000°C, which is found to be related to unusually large values
of the excess enthalpy and entropy of mixing as seen in Figure 3
for a temperature of 1273°K (1000°C). However, it should be noted
that these estimates of the thermodynamic functions are based on
the experimental data for the miscibility gap; the large change

in their values with temperature above 900°C is a result of the
rapid closing of the miscibility gap. Unfortunately, this region
of the phase diagram is not well established experimentally and,
therefore, the indicated temperature dependence of the thermodynamic
data should be accepted with reservations.

Abstract

A method is presented for the estimation of the solubility of
uranium or plutonium in liquid ternary alloys. This method
requires information on the phase relations and thermodynamics
of the three binary systems. The method also may be used to
determine the approximate stolchiometry of the solid phase in
equilibrium with the liquid alloy. The method is illustrated by
analyses of the experimental data for the solubility of uranium
in liquid zinc-magnesium-uranium and plutonium in liquid zinc-
magnesium-plutonium alloys.

Introduction

Pyrochemical methods for the recovery and purification of
uranium and plutonium have process steps whose effectiveness is
determined by the wvalues of the solubility of these actinides
metals in liquid alloys. For example, the pyrochemical method (1)
for the separation of plutonium from uranium depends on large
differences in their solubility in certain liquid magnesium-rich
alloys. Also, the effectiveness of the salt transport step for
the recovery and purification of uranium and plutonium 2 depends
in part on their solubilities in the donor and acceptor alloys.
The importance of the solubilities of uranium and plutonium in
liquid alloys to the development of pyrochemical processes led to
the thermodynamic analysis which is the subject of this paper.

Solubility

The solubility of uranium or plutonium in a liquid alloy is
defined as the uranium or plutonium content of the liquid alloy,
expressed in either weight percent (wt pct), atomic percent (at pct),
or atom fraction, (at fct), when in equilibrium with a solid (or
another liquid) uranium~ or plutonium-rich phase. This definition
of solubility, which differs from that commonly used by the chemist,
was adopted as a practical expedient during the early pyrochemical
studies when it was not feasible or necessary to completely
characterize the equilibrium solid (or liquid) phase. We also
believe that it is incorrect to state solubilities in liquid
metallic solutions in terms of the formula for the solid phase in
equilibrium with the solution, since the formula of any molecular
entities (species) which may exist (if any do) in the metallic
solutions would not be expected to be related in any simple way
to the formula of the solid phase. However, it is not to be
assumed that information concerning the composition and structure
of the equilibrium solid (or liquid) phase is not needed for the
complete specification of solubility equilibria, but only that this
kind of information is not needed to derive a numerical value for
the solubility which is extremely useful for practical process
development. Indeed, the thermodynamic analysis of solubility
equilibria, which will be presented, requires knowledge of the
composition and thermodynamic properties of the solid (or liquid)
phase in equilibrium with the liquid metallic solutionm.

Binary Systems

Binary systems of uranium or plutonium with low-melting solvent
metals, such as zinc, cadmium, magnesium, will be considered. For
such systems we may represent solubility equilibria by the equation:

MXm(s) 7 M(soln) + mX(soln) (1)

548
where MX is the formula for the solid phase in equilibrium with
the binary liquid alloy of M(U or Pu) and X (Zn, Cd, Mg). The
atom fraction of M in the saturated liquid phase, ﬁﬁ, is given
by the equation: AGf°

s _ m _ s _ s
In xy = —RT In Yy -0 1n ay (2)

in which AGf° is the standard free energy of formation of MX
(ger g—-atom o%mM), Y, 1s the activity coefficient of M, and n
a¥ the activity of X 'in the saturated solution. The reference

ates for M and X used for AGfMX » Y, and a_, must be the same.
Two special cases will be con51dered gn detail: (1) when w=0, i.e.,
pure solid M is the equilibrium solid phase and, (2) when m is
equal to a positive constant over an extended temperature range
("line" compound).

Equilibrium phase: Pure solid U or Pu. For this case, when
pure solid uranium or plutonium is the equilibrium phase, Eq. (2)
becomes s s
xy = vy (3)
If the reference state for vy, is pure super-cooled liquid M, then
Eq. (3) may be written:

In 3y RT s (s) (4)
where AG_ is the free energy of fusion and the partial
excess free energy of M in the liquid solution, both at temperature
T. If the free energies are written in terms of the corresponding
enthalpies and entropies, then Eg( §4) becomes : xs (s)

(AH + HM (AS + S )

s
In Xy = RT . (5)

Since, generally, the quantity (AH + H§s(s)) is positive, the
solubility is found to increase wi ? }ncrease in temperature.
However, in the Cd-U system Hﬁ is negative and has a
larger absoclute value than AH_, thereby leading to a retrograde
sclubility of uranium in liquid cadmium over part of the
temperature range. (This is the only example of a retrograde
solubility which has been reported for a liquid metallic solution.)

If the enthalpy and entropy terms are independent of temperature
and composition, then a plot of the logarithm of the solubility
vs the reciprocal of the absolute temperature may be fit by a
straight line,

If the functional dependence of y,, on at fct and temperature is
known, then the solubility may be computed by solving Eq.S(B) for

; alternatively, if the dependence of the solubility, , on
temperature is known, then the dependence of y,, on at fct and
temperature may be determined provided the form of the fupctional
relation is known. For example, if the Darken equatiomn is
applicable to the binary system, then

where Y is the activity coeff1c1ent of M in the infinitely dilute
solution and o is a constant; both Y and a are temperature
dependent. The reference state for vy, in Eq. (6) is pure solid M.
We were able to estimate the solubility of uranium in liquid cadmium
over the temperature range where pure solid uranium is the
equilibrium phase by the use of this technique;(3) computed values
of the solubility and its retrograde temperature dependence were
in excellent agreement with observed values.

Equilibrium phase: Intermetallic Compounds of U or Pu. For
the case when an intermetallic compound of uranium or plutonium is
the equilibrium phase, Eq. (2) may be modifigd in several ways.

If the solubility is extremely small, then a_, would be expected
to be nearly unity and Eq. (2 educes to the f

and entropy of M in the saturated liquid solution. The forms of
Eq. (7) and Eq. (5) are similar; a plot of the logarithm of the
solubility vs the reciprocal of the absolute temperature is usually
fit by a straight line, although curvature has been found in some
cases. When curvature is observed it is not advisable to attempt
to interpret empirical constants determined from the plot in terms
of variations of the enthalpies or entropiles with temperature or
composition, in view of the approximations made in deriving

Eq. (7).

An exact form of Eq. (2) is obtained by the substitutions

If x> is of the order of 0.0l or less ({.e., 1 at pet) the
detection of differences between Eq. (9) and Eq. (7) will depend
upon the accuracy of the solubility data. It is also to be noted

550
that since the excess quantities are, in general, composition
dependent, caution should be used in the interpretation of the slope
and intercept of linear plots of logarithm of solubility vs 1/T

in terms of differences in enthalpies and entropies. Nevertheless,
plots of the logarithm of the solubility vs 1/T are extremely useful
for the detection of errors in experimental data and for interpo-
lation. Abrupt changes in the slopes of such plots may usually be
interpreted as evidence for changes in the composition of the
equilibrium solid phase. Thus, transformation temperatures, such

as peritectic temperatures, may be estimated from the temperature

at which the line segments intersect. This technique is partic-
ularly useful in those systems in which the transformations may be
sluggish and therefore difficult to determine accurately by the

use of thermal analysis or alloy-annealing methods.

If the free energy of formation of the intermetallic phase and
the dependence of the partial excess free energies on at fct are
known as functions of - temperature, the solubility mey be computed.
An example 1s given in Table I where results are given for the
computation of the solubility of plutonium in liquid Cd-Pu
solutions; these results were comp?t?d from thermodynamic data
derived from galvanic cell studies 6) of the two intermetallics,
PuCd,, and Pqu6. In this system the partial excess free energy
of piutonium was found to be fit by an equation of the form:

Gad = (1= %, 0% (A + Bxy) (10)
where A and B are linear functions of the absolute temperature.
The partial excess free energy of cadmium was derived from Eq. (10)
using the Gibbs~Duhem equation. The free energy of formation of
both PuCd,, and PuCd, are also linear functions of temperature.
These relations were substituted into Eq. (8) and the resulting
transcendental equation solved for xp,, at the temperatures shown
in Table I. Good agreement between observed and calculated values
of the solubility were obtained. These results are presented
only as an example of the application of Eq. (8) to the computa-
tion of the solubility of an intermetallic compound; the good
agreement between computed and observed values of the solubility
was expected since the galvanic cells were operated with one of
the electrodes a saturated liquid alloy. However, the concen-
tration and temperature dependence of the excess free energy
was determined from measurements made on cells with unsaturated
liquid alloy electrodes.

Ternary Systems

Ternary systems of uranium or plutonium with mixtures of two
low-melting solvent metals such as magnesium-zinc or magnesium-
cadmium will be considered. Only the solvent-rich region of the
ternary systems will be treated, although the methods may, in

system, solubility equilibria may be represented by the following
general equation:

lation of values of the solubility using Eq. (12) for the general
case, without the introduction of some simplifying assumptions,
requires extensive thermodynamic data for the csystem and is not of
great practical utility. Fortunately, in the case of the solubility
of plutonium and uranium in mixtures of certain low-melting metals,
a number of methods for the estimation of the required thermodynamic

552
data have been found. To illustrate these methods we shall
discuss in detail the solubility of uranium and plutonium in
liquid zinc-magnesium solvent mixtures.

Uranium Solubility in Liquid Zn-Mg Alloys. Experimental values
of the solubility of uranium in liquid zinc-magnesium alloys are
shown in Fig. 1 as a function of the at fct of magnesium in the
liquid for temperatures of 600, 700 and 800°C. The experimental
data are from the work of A. E,. Martin(7), J. B. Knighton(a) and
coworkers, It 1s seen that the solubility of uranium decreases
initially, passes through a minimum value, increases to a sharp
maximum and then decreases smoothly with increase in the at fct
of magnesium in the liquid solution. The sharp maximum in the
solubility is seen to move toward smaller wvalues of the at fct
of magnesium as the temperature 1s increased. The region to the
left of the sharp break corresponds to a part of the ternary
system in which the equilibrium uranium-rich solid phase 1s a
uranium-zinc intermetallic compound, whereas in the region to the
right of the break the equilibrium uranium-rich solid phase is
pure metallic uranium. The sharp break corresponds to the
peritectic reaction

Uzn_(s) < U{s) + nZn (sat'd soln). (13)

Since the liquid phase is in equilibrium with pure metallic
uranium, the activity of uranium is equal to unity both at the
maximum and along the solubility line to the right., As the
temperature is increased, the stability of the uranium-zinc
intermetallic compound is decreased and, therefore, the equilibrium
represented by Eq. (13) occurs at greater zinc concentrations,
i.e., lower at fct of magnesium,

The equilibrium corresponding to the solubility line to the
left of the break point is

We have found that the solubility of vuranium in liquid zinc-
magnesium-uranium solutions may be estimated by assuming that
(1) the activity coefficient of uranium in the solution is the
geometric mean of the values for zinc-uranium and magnesium-uranium
solutions and that (2) the activity of zinc in the sclution is
equal to the value for a binary zinc-magnesium solution of the
same zinc concentration. The first assumption may be written

s—
1n Yy = xann YU,Zn + ng In YU,Mg (18)

where vy 7n @0d Yy,Mg are the activity coefficients of uranium in
binary zinc-uranium solutions, respectively. The solubility of
uranium in liquid zinc-magnesium solutions was estimated using

Eq. (15), (17) and (18). The standard free-energy of formation of
the uranium-zinc intermetallic compound, AGfﬁ n.? was compu%sg
from the results of high temperature galvanic ¢Bll studies.

The results from these same galvanic cell studies were used to
compute the activity coefficient of uranium, yg Zn» 1o liquid
binary zinc-uranlum sclutions. The activity coefficient of
uranium in liquid magnesium—-uranium sclutions, Yy .Me> Was computed
from the data for the solubility of uranium in li&u%d magnesium. 10)
The zinc activities were computed from the equation reported by
Chiotti and Stevens(11) for the ZIn-Mg system.

Unfortunately, the formula for the intermetallic phase has not
been unambiguously established. Studies of the zinc-uranium
system at Argonne National Laboratory(lz) have established the
existence of two or more intermetallic compounds whose formulae
probably range from UZny, to Uing 5. These compounds appear to
differ only slightly in stability and, therefore, it has not
been possible to determine exactly the formula of the equilibrium
solid phase (in the binary zinc-uranium sgstem) as a function of
temperature. The galvanic cell studies ) of the temperature
dependence of the free energy of formation of the intermetallic
compound in equilibrium with the liquid phase, which ranged from
just above the melting point of zinc (420°C) to about 700°C, did
not indicate significant changes. Sharp changes in the temperature
dependence would be expected if there had been different equilibrium
intermetallic phases present which differed significantly in
stability. To compute the solubility we have tried values of n
between 8,5 and 12; the best agreement between observed and
calculated values of the solubility was obtained with wvalues
of n between 8.5 and 9.5. It should be noted that it is possible,
and highly probable, that the formula of the equilibrium solid
intermetallic phase will depend on the zinc activity in the liquid
solution. We would expect this variation of the formula to take
place in discrete steps, with the value of n decreasing as the
activity of zinc in the solution is decreased. Consequently,
the value of n which is found to correspond to the best fit to
the solubility data may be an average of the values for the several
intermetallics involved.

555
The results of computations of the solubility of uranium at 600°C
in liquid zinc-magnesium-uranium solutions are shown in Fig. 2. It
is seen that the best agreement between computed and observed values
of the solubility is obtained for a value of n between 8.5 and 8.75.
The greatest differences between computed and observed values occur
in the regions of the minimum and the sharp maximum in the solubility.
The difference in the region of the minimum is probably mostly
caused by the use of a value of n too small for the region of high
zinc activity. To correct for this difference would require the
computation of the initial part of the solubility using one value
of n and the latter part using a second value of n. The obvious
scatter of the experimental data (probably caused in part by a lack
of equilibrium between the solid phase and the liquid phase when the
latter was sampled for analysis in the solubility measurements)
makes a meaningful computation of this type impossible. The over-
estimate of the solubility in the region of the sharp maximum is
believed due to the failure of Eq. (18) to accurately predict the
activity coefficient of uranium in the liquid solution. It is,
in fact, surprising that this simple equation works as well as it
does. A somewhat better estimate of the solubilit{3§an be made by

using the approximation %}z§t suggested by Darken ( and later

by Alcock and Richardson for the activityxgoefficient:
AG
5 = _ _Zn-Mg
Inoy, = %5010 Yy,zn T %™ Yu,ug T TET (19)

where AG;E_ is the excess free energy of mixing of the binary
zinc—magnes%ﬁm solvent system. This latter term was computed from
the equation given by Chiotti and Stevens. 1 It is seen (dashed
lines of Fig. 2) that for a value of n = 9.2 a somewhat better
overall agreement between computed and observed solubility values
is obtained when the D=A-R approximation Eq. (19) is used for

1n Y3, rather than the geometric mean approximation, Eq. (18).
However, neither of these approximations take into account the
possible dependence of the activity coefficient of uranium on the
uranium concentration. If some thermodynamic data for the ternary
system were available, then the relation reported by Darken{(l3
could be used to estimate Y in the liquid zinc-magnesium-uranium
solutions. Better estimates for the activity of zinc in the ternary
solutions would then also be available.

Lacking sufficient data on the ternary system to apglg the
thermodynamically exact quadratic formalism of Darken, 15) we
have studied the utility of a less exact treatment, which is

similar to the "interaction parameter" formalism of Wagner. (16)
Thus, in place of either Eq. (18) or (19) is written

in liquid zinc and magnesium, respectively, at the limit of zero
uranium concentration and a is a constant ("self interaction
parameter'). All three parameters are functions of temperature.
The constant a may be determined from one value of the activity
coefficient of uranium in a ternary solution (for example, one
value of the solubility in the ternary system to the right of the
break), if values for the activity coefficients in the two binary
systems are known. We have tested the utility of Eq. (20) by the
computation of the solubility of uranium in zinc-magnesium-uranium
solutions at 800°C. The comparison of the observed and computed
values of the solubility shown in Fig. 3 indicates that Eq. (20)
is a good approximation to use for this system.

Scolubility of Plutonium in Liguid Zn-Mg Alloys. The solubility
of plutonium in liquid zinc-magnesium alloys has been measured by
Knighton and coworkers. (17) Qualitatively, the solubility in the
zinc-rich region 1s similar to that observed in the region to the
left of the maximum in the U-Zn-Mg system, i.e., the solubility
decreases initially, passes through a minimum value and then
increases with increasing magnesium concentration. In this
region of the phase diagram various plutonium-zinc intermetallic
phases are found to be in equilibrium with the liquid Zn-Mg-Pu
alloys.

Several studies of the plutonium-zinc system have been re-
ported(18'21). Cramer and Wood(21) report that there are at least
five distinct phases in the most zinc-rich region of the system.
One of these phases, which melts congruently at 928°C, is PuyZnyy
(Th,2n;4 rhombohedral structure). On the plutonium-rich side of
Pu,Zn;, is a phase Puiny z; the crystal structure of which has
recentiy been reported.(2 ) Cramer and Wood reported three phases
on the zinc-rich side of PuyZnjy;  However, they did not establish
the exact stoichiometry of these phases but indicated that two of
the phases may be polymorphs of a single phase. They reported
transformations at 700, 770 and 811°C, and considered the trans-
formation at 770°C to be a polymorphic transformation. It would
appear that the Pu-Zn system is similar to the U-Zn system in the
zinc-rich region but that the stability of the various Pu-Zn
compounds is enough different that transformations readily occur
between them and may be detected using thermal analysis methods.

We attempted to estimate the solubility of plutonium in liquid
Zn-Mg solutions using Eq. (15) and (18) with the appropriate
values of the parameters for the Pu-Zn and Pu-Mg systems. No
single value of n could be found which would allow the solubility
at 600 and 700°C to be computed over the entire magnesium concen-
tration range of the solubility measurements (0-0.42 at fct at
600°C; 0-0.28 at fct at 700°C).

To establish the apparent formula for the equilibrium solid
phase for each range of magnesium concentration we have used the

558
following method. The value of the activity coefficient of
plutonium for each composition was computed from the solubility
data using Eq. (15) rearranged in the form

s AGfIo’uZ s
1in Ypy = TRT - 1n Xpy = 1n a, s (21)
where AGfp was computed from the thermodynamic data for the Pu-

Zn system%%%?n and ay, from the data of Chiotti and Stevens 1

for the Zn-Mg system. The activity coefficient of plutonium in the
liquid alloys may also be computed from the data for the distribution
of plutonium between a molten salt mixture (50 mol pct MgCl,-30 mol
pct NaCl-20 mol pct KCl) and liquid Zn-Mg-Pu solutions. The chemical
reaction for distribution equilibria is:

PuCl,(salt) + 3/2 Mg(alloy) < Pu(alloy) + 3/2 MgCl, (salt) (22)
hence,
= - 1]
1n Ypu In D + 3/2 1n aMg In Ka (23)

where yp,, is the activity coefficient of plutonium in the liquid
alloy, D, the distribution coefficient (mol fct PuClg in salt/

at fct Pu in alloy) and K] = K, YPuclq M [K, is the thermo-
dynamic (activity) equilibrium constant f8F feaction (22), Ypyc1
the activity coefficient of PuClj, and ay c1 the activity of 3
MgCl, in the molten salt]. The value of Ea aas established from
the value for yp, in the binary Pu-Zn system, as has been discussed
in detail elsewhere.(23) The values of n and AGfﬁuZn which gave
the best agreement between values of Ypy computed usiﬁg Eq. (21)
and (23) were determined graphically, as illustrated in Fig. 4.
Values of 1In Ypy Were comguted from the distribution data (the

data previously reported( 3) were combined with more recent data
obtained by Knighton(ZA)) and are shown by the open circles and the
straight line in Fig. 4. Values of 1ln Yp, Were then computed using
Eq. (21) and the solubility data with values of n between 8.5 and
12, The value of AGfﬁuznn was computed from the thermodynamic data
for the Pu-Zn system.(20) Values of 1ln Yp, computed using values
of n =11 and 8.5 are shown on Fig. 4. It 1s seen that the values
of 1n yp, computed using n = 11 (shown as diamonds) are in good
agreement with the straight line up to about = 0.2 but
systematically deviate from the straight linexggove XMg = 0.2,
Above %y, = 0.2, values of 1n YPu (shown as triangles) computed
using n = 8.5 are seen to lie below the straight line by a nearly
constant quantity. If the value of AGfp,y, 1s increased by about
1300 cal/mole, the values of ln yp, computeg using Eq. (21) and

n = 8.5 are seen (as squares) to be in good agreement with the
straight line. We conclude that, at 600°C, the formula for the
solid phase in equilibrium with liquid Zn-Mg-Pu alloys in the
composition range 0 < <0.2 is PuZnjj and in the composition
range 0.2 <ng < 0.43 is Pulng ¢ (Pu22n17). At XMg = 0.2 two

represented by the peritectic reaction:

Puanl(s) b 1/2 Pu2Zn17 (s) + 2.5 Zn (ng = 0,2) (24)

According to Eq. (24) the difference in the standard free energies
of formation of the two compounds is equal to 2.5 RT In az . which
quantity is equal to 1300 cal/g-atom for xy = 0.18, in good
agreement with the value x¥ = 0.2 derived Ey inspection of Fig. 4.
The value of the standard %ee energy of formation of 1/2 PuZZn17
is more positive than the value for PuZn;; as would be expected

if PuZnj; is the equilibrium phase in the binary Zn-Pu system.

A similar computation using the solubility and distribution
data for 700°C showed that PuZnj; is the equilibrium solid phase
in the composition range 0 s <0,16 and PuyZnyy in the composi-
tion range 0.16 <x, < 0.26. e difference in the standard free
energies of formation for the two intermetallic compounds was
found to be 1040 cal/g-atom, At 800°C it was found that PuyZnjyy
1s the equilibrium solid phase over the composition range
0 < Xy, S 0.18 (0.18 is the 1limit of the solubility data at 800°C).
The stgndard free energy of formation of PusZnjy was found to be
940 cal/g-atom Pu more negative than the value for PuZnj; at 800°C.
Thus, PuyZn,, is the formula for the solid phase in equilibrium with
liquid Zn-Pu and Zn-Mg-Pu solutions at 800°C. The peritectic
temperature [Eq. (24)] in the Pu-Zn system is estimated to be 765°C.

These two examples illustrate the utility of relatively simple
methods for the estimation of the solubility of uranium or plutonium
in ternmary liquid alloys and for the determination of the approximate
stoichiometry of the equilibrium solid uranium- or plutonium-rich
phases. We have also used these methods for the analysis of experi-
mental data for the solubility of uranium in liquid cadmium-magnesium-
uranium and cadmium-zinc-uranium alloys. In the latter case the
analysis of the solubility data indicated that in cadmium-rich liquid
cadmium-zinc-uranium alloys the equilibrium solid phase had to be a
ternary intermetallic compound, a conclusion that was subsequently
proven by x-ray diffraction and electron microprobe investigations.(zs)

Los Alamos, New Mexico 87544, United States of America

The partial molar enthalpies of solution, AH;(-, have been calculated
for selected elements in liquid (Plutonium from solubility data over the
temperature range 700 to 1000 C. The enthalpies of solution of vanadium,
chromium, niobium, molybdenum, tantalum, and tungsten were calculated
from regular solution theory by the equation

AH¥ = TAS.-RTInN, ,
i f i

where T is the absolute temperature, ASf is the entropy of fusion of i at the
normal melting temperature, R is the gas constant, and N; is the mole
fraction of solute i in a saturated solution at temperature T. The enthalpies
of solution of tungsten and tantalum in gixteen liquid rare-earth metals were
also calculated by this equation. Solubility parameters, 0., were calculated
from these enthalpies by the formula
AHi* - AHf /9

where &g is the square-root of the cohesive density of the solvent, AH; is
the enthalpy of fusion, and V; is the molar volume of the solute. Finally,
partial molar enthalpies of solution of carbon, titanium, zirconium, thulium,

Introduction

The solubilities of selected elements in liquid plutonium have been of
continued interest in this Laboratory.( 1,2) The individual solubilities of
carbon, titanium, vanadium, chromium, zirconium, niobium,
molybdenum, thulium, tantalum, tungsten, and rhenium have been measured
under reversible conditions from 700 to 1000°C., The binary systems
plutonium-vanadium, -chromium, -niobium, -molybdenum, -tantalum,
and -tungsten are simple eutectic-types.(3) The other elements form either
compounds or solid solutions with plutonium in the temperature and compo-
sition range of interest.(3-5) The solubilities and the solid phases in
equilibrium with the liquid solution at 850°C are given in Table I.

Partial molar enthalpies of solution can be calculated for these solutes
from basic thermodynamic principles provided that several limiting
assumptions are adopted. Similar calculations can be applied to other
binary systems; for example, partial enthalpies of solution for tungsten
and tantalum in the liquid rare-earth metals can be calculated from the
solubility measurements on these systems.(si 7) These partial molar
enthalpies of solution should prove useful in estimating solubilities and the
relative order of solubility in a series of related solvents. The enthalpies
should be applicable to corrosion technology, heat transfer studies, casting
and processing procedures, and to liquid fuels programs. The estimates
are approximate and should not replace measurements where quantitative
data are required.

Discussion

The Derivation of a Solubility Equation. For a binary system composed
of solute A and liquid solvent B, the reaction

A(s) + B{) = B (£, sat'd with A) (1)

can be written to represent the equilibrium between excess solid A and
liquid solution.

In general, this equilibrium can also be expressed as
RinN, = (AS + AS) - (AH + AH ") /T (2)

where R is the gas constant, N, is the mole fraction of solute i in a

saturated solution at absolute temperature, T, AS¢ and AHg are the entropy and
enthalpy of fusion of i, and AS *® and AH? are the excess entropy and
enthalpy of solution of the solute in the solvent of interest. {

Equation (2) is valid if the activity coefficient is constant within the
limits of composition and temperature under consideration, if the heat
capacities of the solid solute and the super~cooled liquid solute are equal
at the temperature of interest; and, if the only phase change between the
given temperature and that of fusion of the solute is melting.

The enthalpy term in Eq. (2) is a function of composition so that
AR =(1-N)%a (3)
where & is a constant. Consequently, a correction would be necessary if
very accurate values of the enthalpy term are desired. For most of these
systems, however, this correction can be neglected.

If an empirical approach to solubility theory is adopted, both the excess
entropy and enthalpy terms must be evaluated. Equation (2) becomes

567
RlnNi=Ai—Bi/T . (4)

where the total entropy of solution (ASf‘*‘ Ag?s) is designated as A and the

total enthalpy (AHf + AH.XS) as By. These constants were calculated from
the solubility data for each solute by least sqaures computations. The
standard deviation computed for each equation was less than 0.1 over a
three- to ten-fold change in the concentration of the solute in a 250° to 300°
temperature range. Values for Aj and B, are listed in Table IL

Quasi-Chemical Approach to Solubility. The excess enthalpy term, Aﬁ};s,

and the difference between ideal and regular solutions can be illustrated
by the quasi-chemical approach to bond energies. It can be shown that

568
s
AHC=-ENN N_|E_ -5 , (6)
where 2 is the number of neighbors of each solute atom, N is Avogardro's
number, Np is the mole fraction solvent, and Ejp, E;;, and Epp represent
the potential interaction energies between solute-solvent, solute-solute,

and solvent-solvent pairs, respectively. In liguid solutions, 2 is the
average value for the coordination number. By differentiation of Eq (6),

in dilute solution

=XS ii
AH, =- 2N Ex- 5 (7)
In an ideal solution Eip is equal to the average of Eij plus Egg. In regular
solutions these terms are not equal and the excess enthalpy of solution will
depend upon the relative magnitudes of these interaction energies.

Solubility Parameters. Hildebrand and Scott have proposed solubility
parameters based upon relations between molar volumes and bonding
energies. _ Their equation for the partial molar excess enthalpy of
solution AH}i( is

are-vl (2 ) (=2 p

2 _ 7 _ 2
A N = 2=V, 008 (8)

where \71 and \_ZB are the molar volumes of solute and solvent; EZ and EV

are the energies of vaporization; and, o g is the volume fraction of B,
which is generally one in dilute solutions. Hildebrand and Scott point out
that metal solutions provide an excellent means of testing Eq (8) because
of rather large changes in parameters such as the molar volume, This
equation, however, will not be valid when interatomic bonding occurs; the
basic assumptions in deriving Eq (8) include the validity of the geometric
mean law and the dissociation of the solute into the solution. The values

of (Ev/“\F)l/2 are commonly designated as solubility parameters; because
of the approximations in deriving Eq (8), values of AHi calculated by
this method will be inexact.

Enthalpies of Solution of Solutes Which Form Simple-Eutectics With
Plutonium. The equilibrium reactions of plutonium with vanadium,
chromium, niobium, molybdenum, tantalum, and tungsten can be expressed
by the equation

A(s) + Pu(g) = Pu(d, sat'd with A), (9)

where A is the solute element i. Measurements of the individual solubilities

569
of these elements were made upon approach to saturation from both over-
and under-saturated conditions. ¢ 1, 2€ The solute concentration at each
temperature, over a series of measurements, was independent of the
container material and the direction of approach to equilibrium. The
variation in average values at each temperature was less than three
relative percent.

The entropies of fusion of these solute elements are 2.3 e. w.{11) This
value was used with the solubility data to calculate the partial enthalpies of
solution by Eq (5). The calculated enthalpies were independent of
temperature. Average values are given in Table III. The average correction
factors in the enthalpies, as calculated by Eq (3), are also given in this
Table. This correction is insignificant for tungsten and tantalum; it is
0.2 kecal/mole for niobium and molybdenum; 0.3 kcal/mole for vanadium;
and 0, 4 kcal/mole for chromium. Thus, the correction is less than 5
percent in every case.

Enthalpies of Solution of Tantalum and Tungsten in Liquid Rare-Earth

Gschneidner measured the solubilities of tungsten and tantalum in sixteen
rare-earth metals over the temperature range 1325 to 215000.(6’7) Using
their data, enthalpies of solution were calculated by Eq (5). Average
enthalpies are given in Table IV. The solubility increases in order from
ytterbium to scandium as shown by decreasing AH{>F values for both solutes
except for one-position changes for tantalum in terbium and holmium.

Enthalpies of Elements Which Form Solid Solutions with Plutonium. Both
zirconium and titanium form solid solutions with plutonium from 700 to
1000°C. The equilibrium reaction for zirconium is

€-Pu (s, sat'd with Zr) + Pu(4) = Pu(k, sat'd with Zr); (17)
for titanium, the reaction below 770°C is

€-Pu (s, sat'd with Ti) ¥+ Pu(2) = Pu(4, sat'd with Ti); (18)
and for titanium above 770°C

B~Ti (s, sat'd with Pu) + Pu(4 )= Pu(4, sat'd with Ti). (19)
Since the excess enthalpy terms are absorbed in Aﬁi*, the principle

thermodynamic difference in these solutions from simple eutectic systems
can be attributed to the configurational entropy in the solid solution. This

term is - R In Nis, where Nis is the mole fraction of solute i in a saturated

solid solution at a given temperature. The derivation of the basic solubility
equation under these conditions results in the expression

AH™ =TAS,-R|InN>-InN, | , (20)
i f i i

573
where AI—{i** is equal to Aﬁixs/ [1- Ni:\2 + AHf .

Values for N.° for zirconium and titanium were estimated from the
ph_ggg diagrams. {4,5,13) Ppartial molar enthalpies of liquid solution
AH;  were calculated by Eq (20). The enthalpy of the plutonium-zirconium
system was 4.2 % 0,1 kcal/mole from 700 to 950°C. The enthalpy of liquid
solution for the titanium-plutonium system was 4.1+ 0,1 kecal/mole from
700 to 75000 and 5.3 £ 0.1 kecal/mole from 800 to 1000°C. The average
correction factors for these enthalpies, as calculated by Eq (3), range
from 0.5 to 0.8. However, estimates of solid phase solubilities are also
approximate, and the AH; values are limited to the significance of Eq (20).
The shift in the titanium enthalpy was attributed to the change in the solid
phase at 77 0°c. Solubility parameters were not calculated because of the
formation of solid solutions in these systems.

Conclusions

In this paper, enthalpy values have been calculated from solubility
data by utilizing regular solution theory. Since solubility is an exponential
function of the difference between the entropy and enthalpy divided by the
absolute temperature, small errors in the solubility data may result in
significant deviations in the latter. The approximate enthalpies can be
used for qualitative estimates of solubility; refined estimates are possible
with the correction factors. However, it remains necessary to measure
the solubilities under the conditions of interest to obtain guantitative data,

Abstract

Fundamental theories of ternary systems will be reviewed with a
discussion of the simi;aritigs and differences between terg re- _
ciprocal systems (A ,B /X ,Y ) additive ternary systems (A ,B ,C /X )
and metallic systems. In dilute solutions of two components one may
define association constants between pairs of ions in terms of funda-
mental energy parameters. In concentrated solutions, deviations
from ideal solution behavior are related to non-random mixing.
Theoretical criteria for the predicticn of phase diagram behavior,
solubilities, extraction behavior, liquid-liquid misecibility, and
other thermodynamic properties important in pyrometallurgical
processing will be presented for simple systems.

Introduction

Pyrometallurgical processing is generally carried out in multi-
component systems and an understanding of theoreticasl concepts is
necessary to define and optimize processing methods. In this review
we shall first discuss theories of ternary systems, which are the
simplest members of the class of multicomponent systems. Our dis-
cussion applies equally to molten salt systems and to metallie
systems for which there have been parallel developments of funda-
mental concepts. The extension of the concepts discussed to higher
order multicomponent systems is straightforward. In the last section
we will present some examples of chemical behavior in systems which
illustrate the theoretical concepts.

Ternary molten salt systems consist oi fgur_iogs: a system con-
sisting of two cations and two anions (A ,B /X ,Y ) is a ternary
reciprocal system and one consisting of three citigns_agd cne anion
(AT,BT,CT/X") or three anions and one cation (A /X ,Y Z ) is an
additive ternary system. The metallic systems which are analogous to
these can be understood if one forma$1y+co§sigers electrons (e ) as
anions. Then interstitial alloys (A ,B /e ,X )+ar$ eguigalent to
reciprocal systems and substitutional alloys (A ,B ,C /e ) are equiv-
alent to additive systems. The theories which have been developed
for molten salts and for alloy systems should exhibit many similarities
and aside from specific differences in the models, many of the derived
relationships are equivalent. We shall discuss thermodynamic theories
for phenomena as phase diagram behavior, solubilities, extraction,
and liquid-liquid miscibility which are important in pyrometallurgical
processing.

Definitions

To establish a framework for discussion several quentities need
to be defined. The chemical behavior of a compconent in solution is,
of course, determined by its chemical potential, p, which has the
undesirable mathematical property that it approaches -« as the con-
centration of the component approaches zero. This property is cir-
cumvented by defining another guantity, the activity, a, which
usually lies in the range of C to 1]

u=u° + RT 2n a

where u° is the chemical potential of the pure component. To make
the definition of activity more meaningful one must intrecduce
relationships which cannot be derived purely thermodynamically but
require the introduction of statistical ¢oncepts. The simplest
relationship for molten saelts depends g¢n the definition of an ideal
solution as first discussed by Temkin.(:) The activity of an ideal
solution of a salt Aan is defined as

n
8iq = NIXNX

580
where NA is the caticen fraction of A and N, is the anion fraction

of X X
_ A N o X
A In X In
cations anions

where n are the number of moles of the ions indicated. For
interstitial alloys there are analogous relaticns. For additive
ternary systems and substitutional alloys either NA or NX is unity.

A1} real solutions deviate from ideal solutions. This deviatien
is characterized by the activity coefficient y such that

vy = (a/aid) = (a/NiNﬁ)

If the ideal solution is defined in a way which is consistent with
the limiting laws, then vy will always be a positive finite number.

In sddition to the definition of y there are severaml other quantities
which are often utilized to characterize deviations from ideal
soluticn behavior:

The molar excess free energy GE = RTZNiﬁnYi
all
components

The partial molar excess free energy of a component i

&® = BT an Y,
1 1

The molar enthalpy of mixing AHm =H- ENiHi

and the partial molar enthalpy of sclution

E B(EE/T) BAHHA
i - /Ty anij

All these quantities are interrelated and often parallel each cther.

Solutions Dilute in Two Components

The thermodynamic solubility products (K,,) end enthalpies of
solution (AHgo1y,,) of an insoluble salt can be predicted for reciprocal
gystems and interstitial alloy systems by the us?2?€3§(ﬁimple cycle

Consequently
-RT 2n K, = 8G) + AG?T + AG3T (4)
and
BH, .= AH) + AHp + AHj (5)

where the superscript ST signifies standard states. If data are
available for the reaction (1), then one may calculate X

and AH from a knowledge of steps (2) and (3) which involve
only bggagi systems. The complexity of the problem is thus
reduced from that of understanding a large number of ternary
systems to understanding a much smaller number of binary systems
for whichthereare generally more available data or where
reasonable estimates may often be made. The use of this cycle
for calculating K. and AH has been tested for the dis-
solution of silveP halides®$fi'molten alkali nitrates. The results
in Table I show good agreement between measured and calculated
values.

A similar cycle can be applied to metallic systems, e.g. to the
calceulation of the solubility product of the oxides of one metal in
solution in another metal. This cycle is most useful where step
(1) ?aﬁes the largest contributions to the totals in egquations (L)
and (5),

Only for special cases in which activity coefficient cor-
rections are negligible can one deduce solubilities directly
from solubility products. Generally, theions of insoluble salts
tend to associate in solution and form clusters and ion pairs.
This leads to significant negative deviations from ideal solution
behavior which must be taken into account in order to calculate
truesolubilities. Figure 1 illustrates this for a case in which
the corrections are relatively small. If a solution of Ag and
€2  ion in molten KNOj were ideal, then the solubility of AgCR
would be equal to the activity of AgNO3 and of KC& (the activities

The solubility of AgCLf is higher than these activities as the result
of the formation of associated species in solution as

AgT + 027 = AgCe (6)
AgCL + C&~ = AgCy (1)
AgCa + Ag' = agycet (8)

which make the activity coefficients of AgNO3 and KCL in solution less
than unity. The fact that the plotted activities of AgN03 are higher
than those of KC&, even though the concentration of Ag eqguals that

of C& , indicates that equilibria as (7) which form species containing
more chloride ions than silver ions have larger association constants
than equilibria as (8). In many other cases the activity coefficients
are so low that sclubilities are orders of magnitude higher than for
an ideal solution. This is true not only for reciprocal molten sslt
systems but also for ternary interstitial metallic systems. Con-
sequently, it is important to understand association equilibrias in
dilute solutions and the influence of these equilibria on the con-
centration dependence of activity coefficients.

Let us consider a solvent BY dilute in A+ and X ions.  For
metallic systems, Y 1is an electron. The association of A and X
to form an A -X pair may be visualized as in the two dimensional
representation of Figure 2. The interchange of the circled X and Y
ions gives rise to a specific bond free energy change AA;. From the
statistical mechanical analysis of a quasi-lattice model it can be
shown that K;, the asso?%%f%?TTsonstant for the equilibrium A +X % AX
in Figure 2 is given by

K; = Z(exp(-AL;/RT)-1) (9}

where Z is a coordinstion number which ranges from sbout L-6 for molten
salts. In reciprocal systems and interstitial systems, AA;, is largely
related toc the exchange of nearest neighbors. In simple systems where
long range interactions do not predominate and where A and X are
simple spherical ions one might expect that 44 is independent of
temperature and is truly an energy AE;. In order to test this, one

mast make measurements over a wide range of temperatures.

The calculation of K; from experimental data on the activity coef-
ficients of the components AY or BX can be simply made for the case
in which all components and species at low concentrations obey Henry's
law. Then it can be shown that

For metallic sclutions K; is the ?e%ative of the atomic intefacgion
coefficients introduced by Wagner'9) and Chipman and+Elliott 10/,
Figure 3 exhibits some of the data for the system Ag + CL” in NalNO 3
which have been utilized in conJuncEion with equation (12) to
evaluate K; for the formation of Ag - €%~ ion pairs over a range
of temperatures.

Y?luT? og 4A; derived from such measurements at several temperatures
(11)(12)(13 are given in Table II and are independent of temperature
within experimental errors for all reasonable values of the coordination
number. Consequently, equation (9) can be used to predict the tem-
perature coefficients of K; where A and X~ are simple spherical ions.
Similar data hayg been obtained for metellic systems as shown in

Figures 4 and 5 ) and Table II1I{14) yhere the interaction coefficients
ki = -K;. An extensive check of the temperature dependence of AA,

foé metallic systems has not been made but AA; appears to be temperature
independent in some of the measurements which have been made (see
Figures % and 5 from reference 6). More complete tests would help to
confirm this. The quasi lattice model also leads to expressions for

the higher association constants(5)(T) which are somewhat more complex.,

Similar equations o}? f?r edditive molten salt systems and for
substitutional alloys TI{15) with a modification in the definition of
AA; which is the specific free energy change for the exchange of next
nearest neighbors (considering electrons as anions). This modifi-
cation is illustrated in the two dimensional model in Figure 6
which illustrates the associmtion of next nearest neighbor cations

B++c+i_rB+_C+

An important conclusion may be deduced from equation (9). If AA,
is zero, then K; is zero. If AA; is negative, then the two ions
involved associate and K; can be a large number if AA; is very negative.
On the other hand, if AA; is positive, it means that the "associating"
ions repel each other which leads to negative values of K;. This
pecularity is paralleled by the behavior of second virial coefficients
of some gases (which are the negative of association constants) and

it arises because of the definition of an ideal solution in which

K; is zero for the random number of pairs (N NX in reciprocal systems
or NBN in additive systems). If these pairs of ions repel each
othe? Ehen K; < 0. An examinetion of equation (9) for positive
values of AA) shows that the most negative value of K, possible is
-Z. Thus, the positive values of K| have no fundamental limit but
the negative values do. In dilute solution, this means that it is
easier to lower than to raise activity coefficients of solutes sig-
nificantly by the addition of a third constituent. This is con-
sistent with much of the data on metallic systems where values of K;
(the negative of the Wagner coeffi?iﬁ?t k,,) range from very large
numbers to small negative numbers. 1 Tﬁg only wvalue of K| less than
-12 in Table III taken from reference (14) is questionable.

A precise estimate of AA; is not possible at present but relative
values for similar compounds may be often guessed from the crude
assumption of additivity. If pair bonds are additive then for

Of course, real systems dc not exhibit this additivity so that
equation {13} may be used only for crude guesses. Analogous relations
held for interstitial alloys. DNonadditivity is manifested in yet
another way. If one lecoks at the eguilibrium (7) for the association
of a second chloride ion with a silver icn, if there is no contri-
bution to the bond free energy which is related to the non-ideality
of the AgNO3-MNO3 and MCR-MNO3 binary systems, then additivity of
pair bond interactions means that the specific bond free energy {03

Solutions Dilute in One Component

The theory for calculations of solutions of one component in
dilute solutj olvent has been discussed in several
papers. (6)( lé??l7? 19?%7?TK5? With minor differences in the
definition of the parameters, one obtains the same relations for
reciprocal and sdditive ternary mixtures. All of the calculations
are based upcn the additivity of pair bond interactions, and, to
the degree that there are deviations from this, real systems might
be expected to deviate from theoretical celculations. Even for
those cases where such deviations are considerable, theory pro-
vides an understanding of the parameters and phenomena which govern
solution behavior and ensbles one to make semiguantitative pre-
dictions.

The theoretical equations can be expressed in several different
forms, each of which provides & different insight into the problem.
Hagemark has derived expressions for ternag¥ s¥stem5 at any com-
position from the quasi-chemical theory 1 for the additive
ternary system AX-BX-CX (or A-B-C). In the limit of N, -~ O an
expression from his general equations for the activity coefficient

but may deviate from this in reaﬁ sys%ems. The function ¢(NA) is

generally smell, and is Zero when N, or NB = 0. Consequently,
when the binary system AX-BX exhibits very large deviations from
ideal solution behavior, -G (AB) has a large maximum or minimum
which is to be added to the linear terms. Such behavior may have
& prefound influence on the chemical behavior of components in
pyrometallurgical processes. We will illustrate this behavior in
a later section. The term ¢ tends to lower the maxima or minima
to an extent which depends solely on K. Equation (17) may be
rewritten for reciprocal systems and is equivalent to limiting
forms which can be ?er%ved from the gquasi-lattice theory for
reciprocal systems. 17 For the component AX in dilute solution

equivalent to the Flood, ?¢rland and Grjotheim cycle. 2)

Equations (25) and (17) can be seen to be equivalent if Ypx in

Concentrated Solutions

The thermodynamic properties of concentrated ternary solutions have
been treated %S Shree papers utilizing perturbation theory for recig—
rocal systems 1’ and the quasi~chemical approach for reciprocal(l7
and additive ternary systems,(l5) These theories provide a funda-
mental Justification for many of the equilibrium chemical properties
and provide a means for the prediction of chemical behavier, phase
diagrams, and of liquid-liquid miscibility. Although these theories
apply only to simple systems, they enable us to understand the basis
for the behavior of more complex systems.

Since the theory is only second order, it is not exact for cases

in which AG™ > ZRT or where regular solution theory expressed by
equations as {28) are grossly incorrect. Despite the deviations

of real systems from the assumptions in the theory, this theory

can be useful in helping to understand and predict thermodynsmic
behavior when the deviations from the assumptions are not gross.

For example, the liquidus temperatures of the Li, §||F, Ci system
calculated from conformal ionic solution theory are given in
Figure T and can be seen to correspond well with the measured
liquidus temperatures shown in Figure 8. A close examination of
the relation between the calculated liquidus temperatures and the
parameters in the theory provides considerable insight into under-
standing phase diagrams of such systems. For example, the magnitude
of the bowing cut of the isotherms for LiF from the LiF corner

is related to the magnitude of AGY and to the fact that LiF is a
member of the stable pair of salts (LiF + KC&). The large phase
field of LiF and the small one for KF 1s related to the fact that

LiF 1s a member of the stable pair of salts and exhibits positive
deviations from i1deal solution behavior whereas KF 1s a member of
the unstable pair (KF + Li1C%) and exhibits negative deviations from
1deal behavior. The extension of the KCR phase field in the di-
rection of the LiF-KF binary 1s related to the large negative value
of ALiKF' Similar rationalizations may be made for other systems.
If we examine equation (27) more carefully, we may relate each
of the terms to less general prior concepts. T?e first term has
been discussed by Floed, Férland, and Grjotheim 2) and has been
related to nearest neighbor cation-anion interactions. The next
four terms were first proposed by Férland 23a)yho related them to
next nearest neighbor cation-cation or anion-anion ilnteractions.
The last term 1s a correction for non-random mixing analogous to g
similar term in the quasi-lattice theory. 17 The significance of
non-random leln% can be seen in Figure 9 2 in which RT Rn Y 18
plotted versus N for the LiF-KCL quasi-binary system. Elne
calculated withouf the inclusion of the kst term of equatlon (27)
deviates from the plotted points which were calculated from
liquidus temperatures. The inclusicn of the non-random mixing term
leads to an "S" shaped curve which corresponds to the measurements.
The non-random mixing alters the concentration dependence of the

consolute temperatures, T , (below which the solution at some com-
position separates 1nto tWo separate liguid phases) without thais
last term leads to values of T which are much too high and leads to
the 1ncorrect preaiction of an extensive miscibility gap in the

where AA is the specific bond free energy for formation of an A-X

When the next nearest neighbor interactions are not large
relative to nearest neighbor interactions, an spproximate correction
to equation (32) can be made simply by adding the Férland correction
terms which are the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and Sth terms on the right hand
side of equation (27).{23a)

This correction should not be adequate for cases in which the
next nearest neighbor interactions asre not small relative to the
nearest neighbor interaction terms. In effect, the fundamental
energy parameter AA in equation (33) should be concentration
dependent. From an examination of the model (as in Figure 2) one
cen deduce one possible ad hoc form for AA when |AA| is not very
large

Such an ad hoc concentration dependent energy term needs a closer
examination in order to use it in a manner which is consistent with
limiting forms which have better fundamental Jjustifications. When
non-random mixing is very ypronounced, one would have to substitute
for N B NX and NY in equation (35) to take into account the fact
that %he average ionlic environments are not characterized by these
ionic fractions. For example, N, would be substituted by Y, NX by
(l—I) and N, and N, by analogous but mcre complex expressions,

Such ad hoc correc%io s are consistent with observed deviations

from simple theory 2T) which have not been explained previously.

The quasi-lattice model has been applied to additive ternary
systems (A-B-C or AX-BX-CX).(15) The theory takes into account
interactions between A, B, and C. In the model for the system
A-B-C,energies are defined for the exchange of nearest neighbor

Each of these energies is related to thermodynamic parameters in
the binary systems and in real systems they can be evaluated from
measurements in the three binaries A-B, A-C, and B-C. 1In addition
to these three parameters a coordination number, Z, enters the
theory. The partial molar excess Ifree energy of component C,

EC’ for example, is given by the expression

E_Z o
G, == RT &n _%Q (39)

where o represents the fraction of the total number of nearest
neighbor palirs wbﬁch are C-C pairs. For random mixing this is
equal to N2 and G, = 0. If the C atoms attragt each other

o > N2 tHe numbér of pairs exceeds random G, > O and the com-
ponent € exhibits positive deviations from idéal solution behavior.
If C atoms repel each other on the average o < N2 and C exhibits
negative deviations from ideal behavior. To évaluate e one must

where a,, is the fraction of pairs which are i-j. Except for a few
simple iimiting forms, these non-linear equations must be solved
numerically. The influence of each pair interaction on thermodynamic
behavior can be investigated by the use of these eguations. Even
though real systems do not often conform tc the simple model used,
the equations are an important guide in a complete understanding

of multicomponent systems. As an illustration of this, in Figure 10,
we exhibit caleculations of phase diagrams from the theory for the
simple case in which the three salts have a melting point of 1000°C
and an entropy of fusion of 6 e.u. The energy parameters Ae,, are
related to deviations from ideality in the binary systems. %gr

where XX is Avogadros number, Consequently, calculations in the
ternary system can be made using information obtained from the
binary systems only. Figure 10a exhibits liquidus temperatures for
an ideal system. In Figures 10b-f a value of the cocordination
number Z = 10 has been used. Figure 10b exhibits the case in which

602
8ll three binaries exhibit negative deviations from idesl behsavior
(Ae/XT = 0.25). The liquidus isotherms for component C bow out

away from the C corner of the triangle. Figure 10c exhibits the

case 1n which all three binaries exhibit positive deviations from
1deal behavior and Ae/kT = -0.25 for all three. The 1sotherms for
component C bow towards the C corner of the triangle. The magni-
tudes of the howing in or out depend on the magnitudes of Ae. The
value of Ae C and Ac o influence the magnitude as is 1llustrated by
comparing F%gures 10%, 10d, and 10e which were calculated for

AEA /KT = Ae C/kT = +0.25, 0 and -0.25 respectively with Ae,_/kT =
+O.55. The Eow1ng out of the ligquidus isotherms for C means that

the quasi-binary C + AO B exhibits positive deviations from

1deal solution behav1or'?e9&%1ve to the two binaries AC and BC. This
phenomenon can be understood simply in the lamit of N, = 0 given 1in
equation (21) where for the cases such as in 10a, b, &, 4, and e
where ¢(N. ) 1s small, &n vy, 1s close to the linear sum oﬁ the wvalues
of &n v, In the AC and BC Binaries minus GC(AB), where G.(AB) for 10b,
104, ang 10e 1s negative and n v, has a maximum at X, =7"1/2. 1In
Figure 10f we exhibit a more realistic case in which Ae = 0,

bte, /KT = 0.25, Ae_. /KT = -0 25 so that AB 1s 1deal, AC exhibits
negative and BC positive deviations from ideal behavior. This case
parallels the behavior of real systems such ags LiF-NaF-KF,
NaF-KF-RbF, and LiF-NaF-RbF. By ccmparison of measured phase dia-
grams with such thecoretical calculations we can learn which parameters
and 1nteractions lead to particular features in the phase diagrams.
Thus, the shape of liquidus curves can tell us much about ionic
interactions and conversely, & knowledge of binary systems can be an
a1d 1n predicting phase behavior and other thermodynamic properties
in ternary systems.

It should be remembered that liquidus curves are isoactivity
curves, Thus, as an example, for cases in which AEA = Ag e if cne
varies the ratio of B to A at constant values of N ghe ac%1v1t1es
and activity coefficients go through a maximum 1f EE > 0 and the
AB binary exhibits negative deviations from ideal beﬁgv1or, and
they go through a minimum if Ae < 0 and the AB binary exhibits
positive deviations from i1deal behavior. These and the analogous
maxima and minima 1n reciprocal systems are important chemical
properties of ternary systems and exert a profound influence on
their chemistiry.

curve for a plot of RT &n v, vs. (1=N.)¢ which is similar to that in
reciprocal systems. The quantity G (AB) which is the total excess
free energy of mixing of a 50-50 mlxﬁgre of A and B, is defined in

Thus, theory leads to the prediction of miscikility gaps which are
completely enclosed within the ternary composition triangle.

Applications

In this section we will illustrate the application of some of the
principles discussed in previous sections. If we consider the solu-
bility product of AL,03 in a solvent as NaF calculated by the cycle
illustrated in equations (1)-(3), then for the reaction analogous to
that in equation (1)

606
A%,03 + 6NaF — 3Na,0 + 2ARF3

at 1200°K the free energy change is over 600 kcal. Consequently, one
would predict an extremely small solubility product for AL,03 in NaF.
Even with fairly negative values of the standard free energies of
solution corresponding to equations (2) and (3) and even with feas-
ible deviations from Henry's law, the predicted solubility for this
case is stil]l extremely low. However, polyvalent ions as At and
0 “in & uni-univalent salt should associate strongly in a manner
analogous to the equilibria (6), (7), and (8) so that

+3 = +

ALY+ 0 = A0 (50)
AT + 07 = Ag0j (51)
AR0Y + apt3 = pg,0te (52)
28207 = AL,0, 7, ete. (53)

with a tendency to produce species with low charge density (e.g.
(50), 51), and (53)). From an electrostatic point of view when
the A% 3 concentration is not high species of low charge density
are energetically more favorable than igecies of high charge
density which contain more than one Af icn.

In s%%v?r halide systems in molten alkali nitrates, it is well
xnown(3) (4 that with the addition of a common ion (either silver
or halide ions) to an alkali nitrate the solubility of the silver
halide first decreases to a minimum and then increases with further
additions. This phenomenon results largely from the association
equilibria involving spe¢ies of stoichiometry different from the
silver halide (e.g. Ag,X or AgXE) which have a net charge.
Analogously, for Af,03, the addition of ARFj3 or Naj;0 to the solvent
NaF, if large enough, should sclubilize Af,03. For ALF3 additions
in this reciprocal system the important species involved in solu~
bilization should have a ratio of A2/0 which, (on the average) is
greater than 2/3 (e.g. species as A%0 , A%,0, , etc., are present).
The temperature dependence of equilibria involving these species

is predictable from equations as (9). The temperature dependence
is probably very large so that theory may help in defining ad-
vantageous conditions for solubilization. At high concentrations
of A%F3 (> 15 mole %) in NaF the formation of more highly charged
species containing more than one A%L*3 ion as A2,0%" becomes less
unfavorable because the high average charge density of caticns (due
to the high concentration of A2*3 ions) will stabilize species of
high charge density.

In a similar manner, association equilibris of constituents in
dilute solution in molten irocn alloys are important in deoxidation

607
and desulfurization reacticns and the temperature dependence
describted by equations as (9) and (15) aid in predicting the
temperature dependence of the equilibrium quotients for these
reactions if the parameters AAi are temperature independent.

One potential application which has not been utilized in a
practical manner is the utiliza?ig? of immiscible salt pairs for
extraction equilibria., Kennedy 29) has published en academic il-
lustration of this. He has measured the distribution of T2 ion
between two immiscible salts KNO3-AgBr. He defined a measured
distribution coefficient KO where

K, = Np,+(KNO3) /N, 4(AgBr) (54)

and an association constant K; for the association equilibrium
in KNOj3

% + Br~ = T2Br (55)
N
T
Ky = ﬁ_&@%_:_ (56)

and a "true" distribution coefficient, K, is defined as

Noepy (K¥03)

K = NTQ+(AgBr) (57)

+
such that in the hypothetical case in which all T# ions in KINOj
existed as T&Br then K = K. If the concentration range is such
that TL ions exist as T+ or TeBr species in solution in KNOj3 then

K
K =K+
o] KINB;

(58)

Thus from measured values of K, at various concentrations of free
bromide ions one can evaluate K; for the equilibrium (55). 1In

the presence of Ag+ ions N_- could be calculated from the total
bromide concentration and a knowledge of the asscciation of bromide
with silver. Figure 11 exhibits a plot of K, versus 1/N . ot five
temperatures ranging from 450-550°C. The distribution coefficients
are strong functions of the complexing anion concentration. Values
of K; for the equilibrium (55) were evaluated from the ratio of the
intercept to the slope of the curves in Figure 11. Values of K

in mole fraction units ranged from 26 at 450°C to 19 at 550°C. The
temperature coefficients of K; (and of the slopes)are consistent with
the predictions from equation (9) for a constant value of AA; and

the theory can aid in predicting the temperature dependence of K .,
The ratio K/K; in equation (58) can be calculated from a cycle
similar to the FFG cycle (equilibria (1), (2), and (3))

TeCa(in AgCL) + KNO3(liquid)-— TANO3(liguid) + KC2 (59)
TRNO3(1iquid)—o TANO3(~ dilution in KNOj3) (60)
KC%— KC2 (= dilution in KNO3) (61)

One can calculate AG?T if one knows the activity coefficients of
TeCr in AgCl as well gs the standard free energies formation of all
the components. The ratio (K/K;) is then given by

AG?S + Ang + AG?? = -RT 4n(K/K;) (62)

Immiscible sal Byases for extraction equilibrias have been
utilized by Moore 2 for equilibria of potentially practical
interest in the additive ternary system LiC2-KC2-A%C23. He
meagured distribution ccefficients between the two immiscible phases
LiC% and KCf-AfCL3 where the immiscibility is related to the very
negative value of the excess free energy of mixing of the KCi-ARCLj
system which corresponds to the system A-B in Hagemark's theory.

From an examination of Hagemark's equations we may raticnalize the
relative values of . Qualitatively, values of > 1 mean that
the salt reacts more strongly with ALC23; or KCZ than these two

react with each other. Values of %8 < 1 generally mean a relatively
weak interaction of the salt with KC& or ALCRl3. This information
can be guessed from a knowledge of the binary systems. The inter-
actions with LiCR phase, which are not large for these cases needs
to be taken into account too. Other additive ternary and reciprocal
systems with similar miscibility gaps should exhibit separations
which are potentially useful.

Another sapplication of these principles by Morrey and Moore(BO)
was in the extraction of UCL; by molten AL in the binary system
KC2-A%CR3. From an examination of equation (21) where the binary
system KC2&-ALCL3 corresponds to the A-B binary we see that the
very negative excess free energy of mixing of KC&-ALCZ; will con-
tribute to a maximum in the activity coefficients for a component
C as UCL3. UCR3 interacts weakly with KC2 and 1f it also inter=
acts weakly with or has a positive free energy of solution in
AfCL3 then there should be a maximum in the activity coefficients
of UCZ3 in this system as a function of the composition of the
KCe-A2CL3 solvent. The maximum will tend to be at compositions
where G has a minimum, e.g. at about 50-50 mole % for KCR-ALCLj3.
Such a maximum will lead to & maximum in the extraction cceffi-
clents as was observed by Morrey and Moore. Similarly, maxima
in vy, should prcduce minima in solubility which, for example,
have been observed for PuFj3 in the LiF-BeF, and NaF-BeF,
binaries at composit%oni which probably are close to minima in
G for the binaries.'3!

The activities of "Fe0" in the steelmaking system Fe0-Ca0-S8i0,
is consistent with the expectations from Hagemark's calculstions
(which apply only to simpler systems). Taylor and Chipman(32)
have measured the activities of Fe0 in this system and these are
plotted for the guasi-binary system Fe0-Ca,;S510, in Figure 12.

If we calpulate Ln y, o from equation (48) by the ad hoc replace-
ment of (G,-G (AB)) by Ye free energy of formation of 3 Ca,Si0,
(which is approximately equal to the excess free energy of
mixing per two equivalents) and of the mole fractions by equi-
valent fractions we obtain the sclid "S" shaped curve in Figure
12 which correspoends well with the measurements. Even without a
Justification of this ad hoc calculation it is clear that the "S"
shaped character of the curve is related to clustering of Fe 2
with 0”2 ions. This association leads to a concentration de-
pendence cof the activities o; FeQ and a phase behavior similar to
that found for LiF in the Li , K ||F ,C¢ system.

Fundamental concepts can provide considerable insight into the
chemistry of multicomponent systems. Although theories are some-
times approximate cor apply only to simple systems, they neverthe-
less provide a basis for guessing the important parameters and
variables necessary for choosing and optimizing pyrometellurgical
processes.,

Abstract

The chemical development which has been carried out, largely at
Oak Ridge National Laboratory, in support of the Molten Salt Breeder
Reactor (MSBR) concept has produced a fairly quantitative description
of the chemistry and thermodynamics of actinide, fission-product
and structural metal fluorides in molten LiF-BeF, solutions. This
information is summarized here (1) in terms of important hetero-
geneous chemical equilibria, many of which have been measured direct-
ly; (2) in terms of free energies of formation of solutes in molten
0.67 LiF-0.33 BeF, solutions; and {(3) in terms of standard electrode
potentials, some of which have been measured directly. This informa-
tion may be applied to a variety of important aspects of molten salt
reactor chemistry: The extent of corrosion reactions between the
container material -~- a nickel base alloy (Hastelloy N) containing
Fe, Cr, and Mo -- and the fuel can be specified from hydrogen
reduction equilibria. Salt purification procedures can be specified
for the removal of structural metal cations, oxides, and sulfides
from a knowledge of the hydrofluorination equilibria which are
employed. The stability of Th, Pa, and U fluorides toward chemical
reduction and toward precipitation a® oxide similarly have been
established by measurements of heterogeneous equilibria which include
oxide solubility and oxide exchange reactions. The behavior of a
large part of the yield of fission products can also be predicted
on the basis of these studies and available thermochemical data.
Finally, the chemical studies which are reviewed here and the thermo-
dynamic information which they have produced suggest the importance
of the redox potential, determined by the extent of reduction of UF,
to UF3 in the fuel, in controlling many features of MSBR fuel chemistry.

Introduction

The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) has been operating
successfully at ORNL since mid 1965. It is a reactor which is
fueled by a molten mixture of .65 LiF-.29 BeF, -.05 ZrF, containing
<0.01 mole fraction of fissile UF,, first as uranium-235 and more
recently as uranium-233. It is moderated by graphite and contained
in a nickel-base alloy (Hastelloy N) developed at ORNL for this
reactor concept. The principal objective of the MSRE has been to
demonstrate the compatibility of this combination of materials in
a molten salt breeder reactor (MSBR) as a means to achieve breeding
of 233U from 232Th with thermal neutrons(1-3). A molten salt breeder
is, perhaps more than any other, a chemist's reactor; the fuel is
dissolved and circulated in a relatively unique coolant, the 233pa
which is bred must be removed scon after it is formed to avoid the
loss of a significant fraction by neutron capture, and finally the
fission products produced during operation can be removed con-
tinuously to improve the neutron economy.

Extensive chemical development therefore preceded the design and
construction of the MSRE to establish the means and the extent of
materials purification required, the chemical stability and cor-
rosiveness of the fuel, the chemistry of uranium therein, and the
radiation stability of the fuel. Continuing studies during the
operation of the MSRE have given increased attention to the
chemistry of the fission products and the means for their removal,
and to a method for removing 233Pa on a short cycle. Attention is
also being given to methods of on-stream control of fuel chemistry.
These extensive studies have been reviewed recently by Grimes(4’5§.

In a previous review,(6) I have summarized the equilibrium
measurements, and some emf measurements, which had been carried out
in LiF-BeF, melts, mostly near the composition 0.67 LiF-0.33 BeF,,
as part of this chemical development program. These were combined
with available thermodynamic data to provide a list of formation-
free energies and electrode potentials in 0.67 LiF-0.33 BeF,.

Observed effects of melt composition on solute activity coefficients
were also reviewed. Since then, enough new information has appeared
to permit a considerable extension and some revision of this com-
pilation. This is presented here in much the same form as previously.

The purpose of the present review, as previously, is to extend
the usefulness of the chemical studies which have been carried out
in support of the MSBR program by the systematic application of the
methods of equilibrium thermodynamics. This seems especially
appropriate and should be especially rewarding here since in molten
fluoride systems reaction rates are expected to be relatively high
with equilibrium conditions thereby often closely approached.

Reactions in 0,67 LiF-0,33 BeF,

Table I summarijizes the reactions for which values of the equilib-
rium constants are known from direct measurements, or from a com-—
bination of other measured equilibria and/or thermodynamic data.

In these reactions, and elsewhere, the following notation is used
to denote the various states: (c), crystalline solid; (g), gas;
(d), dissolved at low concentration in 0.67 LiF-0.33 BeF,; (ss),
solid solution.

In the majority of reactions, F is the only anion involved and
for simplicity the dissolved reactants and products are written in
the molecular form, though this is not intended to imply the actual
species present in sclution. When anions other than F appear in
the reactions, lonic species are written. In some cases this is
done to avoid the choice of a molecular «component in solution and
in others it is done to indicate that complete dissceiation of amn
anion (e.g., 027) and a cation (e.g., Zr"T) is assumed.

The concentration scale is the mole fraction; e.g.,

r, = Pwr,/ wp, * OLiv t Pger,’

Gas pressures are expressed in atmospheres, and, at the low pressures
and high temperatures involved, gases are assumed ideal. The stand-
ard states for the reactants and products generally can be seen from
the form of the equilibrium constant. Here, and elsewhere, the
standard state for most solutes is the hypothetical one meole fraction
ideal solution in 0.67 LiF-0.33 BeF,. Exceptions are LiF, BeF;,
Be2+, i7", and F~. For these major components the solvent composi-
tion is taken as the standard state; i.e., aLiF’ aBeFQ’ aBe2+’ aLi+

and a_- all are unity in 0.67 LiF-0.33 BeF,. The values of K in
Table I strictly apply only to solutions in the solvent 0.67 LiF-
0.33 BeF, which are sufficiently dilute that Henry's law may be
assumed. The effect of changing salt composition and increasing solu-
te concentrations will be considered presently.

The expression given for the numerical value of the equilibrium
constant

log K = a + b(103/T)

while adequate for evaluating K as a function of T for most purposes,
generally should not be taken as a reliable measure of the heat of
reaction (AH = -2.3 R(b)) or the entropy of reaction (AS = 2.3 R(a))
since, over the narrow temperature range where a and b usually were
determined, there can be large compensating errors in these constants.

From the equilibrium data in Table I and from the literature
sources indicated, free energies of formation have been compiled for

An alternative, and very useful means of summarizing the avail-
able information has proven to be electrode potentials for half cell
reactions. These, listed in Table IV, are referred to the half-
cell reaction

(429) HF(g) + e - F (d) + 1/2 Hy(g), E° =0

Thus the potential for each half-cell reaction in Table IV corre-
sponds to AG (= - nFE°) for the complete reaction obtained by com-
bining the given half-cell reaction with half-cell reaction 429 above.
(In the text the various reactions, and AGY, AGE, and E° values all
will be referred to by numbers which identify the entries in the
various tables.) As usual, if two half-cell reactions are combined
to give a complete reaction, their potentials are simply combined
algebraically to give E° (and hence AG°) for the complete reactions.
If, instead, two half-cell reactions are combined to give a third
half-cell reaction, the volt-equivalents (nE°) must be combined
algebraically to obtain the volt-equivalents of the third half-cell
reaction.

Activity Coefficients

In several of the investigations cited in Table I, the effect
of melt composition on the equilibrium under study.was determined.
The observed effects are presented in Fig. 1 as activity coef-
ficient curves, For solutes the activity coefficients are unity at
the reference composition; for the solvent components at this com-
position they are vy F = 1.5 and YBeF, - 3. The various curves
were derived as follows: 2

LiF,BeF;. The activity coefficients of these components were
recently re-determined by Hitch and Baes(7), using the cell
Be|LiF, BeF,|H,, HF,Pt
for which the cell reaction was taken to be
Be(c) + 2HF(g) - BeF,(d) + Hy(g)
(The potentials observed at 0.33 BeF, in this cell gave directly the
E° values for the Bett/Be couple (407, Table 1V),

CeF3,PuF3. These curves are based on the observed variation of
the solubility of the tri-fluorides with melt composition reported
by Ward et al{8) and by Barton(9),

NiF,. This curve is an estimate based on the observations that
the solubility of NiF, varies less with composition in NaF-ZrF,
melts than does the solubility of CeFj.

The activity coefficients curves in Fig. 1 have been used in a

few instances to make small corrections in measurements reported at

salt compositions other than 0.67 LiF-0.33 BeF,. It is evident from

the figure that activity coefficients generally do not show large

variations and hence these corrections were small. It has been noted

previously(6) that the Yyp Curves (Fig. 1) fall between the curves

for 0.67 YLiF and 0,33 YBe?z' Thelr location within the envelope
defined by these two curves, except for Yyp* depends upon the ratio

of charge to radius (z/r) for the cation M2+. As yet, insufficilent
data are available to decide whether some analogous correlation
exists in MSBR fuel solvents where ThF, as well as LiF and BeF; is
present as a major component. Studies such as the recent solubility
measurements of Barton et al(l3), however, should soon improve our
knowledge of medium effects in such three-component solvents.

Hydrofluorination and Oxide Chemistry

Oxide is a commonly occcurring impurity which enters LiF-BeF;
melts by reactions of water vapor to form OH  and 02~ (the reverse
of 102 and 103) or by the dissolution of structural metal oxides.
Since BeO, ThO;, U0, and certain other oxides are sparingly soluble
in LiF~BeF, melts, the chemistry of oxide and its removal has been

629
of considerable interest.

Oxide is removed from these melts by treatment with an HF-Hj;
mixture which reverses the hydrolysis reaction and evolves water
vapor. The equilibria involved (102-109) have been studied b{
Mathews and Baes(14) ip LiF-BeF, melts and by Hitch and Baes (15)
in LiF-BeF,-ZrF, melts. The results show that the removal of oxide
by hydrofluorination can be made quantitative 16), Indeed, this
treatment was used to determine oxide, as evolved water, in measure-
ments of the solubility of BeO and Zr02(15). More recently it has
been used in a method developed by Apple g£'§£(17) for the remote
determination of oxide (typically 60 ppm) in MSRE fuel samples.

The formation of OH during hydrofluorination impedes the removal
of oxide and, moreover, if this hydroxide is incompletely removed
during the treatment, it will subsequently decompose slowly to
produce 02~ and HF (104) or H,0 (105). Thus hydroxide is an
oxidizing impurity (423). Since HF is not very soluble in LiF-BeF,
melts (101), the presence of OH™ in small amounts after hydrofluorina-
tion is easily detected by sparging with a dry inert gas to deter-
mine if more HF is evolved than would be expected from dissolved HF
alone.

Hydrofluorination of Sulfide and Iodide

Hydrofluorination as a purification treatment also removes
sulfide which can arise from the reduction of any sulfate impurities
present in the raw materials. Its removal is important because of
the sensitivity of nickel and nickel-base alloys, used for con-
tainment, to sulfide embrittlement. Only the lower limit of the
equilibrium constant for the formation of H,S (113) could be deter-
mined by Stone and Baes in their measurements because of reaction
of Hy;S with the container after it was evolved from the melt.

Preliminary measurements have been made by Freasier.gg_gl(lg) of
the conversion of I~ to HI by HF (114). The results show that
iodide is the stable state of iodine under mildly reducing conditionms,
and that it is removed by hydrofluorination. This information is
useful in predicting the behavior of fission product iodine in a
reactor fuel. 1In addition, it suggests a possible method of
removing 6.7 hr 1351 from the fuel before large fractions decay to
135Xe, the most significant neutron poison of all the fission
products.

Structural and Noble Metals

The hydrogen which accompanies and follows hydrofluorination in
the usual purification treatment reduces a number of metal fluoride
impurities. The reduction equilibria in the case of the fluorides
CrF, (115), FeF, (117), and NiF, (121) have been studied carefully
by Blood(zo), who found them to be increasingly easy to reduce in

630
that order.

As a result of its nobility in MSR fluorides, nickel is widely
used for their containment. The alloy used for the MSRE is a
nickel-base alloy containing 7% Cr, 5% Fe and 167% Mo (Hastelloy N)
which is very nearly inert to the fuel salt under normal reactor
conditions. This is not because of favorable corrosion kinetics
or because of a protective film of corrosion products, but simply
because, in the absence of oxidizing impurities, there are no
thermodynamically favored chemical reactions (Fig. 2); i.e., the
container metal is essentially at equilibrium with the fuel salt.

Blood also measured the solubilities of FeF, (118) and NiF, (122),
which are only sparingly soluble in LiF-BeF,; melts. In addition,
it may be calculated (119, 123) from the previously cited reactions
and available thermochemical data (21} that FeO and NiO, when present
as saturating solids, give still lower concentrations of Fet* and
Nt Thus at equilibrium with both Fe0® and Be0, 0,67 LiF-0.33 BeF,
should contain ~1.5 m/o FeF, at 600°C (120); at equilibrium with NiO
and Be0 it should contain 0,007 m/o NiF, (124).

Analogous calculations suggest that Cr;03 is in a sense also an
Yinsoluble" oxide since its hydrofluorination and reduction to CrF,
should not occur readily (116). Thus, at equilibrium with 0.1 atm
HF, 1 atm H,, and Cr,03(c), the melt should contain an amount of
CrF, at 600°C given by

for which the cell reaction

MoF3(d) + 3/2 Ni(c) =~ Mo(e) + 3/2 NiF,(e)

was assumed, suggest that MoF; lies between FeF, and NiF; in ease
of reduction. MoO, should be another "“imsoluble' or resistant
oxide, since its reduction to the metal by hydrogen (126) is, in
effect, more difficult than the reduction of dissolved MoFj.

In the absence of sufficient knowledge about the identity and
stability of lower fluorides of niobium, tantalum, ruthenium, or
tungsten, estimates of the minimum reactivity of these metals were
obtained from available thermochemical data for NbF5(23), TaF5(24),
RuFg 25) and WFg 26), Half cell reactions involving these metals,
and chromium, iron, and nickel are listed in Table 1IV. The fol-

The relative nobility of nickel and the surprising reactivity of

Reactions of $iC;

Molten fluorides are widely considered difficult to contain with-
out corrosion of, or contamination by, the container. This unsavory
reputation probably results from the tendency of fluorides to attack
glass and silica, thus preventing the study of fluorides with the
ease and convenience afforded by these materials. As we have seen,
this reputation is undeserved in the case of LiF-BeF, melts, which
are readily contained in metals under mildly reducing conditions.
Furthermore, it may be predicted from the previously described
studies of the hydroflucrination of oxide and from AGE for S10,
and SiF, that the reaction with 5i0, to produce SiF, (128) is quite
limited. This has been confirmed by Bamberger et al(27,28) who
found that if the SiF, is confined within the system, or if it is
introduced with the cover gas, then vitreous Si0, is essentially
non—contaminating and quite durable, save for crystallization, at
temperatures to 700°C.

If the SiF, produced by reaction 128 is swept away, its pressure
falls and the oxide ion concentration increases in the melt until
are fixed (131) by the precipitation of a new

solid phase, Be,SiOy.
Actindides

At a few mole percent of ThF, in 0.67 LiF-0.33 BeF, (the exact
amount being uncertain because of unknown activity coefficient
effects) ThO, becomes the least soluble oxide., U0, is considerably
less soluble and becomes the least soluble oxide at <0.1 m/fo (134).

Zr0; replaces U0, as the least soluble oxide phase when the XZrFu/

XUFI+ ratio exceeds a value in the range 1.5-6, depending on tem-

(29)

perature (135) and ZrF, concentration . Hence ZrF, was added

to the MSRE as an oxide getter to prevent the precipitation of UO,
in the reactor. Romberger et al, found that Zr0O, does not dissolve
significant amounts of UDZ(§U).

Since ThO, and U0, form a continuous serles of solid solutions,
Bamberger et_gk(ll) were led to study the exchange equilibrium of
Th** and U"T between (U-Th)0, solid solutions and an LiF~BeF, melt
containing UF, and ThF, (136). ©UO, is considerably less soluble
than ThO, in the fluoride phase and so U** strongly distributes to
the oxide solid-solution phase. The results of this study have

633
permitted an improved estimate of Aaf for ThF,(d), as indicated
in Table III (308).

Measurements of the reduction and extraction of protactinium
into molten bismuth by Ross et al(31) provides strong evidence
that protactinium is present as PaF, in LiF-BeF, melts under
reducing conditions. While as yet there are insufficient data to
estimate quantitatively its stability, PaF, is more easily reduced
into bismuth than is ThF, and less easily reduced than UF3, hence
we may estimate

Aéf(Pan(d)) nv ~412 kcal/mole (1000°K)
Early measurements by Shaffer et qi_(32) showed that protactinium

is precipitated from molten fluorides by oxides. The oxide of pro-
tactinium which is precipitated has not been determined as yet.

Long and Blankenship(lo) studied the partial reduction of UF, to
UF3 by hydrogen, both in the solids and in molten fluorides (137).
In an MSR fuel, as we shall see, the U“Y/U3t redox couple can be
used as a redox buffer and indicator to establish and control the
redox potential., From the measurements of Jennings et a1(3 ) the
solubility of UF3 is quite limited in 0.67 LiF-0.33 Ber, being
only 0.2 m/o at 600°C (138).

Barton(9) has measured the solubility of the sparingly soluble
PuF3 (140), and it appears that this is the stable form of plutonium
under mildly reducing conditions. From these results, and available
thermochemical estimates for PuFj(c) and Pu,03 34) , we may estimate,
though with considerable uncertainty, the solubility of Pu;03(140).

Lanthanides

As indicated by the estimates of AGf for LaF3(c), CeF3(c), NdFz(c),
and SmF3(c) (Table II, 220-~223) the trivalent lanthanides are among
the most stable of fluorides. These values are based on recent
measurements of AHf from fluorine bomb calorimetry and other estimated
AHE values, all by Rudzitis and VanDeventer(35) and on ASf values
from the reported ASf values for CeF3(24) and the lanthanide
oxides(35) and the assumption that the difference [ASf(LnF3) -

% ASf(anoa)] is a constant for all the lanthanides.

Since the limited solubilities of these fluorides have been
measured by Ward et al 8) and Doss et al( 6) the AGE values can
also be calculated (302-305, Table III). The resulting E° values
place the Ln? */Ln couples second only to Li*/Li in reducing power
(402-405, Table 1IV).

634
MSRE Fuel Chemistry

The chemistry of a single fluid MSBR fuel salt, which should
approximate the composition ©.72 LiF-0,16 BeF,-0.12 ThF¥,, probably
will not differ greatly from the chemistry of the melts described
above, provided that large departures from equilibrium conditions
are not produced by the radiation fluxes of an operating reactor,

Effect of Redox Potential

A large fraction of the chemical reactions which have been
described are redox reactions, as is attested by the list of half-
cell reactions in Table IV. The degree of oxidation ¢f each of
these couples when present in a fuel salt at equilibrium is deter-
mined by the overall state of oxidation of the system, or, more
briefly, by the redox potential.

The most convenient measure of the redox potential is the ratio
XUF /XUF in the fuel, since this couple can act as a buffer; i.e.,
b 3

with a significant fraction of both UF, and UF3 present, the amount
of each can considerably exceed the amount of any other oxidizable
or reduceable substance in the system. Thus any condition which
might otherwise alter considerably the amounts of these other oxi-
dizable or reduceable substances will instead merely change slightly
the ratio of UF, to UFj3, and so only slightly change the redox
potential.

In Fig. 2, wherein the concentrations of the structural metal
ions Cr2+, Fe2+, Mo3+, and Ni?t are plotted as a function of the
UF,/UFy ratio, we see that when the amount of reduced uranium
exceeds 17 of the total uranium, this buffer effect appears. The
oxidized metals all become rapidly insignificant in concentration
compared to the increasing UF; concentration. Not only is corrosion
of the container alloy thus arrested completely, but any oxidant
that enters the system will oxidize the UF; rather than the container.

Two curves are shown for each metal-ion reaction, indicating the
equilibrium of the metal ion with the pure metal (dashed lines) or
with Hastelloy N (solid lines). The latter has been assumed to be
an ideal metal solution. The assumption that such an alloy phase
exists at equilibrium witn the fuel is no doubt a better approxi-
mation of the situation in a reactor than is the assumption of the
separate pure metal phases, In either case, the conclusion to be
drawn is essentially the same, namely, that with more than 1%
reduction of the UF, to UF3 in the fuel, there should be no signifi-
cant corrosicen. Four years of operating experience with the MSRE
supports this conclusion.

It is probable that in MSBR fuels, with a few tenths of a mole

% total uranium present, the UF,/UF3 ratio will be maintained in
the range 10-100, the upper limit being set by the oxidation of

635
container-chromium and the lower limit being set by the approach to
UF3 saturation.

Included in Fig. 2 is a curve representing the distribution, as
a unitless concentration ratio, of (fission-product) iodine between
the fuel salt and a gas phase. It is seen that the iodine should
be present as I in the fuel salt under normal reducing conditioms.
Indeed relatively strong oxidizing conditions (XUFH/XUF3 >108) are

necessary to produce significant amounts of iodine in the gas phase.

Figure 3 indicates the conditions under which the noble-metal
fission products should appear in their upper, volatile oxidation
states. While these elements may be at a high state of oxidation
during the instant after thelr birth, at equilibrium in a system
with a normal UF,/UF; ratio, the only such volatile fission product
we have any reason to expect is NbFg, and this should not be
detected in the off-gas system until the UF,/UF3 ratio exceeds 10“.
The volatile fluorides MoFg and PuFs should not appear until the
system is so oxidizing that C¥, in one case, or UFg in the other,
also appears. Included in Fig. 3 are curves for TaFg and WFg which
are not fission products.

Operating experience with the MSRE has shown that niobium
activity, while not found in the fuel under normally reducing con-
ditions, does appear in solution under more oxidizing conditions.
While the UF,/UF3 ratio at which this appearance of niobium in
solution occurs is not yet accurately known, its behavior is con-
sistent with the calculated curve for NbFg in Fig. 3. Alternatively,
a soluble lower valence state of nlobium may be involved 37), 1n
any case, it seems possible that fission product niobium will serve
as a useful redox indicator.

Anomalous Behavicr of Noble Metal Fission Products

In the MSRE, the noble-metal fission products just discussed --
Nb, Mo, and Ru -~ have been found to behave in a curious and
intriguing fashion(4), Large fractions of the expected yield of
these activities have been found to concentrate in the region of
the salt-gas interface in the pump bowl. When this was first
observed, there was considerable temptation to speculate that these
metals concentrated there because they were oxidized to their upper-
valent, volatile fluorides. But as can be seen from Fig. 3 and
Table IV, except for NbFg, they are themselves strong oxidizing
agents which should be reduced quickly by the UF3 in the fuel or
by the container metal.

Rather, at the present writing, it appears far more likely that
the mechanism of this concentration effect involves finely divided
metallic particles of these fission products which are trapped at
the salt-gas interface because they are not wetted by the salt.

Variation of Partial Pressure of Volatile Fluorides as a Function

CONCENTRATION RATIO
Since it is necessary to sparge an MSBR fuel salt vigorously with
an inert gas to remove 135Xe, it will be important to determine if
and how efficiently these noble metal fission products can be swept
away at the same time.

Hydrogen Couples

Figure 4 indicates the behavior of a number of redox couples
which involve hydrogen. While it is unlikely that a reactor would
be operated under a hydrogen atmosphere, no doubt there has been
appreciable amounts of hydrogen in the MSRE from the decomposition
of traces of lubricant o0il which entered the high temperature region
of the circulating pump. More important, in an MSBR it is possible
that an HF-H, gas treatment will be desirable at some point to
control the UF,/UFj3 ratio, or to remove oxide or iodide. With the
conditions as specified in Fig. 4 (1 atm hydrogen at 600°C) we see
that all the couples shown are reduced under a wide range of the
UF,/UF3 ratio, with the reduced species being in the fuel salt.
Then, if hydrofluorination is to be used as a means of removing
oxide or iodide, it must be done under conditions which are more
oxidizing than normal. Hence such a treatment should be followed
by re-reduction of the fuel salt., If hydrogen is allowed to reach
the graphite moderator, some hydrocarbons may be formed.

and Kr are known to be quite insoluble in molten fluorides(38). The
Groups VII, I, II, III and IV fission products should be dissolved
in the fuel salt in their normal valences. The remainder —- of
which Nb, Mo, Tc and Ru are the Important contributors -- are
expected to be reduced to the metallic state under the reducing
conditions which would normally be maintained in a reactor.

Also indicated in Table V are values of the product of the
fission yield(39) and the valence of each fission product. This
serves to show that with reducing conditions maintained and rapid
removal of Xe and Kr, the sum of the charges on all the fission
products is less than the +4 per mole of uranium burned, being nearly
+3. Hence as burnup of the uranium fuel (mostly UF,) proceeds, UF;
or other reducing agent must be added to maintain reducing conditions.
Otherwise, the deficiency of cation equivalents will be made up by
the oxidation of UF; present and then by corrosion of the container;
i.e., the fission process is oxidizing.

Conclusion

It is fair to say, I think, that as a result of the supporting
chemical studies which have accompanied the development of the
Molten Salt Breeder Reactor concept, a sound understanding of the
chemistry of such molten fluoride fueled reactors has been achieved.
The most significant conclusion to be drawn is that such a reactor
system -- with partially reduced UF, in an LiF-BeF,-ThF, solvent,
contained in Hastelloy N, and moderated by graphite -- is a
chemically stable system which is essentially at equilibrium and
free of corrosion. Further, the equilibrium chemical behavior of
the important fission products is reasonably predictable. The
current successful operation of the MSRE supports these conclusions.

Abstract

The composition of the gas phase resulting from a
high temperature chlorination of uranium-=thorium fuels
was computed for different process conditions. From
these values the theoretical uranium and protactinium
losses caused by a codeposition of thorium and uranium
or protactinium chlorides, respectively, were calcu-
lated. The results have shown, that tolerable uranium
losses can be achieved, if the partial pressure of
uranium is very low or the deposited thorium chloride
is purified by a sublimation procedure,

Introduction

The High Temperature Gas Cooled Thorium Reactors
of AVR and THTR type operate with graphite balls con-
taining thorium uranium oxide or carbide particles,
coated with pyrocarbon and silicon carbide. The uranium
content of the fuel elements is relatively low. A typi-
cal sphere which weighs nearly 200 g contains only 10
to 20 g of particles in which the uranium thorium ratio
is approximately 1:25, corresponding to a uranium con-
tent of less than o.5% related to the full sphere. The
protactinium content varies with the conditions of
reactor operation. One calculation has given a wvalue
of 31 mg Pa per sphere.

For the reprocessing of these fuel elements we are
developing a combined chlorination solvent extraction
process, the so~called CHLOREX process (1). The balls
are broken and ground to a particle size of less than
300 um with a small portion of fines below 50 um. The
material is then fed into a fluidized bed and heated
to 1000 or 1100°C. In the presence of graphite the
heavy metal oxides are converted to the volatile chlo~
rides by chlorine. Also most of the fission products
are volatilized under these conditions. The chlorides
are deposited in a condenser, dissolved in 2 M hydro-
chloric acid and purified by solvent extraction with
long chain aliphatic amines or, after conversion of
the chlorides to the nitrates, with tributyl phosphate.
The resulting solution may be used for the refabrica-
tion of new particles by the sol gel technique.

At the present state of development we do not in-
sist on a separation of the chlorides by fractional
condensation, because the isclation and purification
of protactinium and uranium is easily carried out by
aqueous process steps. However, in the future we will
try to achieve separation by condensation of thoriur
chloride at 500 to 600°C and uranium and protactin a
chlorides at room temperature, In this case the thordum
fraction may be easily converted to a storable form
and discarded to the waste, But it is essential that
thorium chloride be deposited nearly uranium free.

The first inspection of the vapour pressure curves
(fig.1) shows that the volatilities of thorium chlori e,
uranium pentachloride and hexachloride are very diffe-
rent, so that one should expect a good separation. Some
laboratory experiments have given encouraging results,
but in other runs the uranium content of the thorium
chloride was too high. Therefore we have calculated

the gas phase equilibria between the most important
components carbon monoxide, chlorine, carbon oxychlo-
ride, thorium chloride, uranium tetrachloride, uranium
pentachloride, and uranium hexachloride and the cor-
responding activities of uranium in the condensed
thorium chloride. From these values we have calculated
the theoretical uranium losses under different process
conditions.

The results of these calculations may deviate from experimental
data to a greater or lesser degree, because we must estimate some
of the thermodynamic data, However, the variation of some param-
eters shows the influence of the different operating conditions,
Finally the results have suggested requirements for the construce
tion of the condenser,

Fundamentals

The chlorination of thorium oxide in the presence
of carbon at high temperature is given by the equation
Tho + 2 C + 2 Cl1l gy ThC1 + 2 CO 1
2(s) (s) 2(g) 4 (g) (g) ()
The chlorination of carbides can be described by

ThCz(s) + 2 012(g) — ThClh(g) + 2 c(s) (2)

Under the same conditions uranium forms the three chlorides UCl),,
UClg, and UClg; protactinium forms PaClgsy the fission products
form their respective chlorides; and silicon carbide forms sili-
con tetrachloride., The main gas phase components are connected
by the following equilibria:

CO + Cl,e=3 COCl, (3)

UCLy () *+ 1/2 Clg==2 UCl (&)
PR

UCL,(g) + Clp &= UCl (5)

These equilibria are all determined by the chlorine
potential.

Moreover, the vapourization equilibria of ThClh,
UClu, UCl5 and UCl6 must be considered.

The thermodynamic data used for the calculation of
the equilibria are given in table 1. (2).

If the gas phase, containing the reaction products

and an excess of chlorine, is cooled from the high re-
action temperature, thorium chloride, and at lower tem-
perature uranium chlorides will condense. However the
separation of thorium and uranium chlorides cannot be
quantitative, if one or more uranium species are soluble
in the thorium chloride. In this case the thermodynamic
activity of the uranium chloride in the thorium chlo-
ride is given by the equation

P
ay = g (7)
%y |

Py= partial pressure of the respective uranium species
in the system

o .
P ;=vapour pressure of the respective pure uranium
species.

That means, that uranium is deposited together with
thorium chloride even if the partial pressure in the
gas phase is much lower than the vapour pressure of
the pure uranium compound.

650
Since UCl, and ThCl, have the same crystal structure
and similar "lattice parameters (4), UCl, is soluble in
ThCl, . The solid solution should nearly approximate
the 'ideal case and that means that the activity co-
efficient should be approximately unity and RAOULT's
law can be assumed to be valid in the whole range of
concentration. On this basis equation 7 changes to

PUCla
XUClu = o (8)
ucl,
XUClh= mole fraction of UClu in ThClh

This enables one to calculate the amount of uranium tetrachloride
in the thorium chloride,

There is nothing known as to the solubility of ura-
nium pentachloride and hexachloride in thorium chloride.
The hexachloride, however, can be ruled out because the
activity in the thorium chloride would be so low that
it would not make an appreciable contribution to the
uranium content in the thorium chloride matrix., However,
the solubility of uranium pentachloride in thorium chlo-
ride cannot be excluded. Indeed, the pentachloride could
not be found in deposited uranium tetrachloride (5),
however it is known that some solubility usually occurs
even if the crystal structure of the soclute is very
different from that of the matrix. The activity co-
efficient, however, can be very different from unity
in this case, so that one cannot calculate the mole
fraction of the uranium pentachloride in thorium chlo-
ride until exact data are available.

Protactinium in the presence of chlorine is stable
as pentachloride, The vapour pressure data were recently
published by WEIGEL (6). The behaviour of this compound
with respect to the solubility in thorium chloride is
certainly similar to uranium pentachloride.

Results of the Calculations

The composition of the gas phase resulting from the
fluidized bed chlorination of thorium uranium oxide
is partly given by the reaction equation and by the
composition of the fuel. The chlorine partial pressure
is variable and depends on kinetic effects, resulting
in a more or less exhaustion of the chlorine, which is

651
fed into the fluidized bed. This exhaustion may be de-
fined by

4 exhaustion = 2 _X moles heavy metal chlorides‘100
2 x moles heavy metal chlorides + x moles Cl

Figures 2 and 3 show the partial pressures of the main

components ThClh, UClh, UC15, UCl6, co, C12' and 00012

as a function of the temperature for 50 % and 1 % ex-
haustion. The U:Th ratio is 5:95 and is nearly identical
with the ratio in an AVR fuel element. The main difference
between the two diagrams is the lower heavy metal chlo-
ride concentration in the latter case. The broken line
gives the vapour pressure of solid uranium tetrachloride.
The difference between the calculated partial pressure
pUClh and the vapour pressure pOUCl in the range of

ThC1l, condensation represents the thermodynamic activity
of UCl1, in ThCl,. One can see, that a low uranium chlo-
ride con%ent results in a low uranium tetrachloride ac-
tivity in the solid phase.

From the different slope of the two curves the ac-
tivity of uranium tetrachloride is a function of the tem-
perature resulting in fractions of thorium chloride with
different uranium content. In most cases the thurium
chloride, which condenses later is richer in uranium
than the first fraction. Thereforswe have calculated
the activity and the mole fraction of uranium tetrachlo-
ride in the condensed thorium chloride for temperature
intervals of 10 degrees. After the summation of these
results one can calculate the fraction of the total
uranium, which is codeposited with thorium chloride.

Some results of the calculations are given in fig.4,
in which the uranium loss ((UCl, codeposited with ThClu)/
UClh(total))is shown as a function of the mole fraction

of uranium in the gas phase for the chlorination of oxides
and carbides. One can see that the uranium loss increases
in a remarkable way with increasing mole fraction of
uranium, For a given U:Th ratio the losses are somewhat
lower in the case of chlorination of carbides.

A higher total pressure, which drives reactions 4
and 5 more to the side of the penta and hexachloride,
results in very high uranium losses, because the partial
pressure of uranium tetrachloride increases by a factor
of 3 to 5 when the total pressure increases by a factor
of 10,

Mostly we operate near the minimum fluidization velocity.
Therefore the chlorine exhaustion can amount to 50 %

and the uranium losses are too high,

There are two ways to decrease the percentage of
uranium codeposited with thorium chloride. The simplest
method is to dilute the reaction gas by injection of
chlorine behind the chlorinator. This is partially veri-
fied, for instance, in condensers in which the reaction
gas is cooled by injection of cold chlorine. The dis-
advantage of this method is, that the quantitative de-
position of uranium hexachloride becomes very difficult
at low uranium partial pressures.

Another way of condensation is the deposition of
thorium chloride in a column filled with an inert ma-
terial and having a small temperature gradient. When
the main reaction is over and the column is flushed
with nearly pure chlorine, the thorium chloride is
transported along the column, The thorium chloride
sublimes several times and the uranium content is re-
duced strongly. First experiments have shown, that ura-
nium losses are lower than 0.5 %.

Now we are developing these two types of condensers
in laboratory scale.

ABSTRACT

Basic thermodynamic relations for the description of binary
phase boundaries are developed. Their application to the calcula-
tion of thermodynamic properties from phase boundary data and in
checking the consistency of phase boundaries with known thermo-
dynamic data are outlined, Thermodynamic properties cannot be
calculated from phase boundary data alone, Data for the pure com-
ponents and assumed empirical parametric relations can be employed
to calculate useful information in favorable cases. The use of
empirical relations in the correlation of known properties for
binary systems is demonstrated and their application to the calcu-
lation of thermodynamic properties for the liquid phase in simple
eutectic systems and for the solid phase in miscibility gap systems
was investigated,

INTRODUCTION

The molar properties for a pure stable substance in the absence
of surface or field effects may be represented by some function
Y = Y(P,T}), where Y is any molar property and P and T are the pres-
sure and temperature, respectively., A unique P-T surface describes
each of the states of aggregation, The intersections of these sur-
faces project on the P-T plane as the unary phase diagram'. For
binary systems the molar properties are functions of three variables,
Y = Y(P,T,X). The complete phase diagram can be represented in
three dimensional P,T,X space. Most binary phase diagrams of metal-
lurgical interest are constant pressure, | atmosphere, sections of
the general three dimensional diagrams, The intersection of the
surfaces, Y = Y(C,T,X), where C is one atmosphere, project on the
T,X plane as the usual binary phase boundaries®. C(onsequently, the
phase boundaries are thus related to the state properties, but these
properties cannot be evaluated from the phase diagram alone, addi-
tional information is needed. |In principle, all of the thermodynamic
properties may be calculated from the binary phase boundaries if we
know the correct form of the equation relating the free energy or
activity coefficient to the variables P,T,X or to T and X if P is
fixed. Unfortunately no general equation of state of this type has
yet been developed. Various parametric equations have been devel-
oped or prgposed by Hildebrand and Scott3, Lumsden™, Krupkowski5,
Guggenheim®, and other authors, Partial summaries have been given
by Wagner/ and Perry®., The use of the Van Laar, Margules,
Scatchard-Hamer equations as well as relations of a more general
type to represent the activity coefficients of components in binary
and ternary systems has been discussed in some detail by Wohl9,
Some basic considerations and developments in the theory of alloy
phases have been more recently reviewed by Kleppalo, Orriani and
Alcock!!, and Turkdogan and Darken!2,

The thermodynamic properties of the metallic elements at one
atmosphere pressure are quite well known, This is also true for
the pure components of many salt systems. These data permit calcu-
lation of the thermodynamic properties for solutions from phase
boundary data in some favorable cases. However, the development of
a relation for the excess free energy as a function of temperature
and composition usually requires the evaluation of four or more
empirical parameters and calculations are tedious, The advent of
the modern computer has alleviated much of the computational
drudgery and there has been a growing interest in such calcula-
tions!3-17,

Phase diagrams and thermodynamic data are particularly helpful
in the development of new or more efficient reprocessing methods
for nuclear fuels as well as in other engineering applications and
in the development of the theory of alloy phases and heterogeneous
equilibria in general. The purpose of this paper is to derive and
summarize general thermodynamic relations which describe the phase

660

boundaries of constant pressure binary systems and which can be
employed to check the consistency of the phase boundaries with
thermodynamic data or conversely to calculate thermodynamic proper-
ties from phase boundary data. The application of empirical rela-
tions to the calculation or estimation of thermodynamic properties
from simple eutectic and miscibility-gap binary-phase boundaries
will be evaluated.

BASIC RELATIONS FOR T-X DIAGRAMS

For a heterogeneous system at equilibrium the chemical potential,
Wi or ﬁi and the fugacity, f;, for a particular component i must be
constant throughout the system; the fugacity must be equal in each
phase present. This fact is the basis for the derivations which
are to follow, Subscripts will be used to indicate the component
and superscripts to indicate the phase in question,

The fugacity or escaping tendency and the chemical potential
were defined by Lewis and Randal1183by the relation

G;

=RT In f; + B (n
where B is a function of temperature only., Since there is no way
of fixing an exact value to B we are restricted in our measurements

to relative values or
(G; - 6;°) = AG; = RT In £;/F;° (2)

where Gio and fio are the chemical potential and fugacity, respec-
tively, of component i in some reference or standard state, and

AG; is the relative partial molar free energy. The standard state,
uniess otherwise indicated, will be taken to be the pure component
at one atmosphere pressure at the same temperature and in the state
of aggregation of the solution in question, The quantity AG; then
represents the isothermal change in free energy for the process of
adding one mole of pure component i to a large reservoir of solu-
tion which essentially remains fixed in composition., This process
will be indicated, in the case of a liquid solution, and component
A for example, by the relation

A(4) - A(g,s0ln), AG = AGp = RT In ap (3)

Equation 2 also defines the activity a; and for condensed phases
a; = fi/fi0=XiYi (L")
where X is the mole fraction and Y is the activity coefficient.

With two phases, | and Il in equilibrium we can write from Eq. &

661
where the superscripts ' and '' refer to phase | and Il respectively.
Taking logarithms of both sides, assuming constant pressure, and
differentiating with respect to 1/T gives

The left side of this relation is restricted to compositions and
temperatures defined by the boundary between phase | and the two-
phase field of | and |l while the right side is restricted to the
boundary between phase Il and the same | plus |l phase field. Along
a phase boundary ¥ is a function of both temperature and composi-
tion. Consequently for a two component system

It can also be shown that

In these expressions M. is the relative partial molar enthalpy
and AH?? ' is the standard enthalpy change for the transformation

The relative excess partial molar free energy is defined as A8 =

yields

and an analogous relation holds for phase |1, The slopes of the
phase boundaries for any two coexisting phases in a binary T-X
diagram must satisfy Eq. (9b). This equation has been derived by
a somewhat different procedure by Williamson!Sb,

The slopes of the phase boundaries can also be expressed in
terms of the relative excess partial molar entropies, A§¥S The

enthalpy terms in Eq. (9b) can be combined to yield a single term
Aﬁi which is the isothermal change in enthalpy for the equi-
librium transfer of one mole of component i from phase 11 to phase

where AH.” has the significance discussed above. This equation
has been derived by Kirkwood and Oppenheimlgc,but has no particular
advantage over the Eqs. (9b) or (11) and will not be considered
further. Eq. (12) is one form of the Gibbs-Konovalow relation
which has been applied to the description of binary phase bound-
aries by Franzen and Gerstein!

The chemical potentials for a component in two equilibrium
phases are equal, and therefore

This equation and Eq. {5) are general and hold regardless of the
number of components or phases present whereas Eg. (3) is restricted
to a univariant (one degree of freedom) system and if more than two
components are present Eq. (7a) must be modified, The composition
terms and phase boundary slopes in these equations can be obtained
directly from the phase diagram, It should also be noted that Egs.
(9b) and (11) may be obtained by appropriate differentiation of
Eq. (13). Only constant pressure diagrams will be considered in
the following presentation. The entropy, free energy, and enthalpy
terms are functions of both temperature and composition and can not
be evaluated without additional information,

Another relation which is helpful in the analysis of phase dia-
grams results from the fact that the sum of the changes occurring
in any state property along a closed path must be zero or

$dy = 0. (14)
EUTECTIC SYSTEMS WITH NEGLIGIBLE OR LIMITED SOLID SOLUBILITY

Considerable information can be calculated from the phase bound-
aries of a simple eutectic system if the thermodynamic properties
of the pure components are known, For each two-phase region there
are two equations of the type (9b) and two of the type (13) which
describe the phase boundaries, For the A-rich liquidus, £, which
is in equilibrium with an A-rich solid solution, o, Eqs. (13) give

- £ - y f

MGy MGy RT In X3/x," - 4G, (15a)
MRS 4 ARKS® o T In XY - A (15b)
B B B’ "B B

A similar pair of equations hold for the B-rich liquidus and B-rich
solidus boundaries and another pair for the two boundaries below
the eutectic temperature.

In (15a), A6, ¥ is negligibly small in accord with the condition
that the solid pPhase @ is nearly pure A, , With this simplification
Eq. (15a) may be used to calculate Aﬁﬁs’ for T,X points defined by
the A-rich liquidus, The free energy of fusion of any component i
is calculated according to the relation

AG?’FUS = AH? - TAS? (16)

where the enthalpy and entropy terms are functions of temperature

664
and may be expressed as

AH? = AH. + s¢, dT (17)

d InT. (18)

—

AHi and Asi are the standard enthalpy and entropy of fusion, respec-
tively, at the melting temperature T and ACp is the difference in
the heat capacity of the liquid and solid states of pure component i.
If the temperature span is small or if ACp is small the integrals in
(17) and (18) may be relatively insignificant and consequently are
sometimes neglected. In the latter case Eq. (15a) reduces to

xs , 4

- L. o 3 %
AG, = -RT ln(XA/XA) - MM, + TAS (19)

A A

Equation (15b) cannot be simplified and unless both components, A
and B, have the same crystal structure it is not possible to calcu-
late the last term on the right side. This term represents the free
energy of fusion of pure B in the alpha form, If A and B have the
same crystal structure then this term is evaluated simply as the
free energy of fusion of B, otherwise it is necessary to know the
free energy of transition of B to the o form,

Below the eutectic temperature the two solid phases are only
very sparingly soluble in one another, If the crystal structures
are the same, the last terms in the analogous pair of equations
are zero and the relation for the B component in the alpha solid
solution becomes

ATES Y = RT 1n(x¥/xB) = AR® - TaSXSH® (20)
BB B B

and a plot of log(Xg/XE) against (1/T) will yield a straight line
from which AHg and ASES*¥ may be determined from the slope and
intercept, respectively., The curve represents the solubility as a
function of temperature of a sparingly soluble solute B in the A-
rich solid solution and Aﬁg and A§§5'“ are the limiting values of
the relative partial molar enthalpy and excess entropy respectively,
If the two solids do not have the same crystal structure the plot

will still yield a straight line but the slope and intercept yield
(AHg + Aﬁg’aﬂ“) and (A§§S’“ + &SS’BﬁQ) respectively. This fact is
sometimes neglected in the interpretation of such data, The same
arguments apply for data on sparingly soluble solutes in liquid

665
metals., Methods of calculating or estimating the free energy of
allotropic transformations for pure metals have been investigated
by Kaufman!9 and Roy and Kaufman20,

The Eq. (9b) also can yield useful information., For points along
the A-rich liquidus it takes the form

known melting point lowering equation

Similar equations may be written for the B-rich liquidus and at the
eutectic temperature g&A = géB and Eq. (21) and its B-component

It should be noted that Eqs. (23) and (25) apply only for the three
phase equilibrium at the eutectic temperature and that dT/dXp does

not equal -dT/dXp, these two quantities are the slopes of the B-rich

666
and A-rich liquidus curves at the eutectic temperatuEe, resp%ctively.

A1l the quantities in these two equations, except AFg and AHp in

Eq. (23) and Agﬁs’t and Agﬁs’z in Eq. (25) may be determined from

the phase diagram or calculated from the known properties of the
pure components, |If any one of the four unknown quantities is
determined the other three may be calculated from these equations
and the relation Aﬁ?s = Aﬁi - TA§?S. Consequently these relations
are helpful in checking the consistency of the phase diagram with
the thermodynamic data or vice versa, Further evaluation of thermo-
dynamic properties from the phase diagram requires additional in-
formation.

SYSTEMS WITH COMPLETE MISCIBILITY

|f the components A and B have the same crystal structure, it is
possible to have complete solid miscibility at high temperatures
and the formation of a solid miscibility gap at low temperature.
The liquidus=solidus curves may show a maximum or a minimum or may
show neither as in the silver-gold system.

Liquidus=Solidus Curves, Liquidus-solidus curves which meet only
at the melting temperatures of the pure components yield very little
direct thermodynamic information. The sliopes of the solidus and
liquidus are related to the heats of fusion of the pure components
by Eqs. (9b). The simple melting point lowering Eq. (22) does not
apply since the solidus slope cannot be neglected, Similarly the
Eqs. (13) cannot be simplified. These equations can be employed
to calculate T,X points for the liquidus and solidus curves if
thermodynamic data for the liquid and solid solutions are available.
If both the liquid and solid solutions obey Raoult's law the excess
free energy terms are zero and T,X points are simply related to the
free energy of fusion of the pure components,

If a minimum exists, the two curves are tangent at the minimum
and dXﬁ/dT = dXi/dT = o, and X& = XX, Eq. (9b) becomes igdeter-
i

minate and it may be shown that this requires that g§- = g7, or

Eq. (13) shows that the difference in the excess free energies be-
comes equal to the respective free energies of fusion and may be
calculated from data for the pure components,

Other useful relationships may be illustrated by consideration
of the following elementary isothermal reactions or processes,

667
A(s) = A(L) AGA

A(L) ~A(L,s0ln) 4G (27)
A{s,soln) = A(s) - 5,

A(s,soln) = A(2,s0ln) AG = 0

The sum of the free energy terms yields Eq. (13), Since Xﬁ = XR

the ideal partial molar free energies cancel and the difference in
the excess partial molar free energies may be determined from the
free energy of fusion which is the result indicated by (13}, It
should be noted that although the free energy of transfer of a mole
of A from the solid to the liquid phase is zero this is not true

As in the case for the free energy the ideal entropy terms cancel.

Stmitarly the melting of the solid solution at the minimum may
be analyzed in terms of the following isothermal cycle,

XAA(s) + XBB(S) - AXABXB(S)

The sum of the free energy terms, starting with the top reaction
and proceeding clockwise, gives, respectively,

Therefore a knowledge of the free energies of fusion of the pure

The ideal entropies of mixing cancel and the left side of the last
equation reduces to the difference in the excess entropies of mix-
ing, |If the entropy of fusion for the solid solution is estimated
by the method outlined by Kubaschewski and Evans2!, the sum of the
terms on the right side is approximately zero for a disordered sotid
solution, The above relations hold equally well for a maximum in
the liquidus-solidus curves,

Equation (31) has been employed by Wagner22 to calculate the dif-
ference in the excess molar free energy at the liquidus minimum for
a number of systems,

Miscibility Gap Maximum, At the maximum in a miscibility gap the
first and second derivatives of the partial molar free energy and
the second and third derivatives of the molar free energy of mixing
with respect to composition are all zero as described by Darken and
Gurry23. Consequently

must also be satisfied. As was observed for a liquidus-solidus
maximum or minimum dX/dT is infinite and Eq. (9b) becomes indeter-
minate. However, at the miscibility gap maximum the sum of the
enthalpy terms in {9b) becomes zero and Eqs. {34) apply. For tem-
peratures below the critical temperature Eqs. (9b) and (13) must be
satisfied,

SYSTEMS WITH COMPOUNDS

The maximum in a liquidus curve may be associated with a con-
gruent melting line compound., The relation of the thermodynamic
properties of the liquid phase to those for the solid or compound
phase may be formulated in terms of an isothermal cycle such as (29)
above. The free energy change for the top reaction in this cycle
may now be considered as the standard free energy of formation per
gram-atom of the compound instead of per mole of compound. The sum
of the free energy terms is identical with (30) with the term AG
replaced by the more conventional term AGO(AXABXB) used in relation

to the standard free energy of formation of compounds. The enthalpy
terms and entropy terms give sums analogous to (32) and (33). For
temperatures below the melting point of the compound the terms

AG%; AHﬁ and ASé represent the integral quantities per gram-atom
of supercooled liquid with the composition of the compound,

669
Another isothermal cycle which can prove useful involves the
equilibrium between the solid compound and the saturated liquid of
liquidus composition and temperature., For convenience, consider a
mole of compound with the stoichiometry AB, This isothermal, iso-
baric cycle may then be expressed as

A(2,s0ln) + B(£,soln} = AB(s)
¢ 4 ¥ (35)

A(2) + B(4) < AB(4)

The liquid solution AB(4) is a hypothetical supercooled liquid with
the same composition as the compound or solid phase. The first
relation in the cycle implies that the solid compound AB(s) dissoci-
ates and dissolves as A and B atoms in the liquidus solution, The
sum of the free energy terms is

A'Gfus

ASAB + ASAB - 288 + AsB + ASA =0 (38)

The term Aﬁig represents the change in enthalpy for the transfer of
one mole of AB from the liquid phase to the solid AB phase, AHy
represents the molal enthalpy of mixing for the supercooled lqutd
of compound composition (XA 0.5 in this case) and the term Aﬁm is
the corresponding molar free energy of mixing. Equation (36) may
be written as

If the liquid solution is ideal the excess free energy terms are
zero and the relation

defines the symmetrically spaced ideal-liquidus-points on either

below the melting temperature the right side of (40a) may be calcu-

2 **=

which may be solved for the two values of XB for a particular tem-
perature below T,

Wagner2h has developed procedures for calculating or estimating
the standard free energy of formation of line compounds from phase
diagram data and data for the pure components. His relations are
more complicated than the above equations and the assumption of
ideal or regular solution behavior for the liquid is necessary in
order to calculate the free energy of formation. The above rela-
tions and procedures have been employed to calculate some thermo-
dynamic quantities for alloy systems for which experimental meas-

Further calculations of the free energy, enthalpy and entropy
for binary solutions requires the use of some parametric relation
for the temperature-composition dependence of these quantities, If
such a relation is assumed for the relative partial molar excess
free energy for one of the components, the relation for the other
component as well as relations for the enthalpy and entropy of the
solution in general are fixed, A number of calculations have been
carried out with the assumption that

MRS = (2 + X1 - X,) (412)

and a= o +BT, b=¢q' + B'T, and @, &', B, B' and n are constants,
Integration of the Gibbs-Duhem equation and basic thermodynamic
relations lead to

=X5 _ n-1 __n_ 2
85,7 = [a + bX,” (X, - =5 )] Xy (41b)
and n
A6%% = x. x_ [a + -bx—A ] (41c)
m A"B n+1

The assumption that a and b are linear functions of the temperature
is valid if Alp is negligible and is a reasonable assumption if the
temperature span to be considered is not large, The enthalpy quan-
tities corresponding to the three equations are obtained by divid-
ing through by the temperature and differentiating with respect to
1/T, The equations have exactly the same form with o and «'

replacing a and b respectively. The entropy relations are obtained

671
by differentiating with respect to T. These equations also have the
same form with B and B' replacing a and b respectively. The free
energy is a function of temperature and composition while the enthalpy
and entropy are a function of composition only. The above relations
have been used to correlate the measured thermodynamic properties for
several binary systemsZ2,2

Equation (4la) reduces to the regular solution approximation when
either b or n is zero and to the so-called sub-regular approximation
when n is one. When n is noninteger there is no simple relation be-
tween the respective parameters when the components are reversed, that
is, when the retation (4la) is assumed to hold for the B component,

The following equations which are analogous to those proposed by
Guggenheim® do not have this limitation and in calculations based on
phase diagram data it is immaterial which component is considered to

be A or B. These equations when limited to six parameters take the
form

EXS — 2 - 2

8Gx {a + bX, + <X21 (1 - X;) (42a)
-XS 2

86y = [a + b(x, - 1/2) + oX (X, - 2/3)] X} (42b)
XS = 2

i xAxB[a + bX, /2 + ch/3J. (42¢)

Here ACp is also assumed to be negligible and consequently a, b and

c may be linear functions of temperature with c = ¢''+ B'"'"T. The rela-
tions for a and b have been given above. These equations can success-
fully describe the measured thermodynamic properties for a large num-
ber of binary systems, The six parameters o, «', &', 8, B' and B"

for a number of binary systems were evaluated from the data summar-
ized by Hultgren, Orr, Anderson and Ke]ley27. The 20 partial molar
enthalpy data points, 10 for the A component and 10 for the B com=-
ponent, given for each system were fitted to the enthalpy relation

AHA = (o + a'Xy = a”Xﬁ](l - XA)Z (42d)

and -
AHB

(o + o' (Xy - 1/2) + &%y (Xp - 2/3)]x§ , (42e)

respectively. These 20 observation equations were reduced to three
normal equations by the Gauss method2® and the normal equations
solved for the three parameters o, @' and a@''. Similarly the 20
partial molar entropy data were fitted to

63X5 = [ + B'Xy + BXAI(T - Xa)2 (b2f)
ASES = [B + B'(Xay = 1/2) + B"Xa{Xa - 2/3)]X§ (L2g)

and the parameters B, B' and B'' calculated. These calculations

were carried out with the aid of a computer. The results are sum-
marized in Table |, The A component is listed first in the table,

Of the 30 sets of data examined, Equations (42d,e) and (L42f,g) repro-

duced the enthaipy and entropy data with a mean standard deviation
equal to or less than the estimated uncertainty at X = 0,5 as

tabulated by Hultgren et al., except for five systems each indi-
cated by an asterix in the Table. The largest mean deviation of 583
cal/mole was calculated for the enthaipy for the Au-Sn system which
compares with a value of + 200 listed in the Table.

It is to be expected that both Eq. (4la) and Eq. (42a) and the re-
lations derived from them will have limited applicability and cannot
be expected to adequately describe all binary systems. As pointed
out by Darken?d a much more complicated relation would be required
to describe the thermodynamic properties of the Mg-Bi system for
example, Most of the binary systems reviewed by Turkdogan and
Darken!2 are included in Table | and except for the few systems
noted above, their thermodynamic properties can be described quite
adequately by Eq. (42a) and its associated relations, The param-
eters listed by them for the terminal solutions can be employed to
calculate the parameters for Eq. (42a). The agreement with the
parameters listed in Table | is quite good. Conversely the param-
eters listed by Turkdogan and Darken may be calculated from the
relations (42) and the parameters in Table 1.

Estimation of Thermodynamic Properties for Simple Eutectic
Systems, Attempts were made to calculate parameters for several
eutectic systems from liquidus data. The liquidus temperatures and
compositions and the calculated excess free energies for liquidus

T,X points are summarized in Tables 1| and IV, Heats of fusion and
heat capacity data employed for the salt systems are summarized in
Table 111, Analogous data for the metal systems were taken from

Hultgren, Orr, Anderson and Kelley27. Except for the Zn-Cd system
the actual number of liquidus data points employed was greater than
the number listed in the tables., The free energy of fusion for
each temperature was calculated according to the Egs. (16-18). The
parameters for the Eq. {4la) were computed for temperatures common
to both the A-rich and the B-rich liquidus curves, The relations
employed were

Aﬁxslxé = a + bX] (43)

for the A-rich liquidus and

"x - Do) (44)

=xs , 2 n-
AGB /XA =a + bXA A e
for the B-rich liquidus. At any given temperature, a and b in
these two equations have values in common but Xp in (43) does not
have the same value as Xp in (4h4) except at the eutectic tempera-
ture. The value of Xp in (43) is the mole fraction of A for the
A-rich liquidus and Xa in (44) is the mole fraction of A for the
B-rich liquidus, The parameter a was eliminated by subtracting
(43) from (L44) to give a relation with .two unknowns, b and n,
Various values of n were assumed to calculate b and corresponding
values of a. In accord with the condition that Al, is small or
negligible both a and b should be linear or neariy linear functions

choice of an appropriate n value, The calculated parameters for
several of the assumed values of n are given in Table V. However,
the n which yielded parameters which best described the enthalpy
and entropy did not necessarily satisfy the foregoing criterion,

*Assumed value of n which yielded parameters which best fit the
known thermodynamic data.

The data in Table VI show that for the LiCl-KCl system the Egs.
(42a) and (L42b) are rather insensitive to the choice of n and
closely reproduce the input data given in the last column in the
Table, for n values ranging from 0.75 to 5.0, This same tendency
also was observed for the other systems investigated, As may be
seen in Fig, 1 the calculated enthalpy of mixing for the LiCl-KCI
system for n = 0,75 and n = 1,0 is in fair agreement with the
experimental data of Hersch and Kleppa3®. However the composition
dependence of the enthalpy for the LiC1-RbC1 and AgCl1-RbCl systems
is in error and agreement with the experimental data is fair only
for a limited composition range., Unlike the free energy, the
enthalpy is relatively sensitive to variations in the parameter n,
Furthermore the above criterion of minimum deviation in @, B and
a', B' for the choice of an optimum n value did not yield equations
which gave a best fit to the enthalpy or entropy data.

Miscibility Gap Systems, Some variation in the above procedure
was employed in calculating the parameters for several miscibility
gap systems. In the following development the solution on the A-
rich side of the gap is referred to as the | or prime phase and the
solution on the B-rich side as the Il or double prime phase. Only
systems in which phases | and 1l have the same structure are con=-
sidered, Therefore the free energy of transition term in Eq. (13)
is zero and it may be written as

At any given temperature both Egs. (46) and (L47) must be satis-
fied., Consequently, it was possible to write six relations for
the systems with only three data points. A larger number was pos=
sible for the other systems. The value of n was arbitrarily varied
from 0 to 6.0 in increments of 0,2 and @, B, &' and B' calculated,
Except for the Bi-Zn system it was again observed that the n value
which gave the lowest standard deviation for the input data

(RT Tn Xj/X; for Egs. (46) and (47)) did not yield relations which
best descrlbed the enthalpy data. Fairly good results were

680
obtained by assuming a and b to be temperature independent and
determining the n value which gave a minimum overall deviation for
the complete set of data., This n and mean a and b values were taken
to represent the best fit for the input data at the mean temperature.
Then employing this value of n, mean values of a and b were computed
from the data below the overall mean temperature and from the data
above this mean temperature, For the Cd-Ga and Cu-Pb systems the
middle temperature was employed in each set of data. This yielded
three values of each parameter, a and b, and three mean temperatures
for the three groupings of the phase diagram data. The temperature
dependence of a was then estimated graphically. A straight line
passing through the overall mean a,T point and with a slope which
was the mean of the slopes of the two straight lines connecting

this central point with the other two a,T points was taken to be

the most appropriate representation of the temperature dependence

of a or of the corresponding values of « and 8. The parameters o'
and B' were determined by the same procedure., The results of these
calculations are given in Table VII|Il, The set of parameters for

the Bi~-Zn system was determined by the first procedure described
above. The thermodynamic properties calculated with these parameters
for this system and similar data for the other systems are compared
with literature data in Figs, 2-4, The agreement is seen to be
reasonably good, The calculated critical temperatures are 1300,
1140, 860, 580, and 12009 for the Au-Ni, Pb-Zn, Bi-Zn, Cd-Ga and

of 1085, 1070, 878, 568 and 1203°%K, respectively. The agreement is
rather poor for the first two systems.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The thermodynamic properties of equilibrium phases are retated to
the phase diagram boundaries but cannot be evaluated from phase
boundary data alone. The basic relations {11), (13) and (14) are
helpful in correlating experimental thermodynamic data with binary,
constant pressure, phase boundary data. Simplifications are possible
for various boundary conditions which are encountered in different
types of phase diagrams or phase boundaries. Considerable thermo=-
dynamic information may be calculated for the liquid phase in simple
eutectic systems from the liquidus curve data and the properties of
the pure components. Calculations for other binary systems are re-
viewed,

If a parametric equation is known to describe the temperature-
composition dependence of the relative partial molar excess free
energy of one of the components, then in principle it is possible
to calculate the parameters from phase boundary data and to com-
pletely describe the thermodynamic properties of the phases involved,
It was shown that the relation

=X5

2 2
6B, = XB(a + bX, + ch),

A
in which a, b, and ¢ are linear functions of temperature, can ade-
quately describe the known excess free energy, enthalpy and entropy
for a large number of binary solutions, There are six parameters
to be determined. The evaluation of these parameters from phase
diagram data was not pursued in detail in this investigation., How-
ever, considerable work was done in evaluating the parameters in
the relation

BEX® = Xa(a + bX})
which also has been found to adequately describe a number of binary
solutions. Here a and b are linear functions of temperature and
the exponent n is assumed to be a constant. With this relation it
is necessary to determine only five parameters, The application of
this relation to the calculation of the thermodynamic properties
for the liquid phase of several eutectic salt systems and eutectic
metal systems was investigated, Parameters could be found which
closely reproduced the input AGA> and AGXS values calculated from
the liquidus T,X data. However, no reliable criterion was found
which adequately reproduced the known enthalpy or entropy data.
The free energy was not particulariy sensitive to the choice of n
and could be closely reproduced with a wide range of parameters.
This is not particularly surprising in view of the relation

AE?S = oA, - TA§?S

from which it is seen that Aﬁ?s can be satisfied by infinite sets
of Aﬁi and Ag?s values. At constant composition Aﬁi and Ag?s are

685
both insensitive to small temperature changes.

The same problems were encountered in evaluating parameters from
liquid or solid miscibility gap data. However, results were suffi-
ciently encouraging to warrant further investigations.

The calculated enthalpy or entropy values are sensitive to com-
putational procedures. The computations carried out in the present
work were based on the use of Eq, (13). At least one of the param-
eters can be eliminated by combination of Eqs. (13) and (11).
Equation (11) also involves phase boundary slopes which are more
directly related to the enthalpy or entropy values. These possibil-
ities and the Egs. (42) are being investigated,

Introduction

Let us consider the wideiy used free energy-common
tangent construction for determining phase limits in a
binary system, In Fig.1 are schematically presented
such curves at some temperature T, fer equilibria among
the phases &, s and ¥ in the bina}y system A-B, Also
presented is a phase diagram which is consistent with
the free energy curves at T., Clearly, at each temp-
erature vhere we know the ffee energies of each phase
we can construct the phase limits, We shall call this

proceedure synthesis,

The free energies F,, F, and F, are defined for all
compositions while the phase diagram defines only a
limited number of discrete compositions at each temp-
erature, Thus at each temperature the thermodynamic
information content of & phase diagram is much less
than we need to know, Hovever, possibly this infor-
mation content can be increased sufficiently by con-
sidering many temperatures to allow the derivation of
the thermodynemic functions, We shall call this

proceedure analysis,

The synthesis and analysis compubations are tecdious
and not practical without an electronic computer.
Eerein we shall formulate the thermodynamic equations,
discuss their solution, and present some examples of
computer syntheses and analyses for the real systems
Au-Ni, Al-Sn and Ag-Au, A detailed report of this
work, including computer programs, is being published
elsewhere (1),

Thermodynamic Formulation

To perform both the synthesis and analysis operations
it is necessary to analytically express the free energy
as a function of composition and temperature, We shall
generate all of the necessary thermodynamic functions
from a relative integral molar free energy of the form

F' = (1-x)aF, + xaFy + F> - 1870, (1)
where
AFE[AFB) = free energy of transformation of pure A(B)
from reference structure to phase structure,
SID = ideal integral molar configurational entropy,
Xs _ .
F = excess integral molar free energy.

EQe (1) is clearly best applicable to systems that are
substantially disordered and present consideration has
becen so limited., The crucial step in employing Eq. (1)

is the choice of the analytical form for F°°, We shall
limit conslderation to expansions of the form

M
FXS = x(1=x) 2%% aﬁ =, (2)
where "
F

= m th expansion consteant,
Thus (M +1) expansion constants are employed to define
the compositlon dependence of FA at each temperature,

Eqe.(2) is not a very original choice, It is essent-
1ally the expansion introduced by Margules in 1895 and
it is by far the most widely employed form today. The
usefulness of Eqe(2) derives from the fact that it
generally well represents the data with a small number of
constants, It is particularly important in analysis to
minimize the number of expansion ccnstants. There is no
proof that Eq.(2) possesses the minimum number of con-
stants nor that it is the best of all peossible forms,
Indeed many other expansion forms have becen employed
(2-) for thermodynamic data extrapolation, but whether
or not they possess any advantage for analysis remains
to be tested.,

The tempcrature dependence of FXS enters thrcough the

expansion ccnstants ai(T). Perhaps the most logical

F

proceedure is to similarly expand the a 's in a power

series in T, and this is in fact Jjust what Hiskes and
Tiller (5) have done, However, in order to more readily
relate to thermodynamic data tabulations we have based
our itemperature expansion on the relation

P = B - 1) );c dT-Tf (c®S/myar, (3

where

TO = reference temperature,

H§(S°XS)= excess enthalpy (entropy) at To ’

c®S = excess specific heat.

xS

The expansion of C in T determines to a large extent

692
the generallity of the applicgtion. In principle by

employing a sufficiently genersl expansion for C (T)

we could include systems with specific heat anomalies
(Curie points, order-disorder transformctionS,e..).
However, at this stage of progress we are having suffic-
lent problems with simple systems and we have not tried
to apply the calculotions to systems where the specific
heat is a function of temperature, It thus follows from
Eq,(3) that the most general form for the temperature
dependence of the expansion constants that we have used 1s

constants for s S amd C in
expansions of the form of Ege(2).

When only the first.4Mgt1) terms ira&g. (k) are non-

zero, we say that we have carried out an expansion to
Order(MT). We similarly define the complete composition-

femperature expansion as of Order(Mx,MT), and which will
require (MX+1)(MT+1) expansion constants, In Table 1

the present notation is related to various nomenclatures
that have fregquently been used to describe solution
thermodynamics behavior,

693
The difficulty of the calculations by pre-computer
methods 1s perhaps best exemplified by the fact that it
has long been appreciated that an Order(1,1) expansion
generally provides the minimum realistic description
for a binary alloy system, but neither syntheses nor
analyses have been reported for non-reguler solutions,
thet is, for MT70 °

To complete the desoription of the temperature depen-
dence of the free energy function of Eq.{(1), we anzlog-
ously emplcy

SInthesis

The miscibility cap is the simplest system fo treat
since it involves the thermodynamics of a singlc phase
only, Consider the miscibility gap of Fig.2a: we wish
to calculate the gap limits X, and Xy at arbitrary T,

The usual graphical common tanent method is i1ilustrated
in Fig.2b ., Another method of solution is by simultan-
eously solving the pair of partisl molar free energy
equations:

F’I\g(f}:,‘,T) - FI:(XE,T) =0 ] (63-)

i

F%(x1,T) - F%(XE,T) 0 (6by

At each T we thus have two equations in thz two unknowms
X, and Xy 0 A graphical solution is illustrated ir
Fig.zc.

In order to numerically solve Eqs,(6} we must first
explicitly express the partial molar free energles in
terms of the expansions given previously., Thic is
readilly accomplished by employing the well knovm

Our proceedure 1s to take the experimental thermo-
dynamic data, least squares f£it it to expansions of
the form given previously and generate the (Mx+1)(MT+1)

expansion constants, and then to solve the simultaneous
pair, Eqs,(6), for X and xo for various assumed btemp-

eratures, The simultaneous pair is transcendental and
cannot be solved by elementary mears but they are readily
solved by a computer by numericzal proceedures,

Tn Pig.3 is shown the misclbility gap in the Au-Ni
system, The experimental gap(6) and the gap synthsized
from thermodynamic data(7) can be compared. It is quite
clear that there is an inconsistency but is not our
purpose here to attempt to evaluate the source of error.

Let us now consider the general case of synthesis of
equilibria between phases of different structures:

and 4F , (AFB) are given by Eqs.(5).

In Fig.li is shown the liquid/solid equilibrium for
the Ag-Au system with both the experimentally determined
boundaries and the boundaries that we have computer
synthesized from thermodynaemic data(7). The liquidus?
agree fairly well but the solidus! differ badly. Again
we shall not attent to find the origin of the dlscrepency.

There is a particular case of equilibria with a
structure change that we must consider seperately: when
one of the terminal solubilities approaches zero., Let
us take phase 1 as the zero solubility phase. Then
there is effectively only one unknown, X9 the (A+2)/2

boundary, As x1ﬂ’0, F£Q+ -00, so0 that from Eq.(12b)

not consistent with the experimental phase diagram, so
it 1s not surprising that the analysis cderived thermo-

The formal extension of analysis to equilibria

Although we have developed such computer programs, in

we have really no feelin; for whether they are insur-
mountable or whether better algorithms and other expan-
sions can lead to reliable solutions, It is clear that
the phase diagram literature is a large cnd largely
untaped source of valuable thermodynamic data. Thus the
rewards for developing successful analysis arc ;5 eat
indeed and the pursult of further investigations 1into
the mathematics of analysis appear to be called for,

With the use of binary data, excess molar free energy values
and phase diagrams have been calculated for a number of ternary
systems. The equations used are considered to be rigorous for
regular ternary systems and empirical for nonregular systems.
The calculations are compared with experimental results where
possible., These results are found to give reasonable estimates
of AFXS for the Pb-Sn-Cd, Sb-Cd-Pb, Bi-Cd-Sn, and Cd-Pb-Bi
systems at 773°K, the Ca0-Si0,-FeO system at 1873°K, and the
Fe-Mn-Ni system at 1232°K. Iﬁ'xase diagrams have been calcu-
lated for the Pb-Sn-Zn system at 926°K and the Ag-Pd-Cu system
at 1000°K.

Introduction

Darken's work(l) provided the pertinent beginning for the math-
ematical treatment of ternary thermodynamics. He showed how
the Gibbs-Duhem equation may be used to calculate the excess
molar free energy of a ternary system from experimental excess
partial f%)lar free energy of one comp?cﬁent in the ternary. Later
Wagner*©/, Schuhmannl( » and Gokcen derived other useful
ternary relationships dealing, essentially, with mathematically
consistent solutions of the same problem.

The above approaches minimize the amount of experimental
data needed to define the thermodynamic properties of a given
ternary, and they may be extended to higher order, multicom-
ponent systems. However, it would be useful to find methods for
predicting the thermodynamic properties of a multicomponent
system from a limited amount of data as a supplement to experi-
mental measurements and analytical studies. This has been re-
cognized with the considerable work that has been done to find
models to predict or extend thermodynamic properties and phase
diagrams, throu%’x gsrious interpolative schemes, in binary and
ternary systems'” 7Y/,

Equations derived from Darken's wo }1((1) ay be used to pre-

{él&ry excess molar free energies and phase dia-

grams from binary data. This work is reviewed and addition-
al calculations on the Pb-Sn-Cd, Cd-Pb-Bi and Ca0-8i0,-FeO
systems are presented. Although the equations are rigorous only
for regular solutions, they give results in fair agreement with ex-
perimental measurements for several nonregular systems.

Calculation of Ternary Excess Free Energy Using Binary
Data and the Regular Solution Model

The excess molar free energy of a ternary solution (AF*%) in
terms of the activity coefficient ¥, of component 2 may be written

Ni(j) mole fraction of component i in the i - j binary

When the binary data are known, Eq. (1) lends itself directly to
interpolative approaches because an estimate of the first integral
in the equation is all that is needed to calculate AF¥X®., However,
the physical significance of any such estimate must be given
serious consideratio%. There are perhaps many ways of solving
this kind of problem( 1), but a good beginning would be to make
any estimate of In y, meet the following conditions:

[ln Y, = In 72(1)}

N3 = 0
[1“ Yo = In 72(3)] N, = 0 (2)
[AFXS = (AFT:)Nl/Ns] N, = 0

That is, any analytical substitution of In ¥, into Eq. (1) must
force Eq. (1) to collocate with the known, ginary’, boundary data.
It has been found(18) that the following substitution for ln v, into
Eq. (1) would fulfill these conditions,

Therefore, it is apparent that the introduction of Eq. (3) into
Darken's Eq. (1) gives the ternary excess molar free energy in
terms of the & function in a form characteristic of a regular solu-
tion(5» 15) and it is for this case that Eq. (3) is considered to be
rigorous. At N2 = 0, Eq. (3) reduces to the equation presented b
Darken“), Alcock and Richardson - , and Oriani and Alcockh5)
to determine the activity coefficient of component 2 in dilute solu-
tion with components 1 and 3.

Examination of Eqs. (3) and (4) indicates that they are path
dependent for nonregular solutions, i.e., the calculated value of
the ternary excess molar free energy will depend on the choice of
component 2. Hence, it would be desirable to obtain similar ex-
pressions which are path independent. This may be done readily
by chosing the path geometry shown in Fig. 1(b) and making sub-
stitutions into Eq. (5) as follows,

The terms of Egs. (7) and (8) are shown in Fig. 1(b).

In summary, Eqs. (3), (4), (7) and (8) meet the collocation cri-
teria defined in Eq. (2). The introduction of either Eq. (3) or Eq.
(8) into Eq. (1) makes the first integral on the right-hand side of
Eq. (1), when integrated from N, = 1 to Ny =0, have the same
numerical value as it would have in the actual system, even if the
system is nonregular. This means that the terminal slope, at
N, = 1, of the AF*® surface along a path with constant Ny /N3 is
the same as for the actual system. However, the integral would
be exact, in general, when integrated from Ny, = l to any NZ only
for regular systems. The possible graphical difference between
the calculated and actual integrals is shown schematically in Fig.
2. Since the calculated AF*S surface using either Eq. (3) or (8)in
Eq. (1) reduces to the known binary values, it is expected that the
most accurate calculated data would be near the sides and apexes
of the ternary triangle and the largest errors would occur in the
central regions.

It would now be instructive to calculate the ternary excess mo-
lar free energy of several systems where experimental results
are known. Using Eq. (7), results were calculated for five sy-
stems and they are shown in Figs. 3-7. Liquid standard states of
the pure components were used in each case. The experimental
binary and ternary data for the Pb-Sn-Cd and Cd-Pb-Bi systems
at 773°K, Figs. 3 and 4, were taken from Elliott and Chipman(?’z),
and experimental data for the Ca0-5i0,-Fe0 system at 1873°K, Fig.
5, has been summarized by Elliott 33)2. For the Sb-Cd-Pb system
at 773°K, the experimental binary and ternary data has also been
determined by Elliott and Chipman(32). The calculated results for
the Bi-Cd-Sn system at 773°K are shown in Fig. Z Z?d compared
with the experimental ternary results by Melgren 3 Experi-
mental binary data for the Bi-Sn system were taken from Melgren,
and Elliott and Chipman's Bi-Cd and Cd-Sn data were used for the
calculations.

Eq. (7) was used for the calculations because of its path inde-
pendent nature. However, Eq. (4) will produce similar results
if the calculated excess free energy curve is taken as the mean
from three integration paths corresponding to the selection of each
component as component 2. This may be verified by matching the
appropriate excess freje energy contours in Figs. 3-5 with Figs.
3-8 in Toop's work(18), Elaboration on the advantages and dis-
advantages of using Egs. (4) or (7) for the purpose of calculations
is given in the discussion.

miscibility gaps(5' 10, 24), Meijering(s’ 10) used Eq. {5) to calcu-
late ternary excess free energy of mixing values after he had de-
termined appropriate @j.j constants. An alternate expression which
gives AF*® for regular solutions as a function of binary values of
AFX% along composition paths with constant Ny/N,, N,/N3 and
Nl/l\'}3 has been given in Eq. (7). This expressu)n for AFXS is
more useful for the empirical calculation of ternary excess free
energy values for nonregular systems because actual binary AF*S
data may be used in the expression rather than attempting to fmd
suitable constants for Eq. (5). Further results of this feature of
Eq. (7) are illustrated in Table I where calculated excess free

Although regular solution equations have been shown, in this
paper, to give calculated thermodynamic quantities which agree
quite well with experiment for single-phase nonregular ternary
systems, care should be exercised i1n the use of the equations to
predict thermodynamic properties of multiphase ternary systems
in which strong compound formation 1s suspected. This precaution
15 consistent with the simple regular solution model which for ne-
gative values of @, . will indicate a tendency toward compound for-
mation, but even very large negative values of @ _. will not give
multiphase binary or ternary systems involving a Jdlstlnct stable
compound. Hence, calculated ternary free energy data using Eq.
(7) mMght be expected to vary between being rigorous and poor, 1in
the following order, for ternary systems which are. a) regular
solutions, b) nonregular single-phase liquids in which random
mixing 1s nearly realized, c¢) nonregular single-phase solids, d)
nonregular multiphase systems with binary compounds but no ter-
nary compounds, f) nonregulat multiphase systems with highly
stable binary and ternary compounds. The calculated data will be
expected to be least accurate for the last two cases.

To empirically predict phase boundaries in ternary solutions
with the use of Eq. (7), the problem involves calculating and dis-
playing the free energy of the mixing (AF) surface and then deter-
mining common tangent points or tie lines on this surface. To
achieve this, a method for graphically contouring the free energy
of mixing surface was considered. In Fig. 8, calculated AF/RT
contours are shown for a hypothetical regular ternary system in
which all the ¢ _; values are constant and equal to 3. The contours
were drawn with'a mechanical plotting device and the phase diagram
consisting of three single -phase regions, three two-phase regions
and one three-phase region, ts clearly defined. Because of the
symmetry of this system, the tie lines across the two phase re-~
grons are parallel to the triangle sides. For more complex non-
regular ternary systems in which the directions of the tie lines were
unknown, the contouring method was found to be less promising.

The method adopted 1n this paper 1s more general and involves
two-dimensional plots of ternary activity curves. The principle
used 15 that tie lines indicating two-phase equilibria join conjugate
phases @ and B for example, for which aj{a) = aj(8), az(@) = a(8) and a3(a)

= a3(B). Tie lines may be determined by plotting the ternary
activities of two components along an i1soactivity line for the third
component, and the unique points where the above equalities hold
may be found graphically. The ternary activities of all three com-
ponents may be found with the use of Eq. (8). For the present work,
this method was used to calculate the phase diagrams for the Pb-
Sn-Zn system at 926°K and the Ag-Pd-Cu system at 1000°K.

The Pb-Sn-Zn System at 926°K
1(6)

Lumsden's mode has been shown to define the the rmodynamic

715
proFf t1es of the Pb-Zn system with a liquid phase miscibility
gap at 926°K. The miscibility gap should extend into the
Pb-Sn-Zn ternar f)iom the Pb- Zn binary as illustrated by exper-
imental evidence at 793°K. Using Eqs. (7) and (8) it is possible
to calculate the ternary liguid miscibility gap with Lumsden's eq-
uations for the Pb-Zn system and appropriate binary data for the
liguid phases in the Pb-Sn and Sn-Zn systems at 926°K.

The AF:® a(ta6 for the Pb-Sn system at 773°K was taken from
Hultgren, et al(3 Since this system is considered to be regular,
the necessary free energy data at 926°K could be obtained readily
by assuming that the excess free energy is independent of tempera-
ture.

Free energy data for the Sn-Zn system is available(36) at 700°K
The integral molar free energy of mixing, AF, for this system was
calculated at 926°K b)g assuming that the AC,, values for the various
alloy compos1t10ns were independent of temperature between
700°K and 926°K.

Using the appropriate binary data, the isoactivity lines for
zinc, shown in Fig. 9, were calculated using Eq. (8). By com-
puting apy and ag along an isoactivity line for Zn, there must be
one unique pair of composition points where ap (L ) = app(Ls) and
agn{Ljy) = agp(Lp) which defines the two-phase %oundary as shown
in Fig. 10. After using the same procedure along all of the iso-
activity lines of Zn, the entire miscibility gap was calculated and
it is defined by the dashed line in Fig. 9. The final calculated
phase diagram for the Pb-Sn-Zn system at 926°K is shown in Fig.
11. The shape of the calculated miscibility gap at 926°K compares
reasonably well with the shape of the miscibility gap at 793°K
as shown in Fig. 11. In drawing the latter curve, the Pb-rich
phase boundary was modifie% slightly to be consistent with the cur-
rent Pb-Zn phase diagram

The Ag-Pd-Cu System at 1000°K

The Ag-Pd-Cu system should contain a region of solid phase
immiscibility at 1000°K due to the miscibility gap in the Ag-Cu
system. Since no experimental phase equilibria exists for this
system, to the authors' knowledge, the ternary miscibility gap at
1000°K was predicted using Eqs. (7) and (8). Both the Ag-Pd and
Pd-Cu systerms are single-phase (fCéI) at this temperature and
the rmodynamic data are available(3 Thermodynamic data for
the terminal regions of the Ag-Cu system are available at 1052°K
so that extrapolations had to be made over the two-phase region.
For the purpose of extrapolation, it is useful to use the parameter

where the &'s need not be constant. In the Ag-Cu system at 1052°K,
it was found that § is constant in both of the terminal single -phase
regions and it was assumed that &Ffggeg = AF{§52°K in these
regions. In the two-phase region of this binary, it was assumed
that @ varies linearly between the constant value 2. 86 on the Ag-rich
side, and 3.48 on the Cu-rich side. This gave values of @ over the
entire system and permitted calculation of a AF versus composition
curve for the Ag-Cu system at 1000°K. The AF curve is shown in
Fig. 12 and it a(ggsees well with the phase diagram adopted by
Hultgren, et al .

Isocactivity curves for Cu were calculated using Eq. (8) and the
ternary miscibility gap was established in the same manner used
for the Pb-Sn-Zn system. The phase diagram, given in Figs. 13
and 14, shows a predicted miscibility gap which extends over a
substantial region of the ternary.

Discussion

The equations presented in this paper are considered to be
rigorously applicable to regular ternary solutions. Although the
method is empirical for nonregular ternary systems, the expres-
sions give a fair approximation of measured ternary excess free
energy for the systems shown in Figs. 3-7 and Table I.

There are several reasons which help one to decide whether
to use Eqs. (3) and (4), or Eqs. (7) and (8). First, one should
keep in mind that Eqs. (3) and (4) are path dependent, but this
factor has not b E.'él) shown to be a major contribution to errors in
the calculations!18). The use of Eq. (4) along a single path differs
from the results calculated with Eq. (7) for the systems in Figs.
3-7 and Table I by less than 5%. When, for example, binary data
is only available for dilute solutions of N.,, and one is only interest-
ed in the dilute region of the ternary, Eq. (7) can not readily be
used since it requires data for the 1-2 and 2-3 binaries for higher
N, ,., compositions than the ternary N, compositions. However,
E%M; can easily be used because it never requires binary data at
No(i) compositions greater than N>. Graphical aids are also pos-
sible with Eqs. (3) and (4)(18) which result in requiring about 1/3
the number of calculations (along a single path) associated with
Eqs. (7) and (8). However, in order to receive the full benefit of
the interpclative method of this paper, Fig. 2, all three components
should be used for component 2 and the calculated result taken as
the mean of the three independent sets of calculations. This would
be time consuming for the methods used to predict phase diagrams,
so Eqs. (7) and (8) were used for the phase diagram determination.

Previous diS(:ussion(lS’ 19) has been given on why regular so-

lution equations might be applied, with some empirical success,
to nonregular systems containing more than two components.

Further support of this view, as well as a clearer definition of the
limitations involved, may be found in the basic assumptions of the
simple regular solution model. The assumption of random mixing
and constant coordination rumber allows calculation of the number
of nearest neighbor bonds. The assumption of constant atom-atom
interaction then permits an energy summation to be made to give
the integral molar heat of mixing, or the excess free energy, for
the regular solution. The regular solution equations which result,
for example Eqs. (4) and (7) show that at compositions near any bi-
nary system i-j, the excess free energy due to the i-j interaction
is predominant. For compositions in which the concentrations of
1 and j become small, ihe i-j contribution rapidly diminishes due
to the factor (N + N. )

Now, any rnultlcornponent system is bounded by a series of bi-
nary systems, all of which contribute to the multicomponent field
with the addition of 3rd, 4th or nth components. Considering any
binary i-j composition, even though the excess entropy may be
nonzero, the actual AF¥S value is known and may be used as a
starting peoint. As other components are added and are present in
dilute or moderate concentrations, they are likely to be incorporated
into the system in a random manner while not altering a.pprema.bly
the i-j coordination or interaction. Hence, the predominant i-j
contribution to the total excess free energy might be expected to
follow the form of Eqs. (4) and (7} at least at compositions in the
vicinity of the binary edges of the multicomponent system. This
would most likely be so if the components are substitutional. This
kind of agreement between measured data and the regular solution
equations has been presented in this paper. The accuracy with
which the excess free energy curves extend into the interior of the
multicomponent field will clearly be better for systems which do
not exhibit abrupt changes in excess free energy as might be en-
countered with the occurrence of a ternary compound.

The e%uatlons of this paper have been extended into quaternary
systems and the approach may readily be extended to higher
order systems although the graphical relationships become very
complex.

The methods presented in this paper are considered to give a
fair approximation of ternary phase diagrams exhibiting miscibility
gaps as shown in Figs. 11 and 14. It is apparent that this method
may be applied to more complex nonregular systems with more
than one miscibility gap. If two or more miscibility gaps intersect
and the directions of the tie lines at the points of intersection are
not parallel, the tie lines at the points of intersection will form
the sides of a three phase triangle. This general feature is shown
ideally in Fig. 8.

In the calculation of thermodynamic properties of multicomponent
systems with the equations presented, the binary excess free energy

722
data that should be used are those whichcorrespond tothe most stable
single phase solid or liquid solution in each binary at the temperature
considered.

Abstract

The thermodynamic fundamentals relating phase relationships
in binary, ternary, and quaternary systems to the thermodynamic
properties of the phases partaking in the equilibria are reviewed
and discussed. Cases considered in detail include partition equi-
libria in ternary and quaternary systems and the role of the three-
phase field in the determination of the relative stabilities of exist-
ing as well as hypothetical phases.

Following a brief discussion of the methods employed in es-
tablishing pertinent phase equilibrium data, the application of the
thermodynamic equations is demonstrated on a number of recently
investigated ternary systems.

Abstract

Solid electrolyte electromotive force cells have been used to
determine the Gibbs free energies, entropies, and enthalpies of
formation of several binary phases of thorium with iron, cobalt,
nickel, or copper. CaF, was employed as the electrolyte, and it is
an ionic conductor over the temperature range of the measurements,
600-850°C. The data indicate a decreasing stability of intermediate
phases with defined stoichiometry, ThxMy, as M changes from nickel
to cobalt to iron. The data further indicate that the Gibbs free
energies of formation per g-atom of thorium are nearly constant for
the thorium-poor phases within a given system. This latter obser-
vation is compatible with crystallographic information which shows
that the near-meighbor atomic coordination around the thorium atoms
in the thorium~poor phases consists exclusively of transition-metal
atoms with the coordination geometries being closely comparable
from phase to phase. The crystallographic data alsc show bond
distances which are compatible with the order of stability with the
greatest relative contraction occurring for thorium-nickel bonds,
intermediate for thorium-cobalt bonds, and least for thorium-iron
bonds.

Introduction

Johnson(l) has surveyed the literature through late 1963 and
has reported that thermodynamic data were then available only for
the thorium-aluminum, thorium~bismuth, thorium-magnesium, thorium-
mercury, and thorium-zinc systems. Additional data have subsequently
become available for the thorium-mercury system(z)as well as data
for the thorium-lead system‘®/. Limited information has also been
found for the thorium-gilicon system(4s5). Since thorium is a
fertile material, thermodynamic data on its metallic systems are
relevant to the design of pyrometallurgical processing metheds for
reactor fuels and blanket materials. The present investigation was
therefore undertaken to add systematically to the needed informatiom.
The series, thorium-iron, thorium-cobalt,. thorium-nickel, and thorium-
copper, wherein the atomic number of the second component increases
by one from one alloy system to the next, was chosen for measure-
ment because the temperature-composition diagrams had already been
reliably determined and because the fifth member of the series,
thorium-zinc, had already been thermodynamically investigated. The
intermediate phases which cccur in these binary systems show definite
crystallographic relationships, and the pattern of occurrence of the
various stoichiometries implies a systematic variation in bonding
interactions.

Procedure & Results

The thorium-iron and thorium-cobalt phase diagrams, as proposed
by Thomson(6), are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The thorium-nickel
phase diagram in Fig. 3 and the thorium-copper phase diagram in
Fig. 4 are reproduced from the compilations of Hansen and Anderko(7)
and of %lgiott(s)r?sFectivel{. The terminal % lubilities of thorium
in iron(6), cobalt(6}, nickel (9} ang copper(®’ are in all cases
and at all temperatures ~2 at. 7 or less. A Raoultian approximation
indicates that within the precision of the present measurements such
limited solubility is of negligible significance. Among the inter-
mediate phases, only ThCos exhibits a range of solid solubility and
then only between 83.5 and 85.0 at. % cobalt(6) at 1100°C; this is
also of negligible significance.

phases in the temperature-composition diagram and can exist in
chemical equilibrium. All phases were solid throughout the experi-

ments. Half cell reactions for these galvanic cells can be written

If the cells are operated feversibly at fixed temperature, EMF values
provide direct measures{10) of the Gibbs free energies of the cell
reactions through the relation

/_\.GT = -4FE
where % is the Faraday constant and E is the open circuit EMF. If
pure solid phases are chosen as standard states and if the limited
solubilities are neglected, the data are directly convertible to
standard free energies of formation.

Oriani(ll) has discussed electrochemical techniques for thermo-
dynamic measurements and has concluded that in reversible cells the
electrolyte must exhibit ionic conductivity only, the electro-
positive metal must have a single, defined valence state with respect
to the anions of the electrolyte, and only one reaction should occur
at each electrode interface. 1In the present experiments the first
criterion is met since the values of both Ure{l2) and Patterson(13)
confirm that solid CaF, is an ionic conductor throughout the temp-
erature range of measurement. With respect to the latter criteria,
the compilation by Hamer, Malmberg, and Rubin{(14)of an electro-
motive force series for sclid and liquid fluorides indicates that,
in the cells in question, CaFj should be unaffected by the cell
reactions, the transition metals should remain in the reduced metal-
lic state, and thorium should exist both as a metal and as a fluoride
with the changes in its state corresponding to the reaction within
the cell. Though there are problems with solid electrolytes,(15a16)
the suitability of the present electrochemical cells is corroborated
by the results of Aronson and coworkers(17,18,19) who have used
similar cells for the determination of the thermodynamics of form-
ation of thorium carbides, borides, and sulfides. Furthermore,
Oriani's review suggests experimental tests for reversibility, since,
in a cell operating reversibly, the EMF should be time independent
at constant temperature, should have the same value irrespective of
whether the temperature has been approached from above or below,
and should recover to the same value after current is passed through
the cell in either direction. During the accumulation of the present
data, any measurement which failed these reversibility criteria was
rejected.

Alloys were prepared from material whose impurity analyses are
shown together with that for ThF, in Table 1. The iron analysis is
the manufacturer's analysis for high-purity electrolytic iron while
the iron which was used in this investigation was a super-purity
grade and should have impurity concentrations lower than those in-
dicated in the Table. The ThF,; was also further purified from that
analyzed for the Table. This purification was achieved by heating
the ThF,; with ammonium bifluoride at 150-180°C for 12 hours and then
slowly heating to 350°C while passing dry air over the fluorides.
This should have reduced any residual oxides or oxyfluorides. The
CaF, which was used for the electrolyte was from Electronic Space
Products Inc. and was quoted as being 99.95% pure.

Alloys were prepared by arc melting the elements in an argon
atmosphere that had been purified by melting zirconium several
times. The arc melted alloys were successively inverted and re-
melted several times to facilitate homogeneity. Alloys that passed
through peritectic transformations on cooling were sealed in tanta-
lum crucibles under a vacuum and equilibrated at 25C° below the
transformation temperature for 10-14 days. Alloys that passed
through eutectic transformations were not similarly heat treated.
Debye-Scherrer powder photographs of all alloys were taken to
verify the presence of only the two equilibrium phases. The thorium-
nickel alloys that passed through a peritectic transformation were
also checked with an electron beam microprobe. In no case were
non~equilibrium phases found.

The alloys were very reactive and were therefore stored in a dry
box containing an argon atmosphere. This reactivity tends to in-
crease with increasing thorium content and the present measurements
were therefore limited to the thorium-poor regions of the alloy
systems. For x-~ray measurements fine powders were prepared and
sealed into x-ray capillary tubes withir the dry box. All steps for
the preparation of electrode pellets were performed in the dry box
except the actual pressing operation. Alloys that were brittle were
crushed with a diamond mertar and those that were not brittle were
filed with a tungsten carbide file. Thorium was filed with an
ordinary file and the filings were then passed through a group of
small magnets to remove any iron introduced by the file. All of the
powders were passed through a 60 mesh screen to remove large part-
icles and 20 wt % ThF, powder was then added. The mixture was
pressed in a one-half inch tungsten carbide die at 30,000 psi. The
resultant electrode pellets were from 2 to 5 mm thick. Electrolyte
pellets were prepared by pressing one-half to two grams of CaFy at
7,500 psi in a one-half inch tungsten carbide die, them hydrostati-
cally pressing the pellets at 50,000 psi, and finally sintering
them in an induction furnace under vacuum at 1000°C for 15 minutes.

A schematic diagram of the experimental apparatus is shown in

between the external circuit and the cell electrodes. Spectro-
scopic analyses showed no evidence of interaction between the
tantalum and cell electrodes. Cell temperatures were controlled

to *1°C. Temperatures were measured with a chromel-~alumel thermo-~
couple, and calibration showed that standard tables could be used to
convert thermocouple EMF's to temperatures without significant
error (<0.1%Z). EMF measurements were made with a Leeds and North-
rup K-3 potentiometer. C(Cells were operated under purified helium
at a positive pressure of two inches of mercury above atmospheric.
Absence of spurious EMF's in the circuitry was verified by making

a dummy run with no electrode pellets between the tantalum contacts.

EMF measurements on various alloy compositions were made over the
temperature range, 850-1120°K. The experimental data are plotted in
Fig. 6 where the linear representations are least-squares fits to
the experimental points. In all cases data were taken from two
independent cells, and in most cases two different alloy compositions
were employed. TFrom these data, standard free energies, enthalpies,
and entropies of phase formation were derived, and values for these
thermodynamic functions at 973°K, which is near the mean of the
temperature range, are listed in Table 2. The quoted uncertainties
are based upon the root mean square deviation of experimental points
from linear relationships.

Discussion

Crystallographic data indicate that ThjNijs crystallizes(zo)
in a double~layered hexagonal structure while ThCoj7 and Th2Feqpy
crystallize(zo’21 in a closely related triple-layered structure
whose prototype is Th2Znj7. The ?hases, ThFes5, ThCo5, and ThNig,
are isostructural and crystallize 20) in the hexagonal structure
whose prototype is CaCus and which is crystallographically also
closely related to the ThPNijy and Th2Zny; type structures. In the
ThoM37 and ThMs5 phases with M being iron, cobalt, or nickel, indi-
vidual thorium atoms are coordinated to either eighteen, nineteen,
or twenty neighboring atoms of the M species with the average
thorium coordination number being eighteen and one-half. For both
the ThyM;7 phases and for the ThM5 phases, the sequence of magnitudes
for the free energies of phase formation is compatible with the
crystallographic data in the sense that the interatomic Th-M bond
distances in the intermediate phases show contractions from the
average of the Th-Th and M-M distances in the parent metals which
are greatest for the thorium-nickel phases, intermediate for the
thorium—-ccbalt phases, and least for the thorium-iron phases. This
statement is valid for the ThMg sequence because even though the
free energy of formation of ThFeg has not yet been measured, the
free energy of formation of ThFey; cannot be more negative than -2.9
kcal/g-atom; otherwise, ThyFe]7 would not be a stable phase and
would spontaneously decompose to ThFeg and iron with a reduction in
total free energy.

It is interesting to note that conversion of the values in Table 2
from kcal/g-atom of compound to kcal/mole of thorium yields values
of -52.2%0.2 for ThoNiyy, -52.220.2 for ThNis5, -30.1#0.4 for ThoCoj7y,
~-30.510.3 for ThCog and ~17.3%#0.4 for ThyFey7. From a quasi-chemical
view the formation of an intermediate phase results from the energy
reduction associated with the bonding of one species to a second
unlike species. On the basis of the closely comparable thorium
environments in the crystallographic structures, it is therefore
not surprising to find closely comparable free energies of formation
per mole of thorium for the two nickel phases and also for the two
cobalt phases. It would seem reasonable that the same situation
should hold true for ThyFei7 and ThFes, and thus a free energy of
formation for ThFeg of -17.3%0.4 kcal/mole of thorium or -2.88£0,07
kcal/g-atom of compound can be considered as a good estimate.

An entropy of formation for ThFegmay also be estimated from the
entropies of formation of the ThpM;7; and ThMg phases in the manner
shown in Fig. 7. There it may be noted that the shift in AS§y3 from
ThNis to ThCos is essentially parallel to the shifts in AS§y3 from
ThyNi;, to ThpCoyy to ThpFej;. A similar shift from ThCos to ThFes
can be used as a basis for estimating a value of -2.5 e.u./g-atom
for the entropy of formation of ThFeg. Combination of the free
energy and entropy estimates for ThFes; indicates that the enthalpy
of formation should be near to -5.3 kcal/g-atom. The reliability
of these entropy and enthalpy values is expected to be less good
than the free energy value by about an order of magnitude.

MOLE FRACTION THORIUM

Free energies of alloy formation as functions of composition for the thorium-iron, thorium-
cobalt, and thorium-nickel systems with experimental data being connected by solid lines and

estimated data being connected by dashed lines
Finally, estimates of the free energies of formation of the
remaining thorium-nickel, thorium-cobalt, and thorium-iron phases
can be made by a simple extension of the quasi-chemical approach.
In this extension the free energies of formation of the Th2Mj; and
ThMs5 phases may be taken as the base, and the free energy of forma-
tion per mole of thorium for any ThxMy phase can then be taken as
lower than that for the ThoMy7 and ThMs5 phases in direct proportion
to the difference in the number of M atoms coordinated about the
thorium atoms. For instance in ThNij, the nickel coordination
around thorium is twelvefold(zo), and thence AG§73 should be
(12/18.5)(-52.2) kcal/mole of thorium which converts to -11.3
kcal/g-atom and is within 14% of the experimental value in Table 2.
Similar testing of the procedure on the thorium-zinc system with
ThpZnjy as the base yielded estimated values for ThZng,, ThZnp, and
ThoZn which averaged ~20% deviation from the experimental values
of Chiotti and Gi11(22), Comparable agreement has also been ob-
tained between estimated values and preliminary experimental values
for ThCo3, ThNi, and ThyNig. Plots of integral free energies of
alloy formation against mole fraction thorium are shown in Fig. 8
for the thorium-nickel, thorium-cobalt, and thorium~iron systems.
The dashed portions of these plots have been estimated in the manner
outlined and, on the basis of the indicated tests of the estimating
procedure, should have a reliability of about *207%.

No similar estimates were made for the thorium-copper system
since the crystal structure of ThCu, is as yet unknown. In this
system stoichiometries of ThjCujy and ThCug do not occur as stable
phases, and, in view of the value of the free energy of formation
of ThCu4,, it is evident that the free energy of formation for ThCujy
must be less negative than -2.3 kcal/g-atom and for ThCus; less nega-~
tive than -3.6 kcal/g-atom.
