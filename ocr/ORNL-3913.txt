LIQUID-LIQUID IMMISCIBILITY
IN THE SYSTEM LiF-BeF -ZiF

H. A. Friedman R. E. Thoma

Beryllium fluoride systems have been of interest
because they provide “‘weakened models™! of Si0,
The weakened model contains cations
and anions of the same radius as those in the
silicate system, but with half the ionic charge. In
MgO-S10,, a liquid immiscibility region is found;
in the weakened model LiF-BeF, this has not been
found, although metastable glasses, mutually in-
soluble, are encountered at 60 to 90 mole % BeF, ,
where the melts are highly viscous. Our recent
work on the Lil-BeF -ZiF system” reveals that
stable liquid-liguid regions do exist in this ternary,
although they do not extend stably to the LiF-Bel
binary.

systems.

Silicate and BeF glagses are structurally anal-
ogous and are composed of networks of bridging
ions, oxide and fluoride ions respectively. Other
cations, particularly the low velent ones, if added
to these glasses, break the bridges and are referred
to as modifiers; their effect on viscosity is quite
pronounced. The possible role of ZrF, as a net-
work modifier or network former has not previously
been examined.

Our liquid-liquid immiscibility studies were made
with a new high-temperature centrifuge that devel-
oped a centrifugal force of 530 x ¢ and gave pood
layer separation in sealed metal capsules. Results

were based on chemical analyses of portions of
quenched samples obtained after 1-hr periods at
elevated temperature in the centrifuge. In pre-
liminary trials with PbO-B O, glasses, good agree-
ment was obtained with the work of Geller and
Bunting.” lsothermal tie lines at 550, 650, and
700°C for the immiscibility region in LiF-Bel, -
ZrF , are shown in Fig. i.1.

The possibility of stable liquid-liquid immis-
cibility in the LiF-BeF, system was given special
attention. This was in part prompted by results on
the chemical activity of BeF, as a function of
composition in the LiF-BeF, binary, as obtained
from HF-H, 0 equilibria,” where there was an
indication that immiscibility might occur for 80
mole % BeF , at temperatures above 700°C.

Ten samples representing six binary composi-
tions in the range from 80 to 34 mcle % Bel, were
centrifuged and examined; no phase separation was
found. Further, visual observations of an 80 mole
% BeF | melt were made under helium in a glove
box and furmace assembly by Cantor and Ward.’
Again the liquid was single phase, although on the
initial heating to 700°C a lower viscous layer and
a thinner, easily stirred, upper layer persisted;
only after heating to 850°C did the melt become
homogeneous. The melt remained homogeneous
through subsequent temperature cycles ifrom room
temperature to 850°C. The conclusion was reached
that there is no stable immiscibility above the
liguidus in the LiF-BeF , hinary.

of the recently completed investigation of the
sodium fluoride—lanthanide trifluoride systems (see
*#Compositional Variability in Sodium Fluoride—
Lanthanide Fluoride Complex Compounds,” this
report), it became evident that within the series
cation charge density was beginning to obscure the
effect of size. It was therefore of great interest to
obtain ioformation concerning the comparative
phase behavior among the following group of sys-
tems, which are ranked below in order of increasing
difference of the tripositive cation to alkali cation
radius ratio:

nearer to Lu®? (0.848) than to A1** (0.45). Similar
to the Nal-AlF , system, molten NaF-ScF  mix-
tures form a cryolite-like phase, 3NaF.Sck
which, like cryolite, is dimorphic. Crystals of each
form are isomorphous with their cryolite analogs.
The phase 3NaF -ScF, undergoes a strongly
exothermal solid-state inversion when cooled below
680°C and inverts to poorly crystallized and highly
twinned material. Single crystals of the low-
temperature form of 3Nal - ScF , were obtained by
growth from NaF-ScF, mixtures of 70-30 mole %
composition. X-ray diffraction analysis of these
single crystals indicated that they are of mono-
clinic symmetry (see “*Crystallographic Data on
New Compounds,*’ this report) and are isomorphous
with cryolite. A high-temperature foem of cryolite
is reported” to occur as a face-centered cubic
phase. Preliminary results of high-temperature
x-ray diffractometric experiments with 3NalF . ScF
indicate that the high-temperature forms of 3Nal -
5c¢F, and 3NaF - AlF | are isomorphous.

Whereas the intermediate phase in the 3Naf -
AlF -AlF , subsystem is of 5:3 composition, only
a 1:1 phase is formed in the 3NaF -ScF -5cF,
subsystem. The compound NaF - 5ck | melts incon-
gruently to ScF, and liquid at 660°C. X-ray dif-
fraction data obtained from single crystals of
NaF - 5¢F, revealed it to be of hexagonal ' sym-
metry (see ““Crystallographic Data on New Com-
pounds,”’ this report).

We believe that the greater resemblance of the
system NaF-SCF3 to NaF-AlF, rather than to
NaF-LuF3 arises as a result of the lanthanide
contraction, producing the Lu®" ion of extra-
ordinarily high charge density. Quantitative rela-
tionships of the combined effects of ion size and
charge density have been developed by Dietzel.1?
They require accurate information of interionic
distances, which for these complex fluorides must
await determination of the crystal structures.

The composition and temperatures of invariant
equilibrium points in the system Na\F-ScF3 are
listed in Table 1.1,

Investigation of the sodium fluoride—~lanthanide

salient feature of the NaF-LnF , binary systems
is the unusual behavioral sequence produced by
the compositional variability of the fluorite-like
phases. This behavior shows the remarkable effect
of cation size and polarizability in lanthanide
systems. As shown in Table 1.2, the cubic phase
is not formed at all in the systems NaF-LaF and

NaF~CeF3, is formed by Nal' and PrFS, and is
extended to an increasingly broad composition
range throughout the rest of the system sequence.
A trend also develops toward broadening the com-
position limits and extension of the temperature
range through which the cubic and orthorhombic
phases are stable. The trends toward increasing
number, compositional variability, and stability of
the NaF-LnF, crystal phases appear to be dis-
tinct, not only with respect to the crystal chem-
istry of the complex compounds, but also in their
modes of crystallization. No satisfactory theory
has as yet been developed to explain the quanti-
tative aspects of compositional variability of
NaF-Lnk , phases. Qualitatively, the trends are
believed to indicate an increase in the lattice
energies of the crystalline phases resulting from
the lanthanide contraction and a corresponding
decrease in polarizability. The decrease in polar-
izability is probably the most influential factor in
enabling compositional variability of the phases to
be extended with increasing atomic number of the
lanthanide. As represented by the Lorentz-Lorenz
equation, molar refraction approximates the volume
occupied by the constituent ions in crystalline
phases. A measure of the crystal free space can
therefore be estimated from the difference between
molar volume, as computed from unit-cell dimen-
sions, and the molar refraction. As the atomic
number increases, small increases in the free
space fraction are noted for the lanthanide tri-
fluorides and for the hexagonal NaF - LnF , phases.
A more pronounced increase in free space fraction
is found for the fluorite-like NaF-LnF3 phases,

with an even greater increase in the free space
fraction for the equimolar cubic phases than for the
cubic SNaF :9LnF , phases as Z increases. Sub-
stitutional solid solution of Ln®" into the fluorite
unit cell gives rise to cation vacancies but is
partly compensated by filling of interstitial posi-
tions with fluoride ions, as described by Roy and
Roy.!?  The fact that the free space fraction
occupied by the ions in the cubic structure at the
S5NaF - 9LnF3 saturation limit is even greater than
composition lends additional
evidence to the validity of the previous interstitial
fluorine model for solution mechanism.

We conclude that the combined effect of the
reduction in polarizability of the lanthanide ions
and the increase in free space within the crystal
lattice is to reduce the specificity of Na® and
Ln®"' ions with regard to the cation sites they
occupy in fluorite-like, orthorhombic, and hexagonal

increase observed in compositional variability of
the crystal phases in the NaF-LnF , systems with
increasing atomic number of the lanthanide.

Equilibrations of the oxides with fluoride melts

1150°C. The oxide solids from these latter equil-
ibrations were not only examined by x-ray and
petrographic techniques as before, but also these
and all of the previously equilibrated solids have
been chemically analyzed io determine the U-Zr
composition of the individual phases. (The separa-
tion of the phases was performed using hot nitric
acid, a liquid in which UO, is readily soluble and
Zr0O, is virtually insoluble.)

Mumpton and Roy?® as 1170°C. No attempt was
made to determine this inversion temperature in
the present work. However, microscopic investiga-
tion of a sample of pure ZrO, equilibrated at
1190°C has shown that it definitely had been
tetragonal. Hence, the Mumpton and Roy value of
1170°C falls within our limits of 1110 to 1190°C.

Below the transition temperature of 1110°C, the
saturating solids are the cubic UQ,-rich and the
monoclinic ZrO _-rich solid solutions. However,
even at 1110°C, these solid solutions are very
dilute.

Moreover, it is expected that the solubil-

We believe the differences in the results reported
here and those reported previously by others
reflect the inability of the other investigators to
obtain equilibrinm products at temperatures below
1600°C solely via solid-state reactions. These
temperatures are more than a thousand degrees
below the melting points of the pure oxides. At
such temperatures, solid-state
reactions of the oxides should be very slow. In
the present investigation the use of a fused fluo-
ride phase provided a path by which the slowness
of the solid-state reaction could be overcome and
equilibrium could be achieved.

THE CRYSTAL STRUCTURE
OF LiUF,

G. ID. Brunton

The compound LiUF_ was originally described

as Li,{,U6F31 in the molten-salt

system Lik-
UF4.22"25 The crystal structure was determined
in order to resolve the stoichiometry and because
LiUF _ is the uranium salt which would be deposited
if fue! should freeze in the Molten-Salt Reactor
Experiment.

Tetragonal LilJE crystallizes in space group
I41/a with a = 14.884 + 0.002 A and ¢ = 6.5467 +
0.0003 A. The calculated density is 6.23 g/cc
with 16 formula weights per unit cell,
parameters are listed in Table 1.3.

Atomic

Figure 1.4 is an illustration of two asymmetric
units of LiUF | related by a center of symmetiy —
approximately one-eighth of a uunit cell.
1.5 is a stereoscopic pair showing the contents
of one unit cell.

Figure

Each uranium is surrounded by
nine ftluorine ions which form the corners of a
14-faced polyhedron having the form of a prism
with triangular bases and with a four-faced pyramid
on each of the three prism faces. Each lithium
ion is surrounded by six fluorine ions at the corners
of a distorted octahedron.

The structure of LiUF . consists of 16 uranium-
containing polyhedra and 16 lithium-containing
octahedra linked together so that every uranium
polyhedron shares an end with its centrosym-
metrical neighbor, shares corners with five other
uranium polyhedra, and shares a face, an edge,
and two corners, respectively, with four lithium
octahedra. Each lithium octahedron shares edges
with three other lithium octahedra, and shares
an edge, a face, and two corners, respectively,
with four uranium polyhedra. This linkage gives
spiraling cross-connected chains parallel to the
C axis.

indicated that LisAlFﬁ, NaSAlFé, and K3A1F‘6
are each components of these systems; and while
the latter two were known to have the cryolite
structure, LiSAIF() had not been studied. The
existence of sixfold and twelvefold coordination
for the alkali-metal ions in cryolite was not ex-
pected to hold for Li*, and indeed a new structure
type was found.

Crystals of L13A1F6 were prepared by melting
together under vacuum a 3:1 mixture of LiF and
AlF .. Some of the compound distilled to a cold
finger in the vessel, but the larger crystals were
obtained from the residue in the bottom. Powder
x-ray diffraction examination showed both to be
virtually the same phases, with a little excess
AlF , on the cold finger,

X-ray precession photographs were used to
establish that the crystals were otthorhombic with
unit-cell dimensions: a = 9.54, b = 8.23, ¢ = 4.88
(£0.02 A). Systematically absent reflections: hOf,
L = 2n, and 0k, k + | = 2n, indicated the probable
space groups Pama and Pna? .» which differ by the
presence of a center of symmetry. The density,
calculated with four formula weights in the unit
cell, is 2.80 g/cm?®. The density was measured
to be between 2.6 and 3.0 by flotation in heavy
liquids. |

Intensity data for determination of atomic posi-
tions was obtained by photographing Akl zones,

with I =0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, employing the multiple-
{ilm Weissenberg technique. The intensities of
the reflections were estimated by comparison with
calibrated film strips. Some 238 independent
reflections were measured and their intensities
reduced to structure factors, F .

The Patterson vector method was applied to
locate the Al and F atoms, and calculation of a
difference Fourier map then was successful in
determining the Li positions. All atoms of the
structure occupy fourfold general sites of space

REFINEMENT OF THE CRYSTAL
STRUCTURE OF (NH ) ,MnF,

D. R. Sears

The manganic ion is unstable with respect to
disproportionation, and as a consequence, simple
salts of trivalent manganese are rare. Neverthe-
less, it is desirable to collect definitive informa-
tion on the structures of manganic salts when
possible, for complex anions containing trivalent
manganese can be expected to exhibit significant
crystal field effects. In particular, octahedrally

14

coordinated Mn>" should be tetragonally distorted
as a result of the Jahn-Teller effect.?8

The compound (NH ) MnF _ crystallizes in the
centrosymmetric orthorhombic space group D;:-
Pnma, with a = 6.20 = 0.03, b = 7.94 + (.01, and
c = 10.72 £ 0.01 A.
spectrometric zonal =x-ray intensity data were
collected in 1957 from specimens of (NH,),MnF _
prepared by T. S. Piper. The data had resulted in
a structure determination,?® but it had not been
possible to perform a satisfactory refinement with
the computing facilities available then. The
opportunity arose to perform a modern full matrix
least-squares with the

existing AOI and Ok! intensity data, using a modifi-
cation of the Busing-Martin-Levy program ORFLS.??
Anomalous dispersion effects were included in the
calculations.

Final least-squares-adjusted atomic positions
and thermal parameters resulted in an agreement

atoms are shown in Fig. 1.7. Each octahedron has

 

the composition MnF , with manganese occupying
the center and fluorines the vertices. Ammonium
groups appear as stippled spheres and form infinite
hexagonal nets in mirror planes at y - 1/;, ?‘,;_ In-
finite kinked chains of MnF  octahedra, sharing
opposite vertices, pass through these ammonium
nets. The manganese atoms lie on symmetry
centers, and consequently there are but three
crystallographically distinct fluorines.

Bond distances and angles are presented in
Table 1.5. In this table, £ is the fluorine atom

between adjacent fluorines in the octahedra were
in the range 2.59 to 2.84 A. Although nitrogen-

strongly that N-H-I' hydrogen boonding is abszent

The bond distasces and angles involving man-
ganese reveal that there iz indeed a pronounced
tetragonal disiortion of the octahedral manganese
coordination shell. Doubtless, sharing of the F
atoms between adiacent octahedra contributes to
the substaniiel elongation of the Mn-F_bonds, but
a Jahn-Teller digtortion must contribute signifi-
cantly. However, quontitative separation of

such a disftortion in aqueous MnF63” solutions
surely cannot result from chain formation. We
infer that the distortion arises largely from ligand
field effects in solution and, by extension, does
so also in the crystal.

in several studies of phase change at elevated
temperatures, with the following resulis.

The orthorhombic lanthanide trifluorides SmF

a phase transition below their melting points.® Of
these compounds, SmF . through HoF , invert to
the hexagonal LaF , structure while YF , and ErF,

Phase equilibrium studies in the UO -ZiO,
system have been continued, the principal objects
being: (1) to investigate the composition-tempera-
ture region in which Thoma®! has postulated the
existence of a compound of approximate composi-
tion UO 3Zr02, (2) to furnish x-ray diffraction
data for the continuing fluoride-flux c‘qulhbratmn
experiments of Romberger, Stone, and Baes;*?
and (3) to develop
constant—composition relationships for the sys-
tem UO, (cubic)-ZrO (cubic).

Tentative results to date suggest that the sys-
tem cubic UOzwcubic Zi0, at room temperature
displays a linear relationship between a  and
mole fraction Z10,, at least to 50% Z10,. The
data can be extrapolated to a, = 5.08 A at 100%
ZtO,, in reasonable agreement with the results
obtained by extrapolation of the CeO,-Zr0O, data
(5.11 A) due to Duwez and Odell.??

Attempts to establish the existence of a compound
of composition near UO,k -3Z:0, above 1600°C
have not been successful. We have not obtained
pure tetragonal starting material near this mole
ratio. X-ray diffraction experiments in the temper-
ature range 1400 to 1650°C at a ZrO,:UO, ratio
of 1.36, using a pure tetragonal solid-solution
starting material, have resulted in exsolution, to
form nearly pure cubic UO, and tetragonal ZrO -
UQ, solid solution richer in Z10 .

Our high-temperature diffractonieter attachment
is being modified extensively to permit operation
at higher temperatures in better vacuum and to
diminish problems in window opacity caused by

prerequisite  for proceeding with the structure
determination. Of these compounds, Na ScF
was found to be of the cryolite type (N33A1F6),

OXIDE CHEMISTRY OF LiF-BeF -ZrF , MELTS

In previously reported studies of the oxide

their role in the contamination of molten fluorides
with oxide, their role in the removal of oxides by
HF during salt purification, and, more recently,
because of their use in oxide analysis.® Reaction
(3) has been of interest because it relates the

However, these estimates have been of limited
accuracy because of the difficulties in determin-
ing QO by the transpiration method,

During the past year, a more direct method for
determining oxide solubilities has been adopted.
A measured volume of salt, presaturated by
equilibration with excess solid oxide, is filtered
through a sintered nickel filter into a heated re-
ceiving vessel, It is then sparged with an H -HF
mixture and the total amount of water evolved
determined by Karl-Fischer titration, Thus far,
essentially complete removal of oxide from the
filtered salt samples has been accomplished in
3 hr or less by use of an influent HF pressure of
0.05 atm. The blank has been equivalent to
~2 x 1072 mole/kg of oxide (32 ppm), the sensi-
tivity has been ~.5 x 107 * mole/kg (8 ppm), while
the experimental values ranged from 1.5 x 1072 to
1.5 x 107 * mole/kg.

This method presently is being used to redeter=-
miie the solubilities of ZrO_ in (2LiF-BeF2) +
ZrE  mixtures, which simulate MSRE fuel salt and
flush salt mixtures. The results obtained thus far
are compared in Fig. 2.1 with previously reported’
estimates based on measured values of the ratio
(_)O/Qzr in such salt mixtures. When completed,
these measurements should permit the establishe
ment of more reliable tolerance limits for oxide

levels in the MSRE and in future molten-salt
reactors. In addition, the more accurate solubility
values - when combined with er values [reaction

(3)] — should yield cortespondingly more reliable
values of ¢ . These will be useful in optimizing
oxide removal procedures during salt purification
and salt analysis,

provided adequate fit to the data (4 and B are
constants). The data are summarized in Table
2.3, The constants for each equation were obe
tained by the method of least squares, Isotherms
at 1000 and 1100°C are shown in Fig, 2.3.

To obtain some unotion of the vapor species,
vapor was collected in the tubes of the vessel at
the conclusion of vapor pressure measurements
for several compositions. Chemical analysis
showed only traces of lithium ion in condensates
where the composition of the melt was 75 or
greater mole % Ber. For melts with 70 or less
mole % BeF , considerable quantities of lithium
were found in the condensates. All that may be
concluded from these analyses is (1) at greatet
than 75 mole % BeF,, the vapor is virtually pure
BEFZ, and (2) at less than 70 mole % Bel’*‘z, the
vapor becomes more complicated; the vapor prob-

ably contains the compounds LiBeF, and

LiQBeF,‘,zo The only activity coefficients that
may be calculated from these data alone are those
of Be¥ at melt concentrations of 75 mole % or
greater in Ber. For these concentrations the
activity coefficients of BeF  at temperatures of
1000 and 1100°C were found to be greater than
unity {varying between 1.02 and 1.10), These
values of the activity coefficient are in reasone
able accord with results of the H, 0-HF equilibrae
tion studies?? of the LlF—BeFZ system,

Manometric vapor pressures were also measured
for the MSRE fuel solvent (composition: 64.7~
30.1-5.2 mole % LiFmBeFZ-Zerr) in the tempera-
ture range 960 to 1167°C. The data fit the equa-
tion log p(mm) = 8,803 - 9936/T(°K).

YISCOSITIES OF MOLTEN FLUORIDES

3. Cantor W, T. Ward

Li!':--BeF’2

Viscosity measurements of the LiF-BeF sys-
tem were extended to include three more mixtures
(36, 40, and 45 mole % BeF ). The viscosity of
pure BeF  was measured again, this time over a
410° temperature range. As previously reported,??
all measurements were carried out with the Brook-
field LLVT viscometer,

For the three mixtures, viscosity decreased with
decreasing Ber concentration. The degree of
decrease with concentration, however, was not
very large; below 50 mole % BeF  concentration,
melts are more typically ionic with relatively low
vizcosilies; the clusters of beryllium-fluorine
linkages that accounted for the very high viscos-
ities at higher BeF, concentrations are greatly
diminished when the concentration of BeF  is less
than 50 mole %.

The viscosity of pure BeF, was remeasured
to determine if pronounced deviation from Arrhenijus
behavior occurs. The plot of log n vs 1/T showed
only slight curvature; hence, BeF, is Arrhenius.
Usually the physical behavior of BeF  is analogous
to that of Si0_. Macedo and Litovitz?® postulated
that the Arrhenius behavior of 5i0, is due to the
constancy of density with temperature which, in
turn, means that the free volume of 510 , does not
change with temperature. To establish that den-
sity constancy with temperature is also why Bel
is Arrthenius will be difficult, because density
measurements of Bel”_  are a difficult experimental
task; nevertheless, we are currently considering
methods for measuring the density of pure BeF .

The data on the LiF-BeFZ system are summarized
in Table 2.4, The constants for the viscosity-
temperature equations were obtained by the method
of least squares.

liminary measurements were begun to determine
the viscosities of fluoroborates. The first measure=
ments were made on NaBF ; the results were:
7 + 2 centipoises at 466°C and 14 1 3 centipoises
at 436°C. The precision is poor because the
Brookfield viscometer is primarily designed to
measure higher viscosities,

No mixtures of alkali fluorides with NaBF | were
measured because such melts would most likely
have been even less viscous than pure NaBF ;
the poor precision in this lower viscosity range
discouraged us from attempting further measure-
ments with the instrumentation at hand.

ESTIMATING DENSITIES OF MOLTEN
FLUORIDE MIXTURES

S, Cantor

Several vears ago,2® the author, after examining
the published data on density of molten fluorides,
proposed that the simple rule of additivity of
molar volumes was very useful for estimating
densities of fluoride meits., To facilitate calcula-
tions, a table of empirical molar volumes was
derived from the published data. Since the earlier
report, there have been several experimental
studies of densities of fluoride melts. In this
repott, we reexamine the previous method of esti-
mation taking into account the newer measurements.

First, it appears that the rule of additivity of mo-
lar volumes held for all binary fluoride systems
except one; the one exception was the NaF-UF
system,?’ where positive deviations from addi-
tivity were as great as 6%; the rule held in two
studies of the L.iI*"»’I‘hF4 system?®:*? and in the
LiF-UF,,”® NaF-ThF,,*® and LiF-KF’? systems.

It was also found that the measured densities?®

NaF-LiF, NaF-LiF-CaF , and KF-NaF-LiF sys-
tems were all within 1% of densities estimated
by the additivity rule (using the molar volumes
given in Table 2.5). Two ternary systems,
NaF-LiF-ZrF43° and  KF-LiF-ZrtF ,?°  both
studied by the same investigators and by the
same method, were each consistently additive in
molar volumes. However, the molar volume of
ZrF4 that fits one system did not fit the other

cutectic, the molar volume was 45 cm’). For
density measurements carried out by Sturm®! on
four fluoride mixtures, the additivity estimate
differed from the experimental results by 5 to 6%
for three mixtures; the discrepancy between ex-
perimental and estimated density of fluoride mix-
tures seldom exceeds 3%. Although errors in the
molar volumes of 'E-L"rl:‘4 and KF may be responsible,
the reasons for these larger discrepancies are as
yet unresolved.

Thus, it appears that, although there may be
exceptions, the rule of additive molar volumes
describes the experimental data on molten fluorides
quite well and remains the simplest, most accurate
method for estimating densities of fluoride melts.

Table 2.5 gives a revised and enlarged set of
empirical molar volumes. The molar volumes of
AlF, were derived from the studies of Edwards
et al.®? on cryolite. Molar volumes of the alkaline-
earth fluorides (other than Ber), YFS, and the
rare-earth fluorides are based on measurements. of

tained from Yaffe’s measurements.®® The molar

ESTIMATING SPECIFIC HEATS AND THERMAL
CONDUCTIVITIES OF FUSED FLUORIDES

8. Cantor

Specific Heats

The simplest rule for estimating high-tempera-
ture heat capacities in the condensed states is
that of Dulong and Petit, in which the heat
capacity per grameatom is approximately equal to
30

6 cal/°K. Accordingly, the experimental heat
capacities of molten fluorides were examined in
order to modify the Dulonge«Petit value for molten
fluorides. The data for pure compounds (see Table
2.6) indicate that the heat capacity per gram-atom
is approximately 8 cal/°K. The data for fluoride
mixtures would seem to indicate the average value
to be somewhat higher than 8, However, the heat
capacities of the mixtures are probably uncertain
by 10 to 20%, whereas the experimental uncertainty
for most of the pure compounds is less than 5%.
Hence, 8 cal (°K)™! (gram-atom)™ ! is the value
chosen for estimating specific heats of fluoride
melts,

The temperature variation of C_ in liquids, when
determined accurately, is very small; whether this
variation is negative or positive has not been
adequately established. It is, therefore, prudent
to assume that C is temperature independent.

[The specific heat is estimated from the follow~
ing expression:

8Y (Wp)
cm T (12)

where ¢ is the specific heat, p. is the number of
atoms in a molecule of component 7, and Ni and
Mi are the mole fraction and the molecular weight,
respectively, of component 1,

Thermol Conductivities
At present, accurate measurement of thermal
conductivities of fused fluorides is very difficult;
hence, reliable methods for estimating thermal
conductivities are extremely useful, especially if

one wishes to predict heat transfer rates in

circulating systems. Gambill?® has published an
empirical method for estimating thermal conductivi-
ties which agrees with the available data. This
report will describe a new semitheorefical method
based on Bridgman’s theoty of energy transport
in liquids.*®

Bridgman proposed that energy is transferred by
collision from one molecular layer to the next at
a rate equal to the local sonic velocity and that
the distance traveled between collisions is equal
to some characteristic molecular distance, DBridg-
man obtained the equation for A, the thermal con-
ductivity,

A, (13)

where k is Boltzmann’s constant, g is the velocity
of sound, and A is characteristic molecular dis
tance between collisions, To evaluate A, Bridg-
man substituted the average distance between
molecular centers, (V/N)!/3 (V is the molar
volume and ¥ is Avogadro’s number), thus deriving

the expression
A= 3k N) v
= V "J_ .

Equation (14) is in good agreement with the ex=
perimental data on covalent compounds.

(14)

However,
this equation predicts low thermal conductivities
for molten fluorides because the characteristic
collision distance is too large. The collision
distance for molten salts should be less because
the ions (the ‘“‘molecular’’ entities in the liquid)
are much less compressible than covalent mole~
cules, Rather than attempt to estimate collision
distances in fused salts a priori,*! Eq. (14) was
empirically adjusted to fit the available data, the
equation obtained being:

A 4431<<N)2/3
= (4.4) v o

either the molecular free velume or the compressibility.

The solubilities of HF and DF in the molten
mixture LiF»BeF2 (66-34 mole %) were determined
the temperature range 500 to 700°C and
at gas saturation pressures between 1 and 2 atm.
An extrapolafion of the solubility values provides
an approximation of the solubility of tritium
fluoride in the molten fluoride mixture., The be-
havior of tritium fluoride, formed by neutron irradize-

tion of lithium, in the fluoride mixture would be of
interest in the molten-salt reactor concept as well

blanket for a thermonuclear reactor.*?

The experimental procedure has been previously
described and employed for systematic studies of
gas solubilities in molten fluoride miztures.*?
Anhydrous hydrogen fluoride was obtained from a

Development of an in-pile molten-salt irradiation
assembly! to provide supporting information for
an understanding of both short-term and long-term
effects of irradiation and fissioning on fuels and
materials for molten-salt reactors has continued
during the past year. The irradiation experi-
ments are to be conducted in beam hole HN-1
of the ORR, and it is anticipated that in-pile
operation of the first experiment will begin in
the middle of calendar year 1966.

An autoclave-type (capsule) experiment with
thermally induced salt flow has been designed,
and some 4500 hr of operation have been accu-
mulated in mockup tests with two prototype as-
semblies. Test operation has been at a nominal
salt temperature of 1200°F with a salt mixture
whose composition is LiF-BeF -ZtF -UF, (65-
29-5.1 mole %, liquidus temperature ™~ 840°F).
Salt circulation rates of ~10 c¢cm®/min are achieved
by maintaining a median temperature gradient
of 100 to 180°F between the autoclave and the
cold leg. The flow rate is monitored by heat
balance measurements around the cold leg.

Results of these mockup tests indicate that
the present design of the autoclave is suitable
for use in a molten-salt irradiation program with
the irradiation objectives of (1) 200 w/cm? fuel
fission power and (2) up to 50% 23°U burnup and
long-term in-pile operation.

Earlier models of the autoclave had a horizontal
return line connecting the cold leg with the main
autoclave.? Test operation with helium cover gas
revealed that gas buildup occurred in this return
tine and caused a loss of salt flow after about
16 hr. Flow recovery after evacuation and re-
pressurization but
since continuous salt flow in the experiment is
gsirable, the autoclave was redesigned to elim-
inate the horizontal return line (Fig. 3.1). The
prototype model was modified by removing all
but about 1 in. of the 5-in.-long horizontal line.
This modification increased the operating time

was invariably successful,

without loss of flow to several hundred hours.
Complete elimination the horizontal return
line in the autoclave assembly to be operated
in-pile is expected to correct the flow loss from
gas accumulation. However, test operation of
the first in-pile experiment will be carried out
in the mockup facility to demonstrate satisfactory

of

performance prior to in-pile operation.

Experiment facilities associated with beam hole

molten-salt experiment. Instrument and control

rosion test loops,® are being revised for the
higher operating temperatures and lower pressure

EVAPORATIVE-DISTILLATION STUDIES
ON MOLTEN-S3ALT FUEL COMPONENTS

M. J. Kelly

Vacuum distillation separation of molten-salt
fuel or fuel components from the rare-earth fission

products is an attractive method of decreasing
neutron losses by capture.  To design process
equipment for this task, both the mass rate of
distillation and the relative volatility of the rare
earths must be known for the particular salt
system used. Completed experiments concermn
the planned process demonstration for MSRE
fuel but are also directly applicable to any pro-
posed thermal MSBR fuel.

For MSRE fuel, removal of the uranium by fluo-
rination is proposed. The fuel solvent and re-
maining fission products would then be fed at
the distillation rate to a wvacuum still charped
with LiF-BeF -ZiFF, at that composition which
will yield the fuel solvent as distilled product;
the rare-earth fission products would concentrate
in the still. The residue would be discarded or
processed when necessitated by heat from the
fission products or by carry over of rare earths.
A 10-ml graphite cylinder, containing ~17 g
of salt with a free surface (when molten) of 1
cm?, was used for the still pot. This cylinder
fitted in a “[1’’ shaped INOR-8 tube heated elec-
trically to a given temperature as measured by
four thermocouples in the graphite cylinder. When
the desired temperature was reached, distillation
wasg initiated by evacuating the assembly. Vapor-
ized salt then passed up and over the top of
the *“N1’? with a small portion (attributed to thermal
reflux) collecting at the base of the graphite
cylinder. The product salt condensed in a cooler
(~450°C) collecting cup in the opposite leg.
Distillation was stopped by helium addition after
preselected time periods.

Mass-rate data for ‘Lil® were determined first,
and then MSRE solvent was added to the 7LiF
and distilled in aliquot portions from it. Each
repetition brought the BeF,  and ZrF, conceu-
trations in the pot closer to those which would
yield fuel solvent (LiF-BelF -Zr¥ ; 65-30-5 mole
%) as product. After the equilibrium concentra-
tion was approached, 2200 ppm of neodymium
(as NdF ) was added to the still bottom and
several distillate Then
the neodymium concentration was raised to 22,000
ppm, and the sequence was repeated. For both

samples were taken.

EFFECTIVE ACTIVITY COEFFICIENTS

BY EVAPORATIVE DISTILLATION
OF MOLTEN SALTS

M. J. Kelly

Evaporation into a vacuum from a quiescent
molten-salt mixture of low vapor pressure should
not permit wvapor-liquid equilibrium at the sur-
face of the melt; transport from the surface should
be controlled by the evaporation rates of the
individual components.  The amount vaporized
is a function of the equilibrium vapor pressure,
molecular mass, temperature, and surface area;

Although internal consistency exists, the valnes
are dependent upon vapor-pressure data for the
pure components. Calculations were made using
the values (P°) for the pure components shown
in Table 3.2.8—1°

The least-precise measurements are from MSRE-
solvent distillations; these are included to sub-
stantiate the surmise that, when 2‘,'rF4 is included
in the melt, it effectively removes LiF from the
solvent, The 1000°C LiF-BeF, line has been
extended to 100 mole % LiF since the initial
LiF-BeF -ZrF, experiment contained <0.35 mole
% ZrF,, a quantity so small that the system
can he assumed to be LiF-BeF . On the other
hand, as ZrF, builds up in the mixed system
(to approximately 3 mole %), enhancement of
the Bel activity is noted; this is consistent
with results from MSRE solvent (LiF-BeF ,~LrF
65-30-5 mole % initially). The temperature% re-
ported are those of the bulk melt, and it is rec-
ognized that the surface temperature may be
significantly lower, causing an indeterminate (for
the present) error. Both surface-temperature
effects and the pure LiF-ZrF system are being
studied., It is interesting to note that the as-
sumption of unit activity coeffictent for LiF doeg
not lead to incompatibility with the data of others.

The experiments were performed in all-nickel
vessels which did not react with HI in the pres-
ence of H, at the temperatures studied (474 to
635°C). Such reaction was avoided at the lower
temperatures of the gas exit system by use of
gold-lined nickel and Teflon tubing. The iodine
was added initially as Nal; tests were made of
the effluent gas, and HI, but no elemental io-
dine, was found. The HI was trapped in an
Nz«OH scrubbing solution and determined by stand-
ard iodometric methods. Only about 80% of the
initially added iodide appeared in the NaOH scrub-
ber; it is believed that the remaining iodide
escaped as a result of adsorption of HI on par-
ticulate matter which was not effectively trapped
by the scrubber. When radicactive iodine was

used in tracer experiments and a filter was
placed in the effluent gas stream just down-
stream of the reaction vessel, all the iodine

passing the filter was caught in the NaOH scrub-
ber soclution and appeared as iodide ion. The
discrepancy in material balance will be iovesti-
gated further, but it does not seem likely that
the present estimates of @ for the reaction will
be substantially altered.

Results were consistent with the following in-
tegrated rate equation which may be derived from
reaction (b):

tient, @, for reaction (6). The value of ¢ so
obtained was found not to be significantly de-
pendent on the HF flow rate (0.35 to 1.57 milli-
moles min™?! kg™!'), on the partial pressure of
HF (0.02 to 0.1 atm), ot on the initial iodide
concentration (0.004 to 0.04 mole/kg).  This
indicated that reaction (0) was indeed the only
one of significance, that eguilibrium sparging

REMOVAL OF PROTACTINIUM FROM MOLTEN
FLUORIDES BY OXIDE PRECIPITATION

J. H. Shaffer
. A. Doss

W. K. E. Finnell
W. P, Teichert
W. R. Grimes

Since a single-region molten-salt breeder reactor
would incorporate the fertile material in the reac-
tor fuel mixture, chemical reprocessing schemes
for recovering 23U could be made more effective
if “%Pa, its precursor, could be removed with-
alteration of the relatively large uranium
concentration in the fuel mixiure. The precipi-
tation of an oxide of protactinium by the delib-
erate addition of oxide ion may provide the basis
for such a reprocessing method if the simultane-
ous precipitation of UO, can be avoided. Previ-
ous studies have demonbtratﬂd the chemical
feasibility of oxide precipitation for removing
protactinium from a flucride mixture, LiF-BeF -
ThF4 (67-18-15 mole %), proposed as the blanket
of a two-region molten-salt breeder reactor.!?

In the fluoride fue! mixture of the MSRE, sui-
ficient ZrF, has been added to accommodate
gross oxide contamination without loss of uranium
from solution as UO,_. Earlier studies had dem-
onstrated that UC, would not precipitate at 700°C
from the solvent, LlF Bel', (66-34 mole %) with
added UF, and ZcF , unhl the concentration
ratio of ZtF, to UF, dropped below about 1.5.'°
Therefore, a preliminary study was made ot the
precipitation of PaO, from a fluoride mixture
known to have Zr0, as the stable oxide phase.!®

The f{luoride mixture consisted of LiF-BeF
(66-34 mole %) with added Z:F, equivalent to
0.5 mele of zirconium per kilogram of salt mix-
ture. About 1 mc of **°Pa was included in the
salt prepatation as irradiated ThO_. The mix-
ture was pretreated with anhydrous HF and H,
to convert oxides to fluorides. )

The deliberate introduction of sclid-phase oxide
to the melt was made by adding Zr0O, in small
increments. Filtered samples of the salt mix-
ture were taken at assumed equilibrium condi-

The effective recovery of ?23Pa from a molten-
salt breeder reactor will provide more economic
production of fissionable #33U by substantially
reducing blanket inventory and equipment costs
and by improving neutron utilization. Accord-
ingly, chemical development efforts supporting
the reference-design MSBR are concerned with
the removal of protactinium from the blanket mix-
ture, LiF—BeFZ-ThF’4 (73-2-25 mole %), by methods
which can be feasibly adapted as chemical proc-
esses. An experimental program has been ini-
tiated to study the reduction of protactinium
fluorides from this salt mixture by molten lead
or bismuth saturated with thortum metal at about
400°C. It was hoped that protactinium, as Pak
in the salt phase, would be reduced to its metal-
lic state by thorium metal and could he recovered
in the molten lead or bismuth.

The primary objective of initial experiments
with this program has been the study of protactin-
ium removal from the salt phase of the extraction

ties. The metal-phase extractant, lead or bis-
muth with added thorium metal, was prepared in
the extraction vessel {304l stainless steel
with a low-carbon steel liner) by treatment with
H, at 600°C. 'The extraction experiments were
started by transferring a known gquantity of the
prepared salt mixture into the extraction vessgel
containing the metal-phase extractant. Filtered
samples of the salt phase were taken periodically
for radiochemical analysis of dissolved protac-
tinium. In each experiment, ?3°Pa was rapidly
removed from the salt phase and remained absent
from the solution during the approximately 100
ht at 600°C while tests were made. Subsequent
hydrofluorination of the extraction system with
an HF-H, mixture (1:20 volume ratic) showed
that “%3Pa could be rapidly and almost quanti-
tatively returned to solution in the salt phase.

Typical results of these experiments are shown
in Fig. 3.7. In this experiment thorium metal
was added after the salt mixture was introduced
into the extraction vessel in order to demonstrate
the necessity of the reduction teaction.

SOLUBILITY OF THORIUM IN MOLTEN LE.AB

F. A. Doss

W. K. K. Finnell
W. P. Teichert

Current studies of the removal of protactinium
from a molten fluoride mixture, which simulates
the blanket of the reference design MSBR, have
been directed toward the development of a liquid-
liquid extraction process. The method proposes
that protactinium, as PaF, in a salt phase, can
be reduced to its metallic state and extracted
into a molten-metal phase. The possible use
of a molten mixture of thorium in lead would
provide a convenient method for combining: the
reducing agent with the metal-phase extractant
and for replenishing thorium to the fluoride blanket
mixture. The objective of this study has been
to establish the solubility of thorium in lead
over the temperature range of interest tc this
program and to provide a lead-thorium solution
of known composition for subsequent protactin-
ium-exfraction experiments. :

The experimental mixture, contained in low-
carbon steel, consisted of approximately 3 kg
of lead and 100 g of thorium-metal chips. Values
for the solubility of thorinm were obtained by
analyses of filtered samples withdrawn from the
melt at selected temperatures over the interval
400 to 600°C under assumed equilibrium condi-
tions. Samples wete withdrawn during two heat-
ing and coeling cycles and submitted for acti-
vation and spectrographic analyses. These re-
sults, plotted as the logarithm of the solubility
vs the reciprocal of the absolute temperature
in Fig. 3.8, indicate that the heat of solution
of thorium in lead is approximately 19 kcal/mole
and that its solubility at 606°C is about 1.85 x
104 m.f.

PROTACTINIUM STUDIES IN THE HIGH-ALPHA
MOLTEN-SALT LABORATORY

C. J. Barton

The Reactor Chemistiy Division has, for the
past few lacked facilities for research
with significant quantities of alpha-active mate-
rials 23%py and ?®*'Pa. Interest in
using the latter isotope as a stand-in for the
more radicactive 23%Pa led to construction of
the High-Alpha Molten-Salt Laboratory which is
shown in Fig. 3.9. Seven interconnected glove
boxes are presently installed in the laboratory,
and one end of the train is connected to a glove-
equipped hood. The glove boxes are maintained
at a negative pressure with respect to the labora-
tory by an and the
room is at a negative pressure with respect to
the surrounding area. The glove-box exit air
is doubly filtered, and all air exhausted from
the room discharges through the plant central
off-gas system.

The glove boxes are equipped for, or are adapt-
able to, a variety of operations, but the study

research are the principal uses planned for this
laboratory. A Zeiss polarizing microscope, a
Mettler balance, and a quenching-furnace arrange-

stainiess steel box at the right side of the angle
of the train in Fig. 3.9 is fitted with a stain-
less steel heating well that is welded to the
bottom of the box and is surrounded by a 5-in,
tube furnace. Most of the high-temperature studies
other than quenching will be performed in this
box which is also egquipped with a manifold to
control application of vacuum or admission of
helium, hydrogen, or HF to flanged pots in the
heating well.

An experiment was performed in this box to

ium at tracer concentration (<1 ppb ?°’Pa) was
completely precipitated by addition of thorium

fraction essentially free of alpha-emitting daugh-
ters and, according to the originator of the proc-

impurity in the oxide received from England.

sufficiently high to be of poteatial practical
interest.

For convenience and visibility, the LiCl-KC
cutectic, contained in an open 400-m! Pyrex

beaker, was used as the melt to which impurities
were added. Stirring was accomplished with a
Pyrex propeller stirring rod revolving at 700
tpm. The beaker was lowered from a hot zone
to a cold zone at a rate of about 2 cm/hr; this
was near the lower limit of rates that were deemed
of practical interest and was not changed. After
some preliminary trials, the segregations shown
in Table 3.4 were obtained while using a coiled

Calrod heating element. Beneath the heating
element there was a ring with holes through
which cooling air was blown; this helped fix

the location of the freezing front.

The preparation of all MSRE {luoride mixtures
and the loading of these mixtures intc the reacior
drain tanks have been completed by Reactor Chem-
istry  Division personnel. Preparation of the
secondary-coolant and the flush sait (totaling
15,000 b of 7LiF~BeF2 mizxfure containing 66
mole % "LiF) was completed and the mixture was
foaded into the MSRE during 1964.':? MSRE
fuel was prepared as the following salt composi-
tions: fuel solvent ("LiF-BeF -ZiF , 64.7-30.1-5.2
mole %), depleted fuel concentrate (LiF-*370F |
73-27 mole %3, and enriched fuel conceatrate
("LiF-?%5UF , 73-27 mole %).

The enriched fuel concentrate (six batches, sach
containing about 33 1b of 275U} and most of the
11.000 1bh of fuel solvent were prepared during
1964.7°7  The few remaining batches (eachk of
about 275 1b) of this material and the two batches
{of about 600 ib) of depleted fuel concentrate were
prepared during early 1965 by the technique de-
scribed previcusly.?

Loading of the fuel mixfures isto the MSRE to
achieve final fuel composition for criticality and
for eventual power operation was completed during
this reporting period. Initial loading consisted in
the transfer of 10,050 1b of fuel solvent to the fuel
drein tank and the addition of 320 (b of depleted
fuel concentrate.  This mixture,

reactor circuit, was circulated there for some 250
hr in a precritical test (PC-2), and was returned to
the MSRE drain tank. There, enriched fuel con-
centrate was added. Four additions of the con-
centrate (with criticality tests of the fuel in the
reactor core interspersed) brought the **5U inven-
tory of the drain-tank contents to 68.76 kg. These
operations  had been accomplished in a routine
manner by previously described techniques ' ? by
late May 1965.

Additions of enriched fuel concentrate to the
MSRE tank had, as anticipated, brought the 23°U
conceniration to more than 95% of that required for
criticality. The remaining ?°°U was added to the
fuel circulating in MSRE as solid pellets of enriched
fuel concentrate in small nickel capsules.® These
capsules, each containing about 85 g of 27°U

CHEMICAL BEHAYIOR OF FLUORIDES
DURING MSRE OPERATION

R. E. Thoma

The necessary service operations and the eval-
uations to determine whether the molten fluorides
retain their chemical purity during MSRE operation

 

 
form an important, integral part of the MSRE sup-
port program. In preparation for this effort, inves-
tigations have been made — and in some cases are
continuing ~— in such diverse lines as crystalliza-
tionn behavior of reactor salts,*'® solubility of
possible contaminant oxides as a function of
temperature,® compatibility of fluorides with their
metallic environments,” and the effects of irradia-
tion on molten and frozen salts.® In a closely
cooperative effort, the ORNL Analytical Chemistry
Division has developed methods for routine-basis
analyses for the several species whose concentra-
tions must be known if chemical integrity of the
system is to be assured.

Initial, precritical operation of the MSRE (run
PC-1) was performed with flush salt (7LiF‘-BeF2,
66 mole % 7LiF) in the fuel circuit. This flush
salt, therefore, constituted the frozen-salt seal in
the freeze flanges and the freeze valves of the core
circuit. After circulation for a 1000-hr test (and
for removal of oxide scale, if any, from the reactor
circuit), the flush salt was drained to its own
storage tank., There it was treated with HF and H,
to remove oxide before reuse; a reassuringly small
quantity, corresponding to 115 ppm of 0?7, was
recovered as H O in this step.

The fuel mixture was then constituted — with
an interruption for the PC-2 test — in the fuel
drain tank and the reactor circuit as described
in the section immediately preceding. Since the
reactor citcuitry does not drain perfectly, the not
unexpected result was the dilution of the fuel
mixture by some flush salt left in the reactor from
PC-1. This dilution resulted in a disparity between
nominal and analytical values for uranium con-
centrations in PC-2 and in differences between
nominal and measured 238U enrichment values
during the zero-power experiments. We believe
that approximately 140 lb (less than 1.5%) of the
"LiF-BeF | flush-salt diluent remained in the fuel
circuitry at the end of the PC-1 test and was

responsible for the apparent discrepancy. Careful
chemical analysis and mass-spectrometric deter-
mination of the 235U/?38U ratio indicate that
the critical concentration in the MSRE was 4.453%
by weight of U (1.39% %35U). This figure is lower
by 1.26% than the book value of 4.51% U.

Analysis samples for metallic corrosion
products continues to indicate that, as expected,
corrcsion of the INOR-8 by the fluoride melts is
insignificant.  The compounds NiF, and FeF
are unstable toward reduction by Cr in INOR-8;
these fluorides would be corrosion agents, therefore,
if present in the fluids. Neither FeF nor NiF
is stable toward reduction by Hz at elevated
temperatures; the pretreatment of fuel, flush, and
coolant salts with HF-H  and then H = should,
therefore, have removed other fluorides completely.
Chemical analysis of the tluoride mixtures before
introduction into the reactor showed about 5 ppm
of Ni and about 125 ppm of Fe. We believe that
these materials are present largely, if not entirely,
as colloidally suspended metals. On the other
hand, CrF, is not reduced by H,; the analyzed
concentration of Cr (about 30 ppm initially) is
believed to be present as Ccr?”,

During the PC-1 test, with "LiF-BeF , (66 mole
% 7LiF) in the fuel and coolant circuits, chromium
concentrations in the melt increased by about
25 ppm in the fuel circuit and by about 10 ppm
in the coolant circuit; thus, about 100 g of Cr
was removed from the interior walls of the reactor
circuit. Nickel concentrations remained at about
5 ppm during this test, while Fe concentrations
dropped by about 50 ppm. Occurrence of 30 ppm
of Fe?” in the initial melt is {aside from the
material-balance difficulty) scarcely credible. The
decrease in Fe concentration, therefore, was
believed to be due to settling of some 200 g of
Fe powder in the drain tank or in the circuit. The
increase in chromium concertration represents, we
believe, a teal increase in Cr?'; it is probably
due to dissolving of oxide films from the reactor
circuit walls and the subsequent reduction by Cr
of the C1%%, Fe3™, and Ni?" so obtained.

Analyses for Fe, Cr, and Ni in the reactor fuel
of PC-2 and of subsequent critical and zero-power
runs (totaling about 1100 hr) show no appreciable
concentration changes. The failure of Ct2¥ to
increase in concentration is not surprising since
the oxides should have been well removed in PC-1
and since the fuel mixture was thoroughly treated

of
with H2 (to the extent that about 2% of the uranium
was present as U®?) before addition to the re-
actor.

Purity of the fuel during PC-2 and the zero-power
tests was assured by chemical analysis of daily
samples. Values for the concentration levels of
all contaminants except oxide were uniform, credible,
and satisfactorily low. Ozxide values, obtained by
the KBrF4 method,® were sporadic and high, pre-
sumably as a result of water adsorbed in samples

limits was made by regular examination of salt
specimens employing petrographic methods, which

Oxide concentration is regarded as equivalent to
the quantity of water evolved as a molten-salt

The method has been applied for assay of the
flush-
initial operations of the MSRE full-power tests.
Oxide concentration was found to be approximately
100 ppm in both the flush and fuel salts.'?

From a chemical standpoint, the operation of the

and fuel-salt specimens obtained during

MSRE during the precritical and zero-power experi-
ments was a success. There is every reason to
believe that the salts were maintained in an ex-
cellent state of purity during all transfer, fill,
and circulating operations.

MEASUREMENT OF DENSITIES
OF MOLTEN SALTS

B. J. Sturm R. E. Thoma

Relatively few measurements of the densities
of liquid salt mixtures have been made in the
development of ORNL molten-salt technology.
Values have usually been obtained from estimates
such as the relatively imprecise method of mixtures
employed by Cohen and Jones,'? based on room-
temperature densities of the components, or the
more satisfactory method employed by Cantor,'3
which assumes additivity of molar volumes. In
an effort to obtain more accurate experimental
values, we have measured directly the volumes of
molten-salt mixtures at various temperatures. Initial
results of these experiments were reported pre-
viously.'* By adopting several experiinental in-
novations, we have improved the accuracy of
experimental data appreciably. One such measure
is to prevent salt mixtures from freezing until all
volume wmeaswrements have been completed. In
this way, errors in the volume measurement arising
from distortion of the container vessel upon freez-
ing and remelting the salts are avoided. Values
obtained by this experimental procedure are com-
pared with previous values in Table 4.1. The
equation for density, d, as a function of temperature
is

d-a- bt.

The new values are considered to be in agreement
with the recent measurements of the salts stored
in drain tanks at the MSRE site.?

MECHANISM OF RADIATION CORROSION

Oxide Growth and Film Capacitance on
Preirradiated Specimens

Previous wortk,® which showed that reactor ir-
radiation of Zircaloy-2 caused accelerated post-
irradiation corrosion, was extended to crystal-bar
zirconium. Specimens were: (1) pickled in HF-
HNO_, (2) vacuum (1 to 3 x 10~° mm Hg) annealed
at 700°C to remove traces of fluoride, and (3)
exposed to 300°C steam-oxygen for 1 hr and heated
in helium at 500°C for 16 hr to provide an oxygen-
rich layer near the surface. The subsequent
treatments were the same as in previous experi-
ments.® Data from two specimens, one irradiated
and one contrel, show that the irradiated specimen
corrodes about twice as fast as the control. [t

related to the additives in Zircaloy-2 nor to fluo-
ride left by pickling. '

Oxide-Fiim Properties

It can be posiulated that the irradiation damage
results in less protective oxide.® Altemating-
current impedance data were collected?® in the hope
that they would distinguish, on an empirical basis,
between oxides of varying protective quality.
They did not. Some exploratory work has there-
fore been done to find a better method to evaluate
film protective properties. The two prevalent
theories of oxidation of zirconium are: (1) diffu-
sion of anion vacancies through a concentration
gradient and (2) diffusion of an oxygen species
through pores. Methods of measuring vacancies
ot pores were therefore sought.

The Anion-Yacancy Grodient. — Recently an
indirect measure of the anion-vacancy concentra-
tion gradient in tantalum oxide was reported by
others.? Film capacitance vs temperature was
measured; above a critical temperature a rapid
rise in capacitance occurred from the increased

atory experimental work in which specimens were
heated for short times (<1 hr) in helium or oxygen
did not show the effect. Additional work is planned.
Direct-Current Resistance. — The possibility
was explored of determining dc resistance of anodic
films on zirconium using contacts of mercury,
evaporated silver, and gallium. The apparent
resistances with silver, mercury, or unrubbed
gallium drifted to higher values with time., Ac-
cordingly, it was concluded that these contacts
are not suitable, at least without additional work,
Contacts made by rubbing gallium onto the surface
were stable, they obeyed Ohm’s law, they were
the same at either polarity, and they were propor-
tional to filin thickness; but they were more than
four orders of magnitude lower than can be recon-
ciled with ac impedances measured in electrolytes.
The ac impedances with the rubbed gallium contacts
are consistent with the dc resistance and fit a
simple parallel resistance-capacitance equivalent
circuit. (1) the
gallium filling pores (4 x 107'* cm? pore area/
cm?) or (2) the gallium being rubbed through an
outer, to an inner
layer of resistivity about 5 x 107 ohm-cm. Since
the significance of the resistances is uncertain,
work on this will probably not continue,
Permeability, — Zirconia membranes made by

films are permeable to potassium nitrate in solu-

is a process of permeation through pores.

Coolant, ORNL-3848 (Cctober 1965).
We have planned and are developing experiments
to test the stability of CdSO, solutions under
electron with intensity and other
conditions such that they either simulate those in
the reactor or provide a severe test of the stability
under irradiation.

Test solutions in contact with Zircaloy-2 at
temperatures in the range 60 to 120°C will be ir-
radiated at power densities up to 150 w/cm?®, The
solution will be static in one type of experiment.
In another type, the solution will be circulated in
otdet to simulate fluid-film conditions in the re~

irradiation,

actor. The temperatures, power densities, solu-
tion compeositions, and contlainer material will be
those of possible interest in the reactor, The use
of electrons rather than reactor radiations is ex-
pected, from theoretical considerations,
crease the chance that an irradiaiion effect will
occuy at a given power density. The two ditferent
types of experiments are believed necessary to
assure that the radiation stability is tested under
conditions at least as severe as those in the re-
actor. Theoretical considerations did not enable
us to predict reliably whether agitation would
have any effect on the solution stability o, in
fact, the direction of an effect if one occurred.

The static iradiation cell is comprised of a
single loop of small-bore Zircaloy-2 tubing sur-
rounded by a coolant jacket, as shown in Fig,
5.2. The Zircaloy-2 tubing contains a fine filter
at one end of the leop. In operation, the test solu-
tion will be exposed to radiation in the Zircaloy-2
- {ube, It will then be forced through the filter,
collected, and analyzed. The temperature will
be controlled by passing controlled-temperature
water through the jacket at a rapid rate. The re-
sults of component testing of the static system
have provided reasonable assurance of design
feasibility and adequacy. The final test system
iz under construction.

Dynamic experiments will be conducted with a
small, high-speed (35,000 rpm), centrifugal pump
with which solution is circulated through a small
tube which fomms a loop in front of the cover plate
of the pump. The diameter of the pump is about
1/2 in., and the total liquid volume is about 1,:} cm®.
All the solution will be irradiated continuously
during an exposure. The tube is included in order
to provide a channel in which the flow is well
defined and in which film coefficients can be cal-
culated and, if necessary, measured. Calculations

Beryllium Corrosion

Three high-flux reactors either being constructed
or designed will use metallic beryllium, exposed
directly to the coolant, as moderator. The reactors
are the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR), the
Advanced Test Reactor (ATR), and the Argonne
Reactor (AARR). In the
first two reactors, the coolant will be water ad-
justed to a pl of 5.0 with nitric acid at a maximum
temperature of about 100°C; in the AARR, the
coolant will be deionized water at a slightly lower
temperature.

Test results reported previously'® showed that,
in water adjusted to a pH of 5.0 and tlowing at 12
to 80 fps, beryllium corroded at a constant rate of
1.9 mils/year over periods that lasted as long as
17,600 hr. A few small pits were noted on some
of the specimens. In these tests, the ratio of

was 10 cm?/liter and the system contained 22.5

In one of the specimens in the above series of

ever reported,

In recent tests conducted for the AARR in de-
ionized water at 93°C (200°F) at 44 fps, the effect
of the ratic of surface area of exposed beryllium
to volume of water was examined. In tests that
lasted in excess of 1000 hr, it was shown that
when the exposed beryllium area was 0.45 cm’
per liter of water, the beryllium corroded at a
constant rate of 2.7 mils/year. Under identical
conditions with a surface-area-to-volume ratio of
4.5 cm?/liter, the corrosion rate was 1.1 mils/
vear. In both of the above tests, the total volume
of water in the system was 27.6 liters and a side
stream was passed through a mixed-bed deionizer
at a rate of 4.9 liters/hr, This is the same relative
rate of deionization that will be used in the AARR.
The ratio of exposed surface area of beryllium to
volume of water in the AARR is 2.3 cm?/liter,
essentially midway between the cxtremes tested,

Although one isolated case of apparent stress-
corrosion cracking was observed and a few small
isolated pits were found, the test results indicate
that unclad beryllium will have adequate corrosion
resistance in the three new reactors,

Chemical Development for HFIR Operation

G. H. Jenks has concluded from a study of the
expected radiation chemistry of the HFIR coolant
(water adjusted to a pH of 5.0 with nitric acid)
that either oxygen or hydrogen peroxide at some
moderate level must be present in the coolant to
assure the stability of the nitrate ions.!” It is,
therefore, desirable to monitor continuously the
excess oxidizing capacity of the solution, that
is, the concentration of oxygen and hydrogen
peroxide in excess of the equivalent concentration
of hydrogen, During precritical hydraulic testing
of the HFIR system, the usefulness of a con-
based on the reaction

present in the reactor water reacts with thallium
metal relatively slowly aad irreproducibly, so it
was necessary to include a catalytic chamber cons
taining a large surface area of platinum to de-
compose the peroxide and permit measurement
of total available oxygen. Laboratory studies
showed that the platinum effectively recombines
dissolved hydrogen and oxygen, so that in the
HFIR system only the excess oxidant will be
measured, This measurement will be used to
conirol the addition rate of oxidant (either oxygen
or hydrogen peroxide) to the HFIR primary coolant.

With the above analyzer and confirmatory chemi-
cal analyses, the decomposition rate of hydrogen
peroxide in the primary coolant was determined in
the absence of radiation. The results indicated
that the decomposition is a homogeneous solution
reaction with a half-life of about 6 hr at 105 to
110°F.

Hydriding of Zircaloy-2 and Tantalum
In the Transuranium Processing Facility, the

aluminum=-clad target rods irradiated in the HFIR
will be dissolved in hydrochloric acid, Both

Zircaloy-2 and tantalum have adequate corrosion
resistance to the acid solution for equipment use,
but both can suffer hydrogen embrittlement under
some conditions. Therefore, a series of tests with
both materials was conducted to determine the
amount of hydrogen entering the metal from the
corrosion process and its effect on the ductility
of the material.

Zircaloy~2 strips, 10 mils thick, and tantalum
specimens of similar thickness were exposed to
8 M HCl at several temperatures for periods of
1000, 2000, and 3000 hr, After exposure, each
specimen was given a 180° bend test as a qualita-
tive measure of its ductility. Originally, the
Zircaloy-2 contained 8 ppm hydrogen and the
tantalum 1 ppm.

The hydrogen content and cor-
rate of the Zircaloy-2 specimens after
various exposure periods and the results of the
bend tests are shown in Table 5.2

At each temperature, the hydrogen content ap-
peared to be approaching a limiting value after
2000 to 3000 hr. Generally, the corrosion rate
and the corresponding hydrogen content increased
with temperature. For the particular geometry
involved, the hydrogen concentration required to

Corrosion Testing in Support of
Power-Reactor Fuel-Element Reprocessing

During the past year, the effort in this program
has been concerned solely with the behavior of
pure nickel and Hastelloy N in various gas-phase
head-end treatments. In the gas-phase processes,
the fuel elements are suspended in a fluidized bed
of aluminum oxide, and, depending on the specific

process, are subjected cyclically to fluorine, 60-
40 mixtures of oxygen and hydrogen fluoride, and
oxygen alone at temperatures as high as 800°C.
In the tests conducted, specimens of both materials
were exposed in the fluidized bed and in the gas
phase above it.

Both Hastelloy N and nickel underwent only
minor corrosion during 31 cycles of exposure to a
60-40 mixture of O -HF at 625°C. Each cycle
consisted of a period of 1 hr for heatup, 6 hr at
temperature, and 1 hr for cooling, Both alloys
were heavily oxidized on exposure to oxygen at
800°C. However, only Hastelloy N was signifi-
cantly corroded during eight cycles of a process
consisting of 6 hr in oxygen at 550°C followed by
6 hr in fluorine at 550°C. Additional testing in a
cycle consisting of 6 hr in a 60-40 mixture of
O,-HF at 625°C followed by 6 hr in fluorine at
550°C showed that the attack on nickel was light
but that Hastelloy N specimens were heavily
attacked on the edges.

ELECTRICAL CONDUCTANCE MEASUREMENTS

because of experimental difficulties with the
Bridgman type of pressure seal in the high-tem-
perature region of the conductance cell, a new
cell was constructed which eliminated the pressﬁre
seals in the high-tempetature region. This new
cell was constructed from a cylinder of Udimet
700, 24 in. long and 1 in. in diameter. A hole
0.250 in. in diameter was drilled the length of
the bar, and . platinum-iridium liners were inserted
to prevent corrosion of the Udimet 700 by the
high-temperature aqueous solutions. The other
parts of the conductance cell are of the same
design as described earlier. !> :
Both conductance cells were used for measure-

more researchers make conductance measurements

AQUEQUS SOLUBILITY OF MAGNETITE
AT ELEVATED TEMPERATURES

F. H. Sweeton R. W. Ray
C. F. Baes, Jr.

The solubility of magnetite (Fe,0,) in agueous
solutions at elevated temperatures is of special
interest in pressurized-water reactor systems, in
which Fe, 0, is a main component of the corrosion
film. It also is of interest to geologists in under-
standing the origin of Fe O, deposits.®

The flowing system for measuring the solubility
that was reported earlier® has been modified in
several ways to improve the precision of the data,
One important change has been the substitution
of 66 g of nonradioactive Fe O, for 2.7 g of
radioactive material, thus making possible a longer
contact time with the solution. This Fe,0, was
prepared by oxidizing a carbony! iron powder with
steam at 400 to 500°C. Its final specific surface
area was 0.12 m?/g, about twice that of the radio-
active material.

Water for the tests was purified and equilibrated
with H, as before. All batches had conductivities
of less than 0.08 micromho/cm at room tempera-
tures, and concentrations of dissolved O, below
10 ppb (and usually less than 5 ppb).

The purified water, sometimes containing added
HCl, was pumped first through a recombiner in
which it made contact with platinoum black at
260°C (to catalyze the reaction of the remaining
O, with H,), and on through the bed of Fe 0, in
a column held at a controlled temperature. The
solution was then cooled and passed through a
Millipore filter with 0.1-u pores. The recombiner,
column, and filter holder were made of gold-plated
stainless steel. Platinum tubing was used to

connect the units. The equilibrated solution was

and we are now modifying the pH cell to prevent
this. The solubility product estimated for 200°C
predicts that the solubility of Fe,0, in pure H,0
should be 1.4 pm; this is in good agreement with
our previcusly reported® figure of 1.5 um.

We will continue measurements to cover the
range of 150 to 260°C with HC! solutions from
0 to 30 pm with the intention of examining the
data to see if the dissolved iron is hydrolyzed.

SOLUBILITIES OF CALCIUM HYDROXIDE AND
SATURATION BEHAVIOR OF CALCIUM
HYDROXIDE~CALCIUM CARBONATE MIXTURES
IN AQUEOUS 50DIUM NITRATE SOLUTIONS
FROM 0.5 TO 350°C

L. B. Yeatts, Jr. W. L. Marshall

The solubilities of calcium hydroxide and the
saturation behavior of calcium hydroxide—calcium
carbonate mixtures were determined at tempera-
tures from 0.5 to 350°C in aqueous solutions of
sodium nitrate from 0 to above 3 m in concen-
tration.

Commercially available reagent grade calcium
hydroxide wand calcium carbonate were digested
in boiling deionized water to remove soluble im-
purities. The hot solutions were filtered and the
recovered product dried at 100 to 110°C. The dry
calcium hydroxide was ignited at 1150°C for about
i6 hr to convert calcium carbonate impurities to
calcium oxide; the carbon dioxide content of the

freshly ignited oxide was about 250 ppm. Excess
solid calcium hydroxide and mixtures of calcium
hydroxide and calcium carbonate were equilibrated
with aqueous sodium nitrate, prepared with de-
ionized water, using rocking equipment. The
containing vessels for the 0.5 and 25°C experi-
ments were Pyrex stoppered bottles; for the 50
to 350°C experiments, they were titanium alloy
bombs. The solutions were filtered during sample
withdrawal at the temperature of the experimeit
in order to remove suspended solids. A portion
of each sample was treated with excess concen-
trated nitric acid, evaporated to dryness at 95 to
100°C, and weighed as calcium and sodium ni-
trates. Another portion of each sample solution
was used for the determination of calcium ion
concentration by a potentiometric titration with
standard EDTA solution.
tration in the solution was determined by difference
from the results of these two analyses.

The dissolution of calcium hydroxide was as-
sumed to reach the following equilibrium;:

Water Vapor Adsorption and Desorption

€. L. Fuller, Jr. H. F'. Holmes

The complex nature of water adsorption on tho-
rium oxide has been studied by use of a sensitive
microbalance. High-temperature sintering (1200°C)
appears to produce a material which predominantly
presents the 100 cubic face in the surface, upon
which there are three distinct modes of adsorption.
There is an initial rapid chemisorption, formiung
surface hydroxyl groups which are slowly hydrated.
In addition and as a precursor for surface hydra-
tion, physical adsorption occurs,

constructed at 25.00°C reveal the
type II physical adsorption isotherms character-
istic of polar adsorbates. In addition, the slow
hydrating process occurs as a perturbing effect:
each successive isotherm fails to close upon
the preceding one by a decreasing amount until,
after six months of repetitive adsorption and de-
reproducible

sorption, a isotherm is achieved.

The rate of irreversible binding is a complex
function of both the water vapor pressure and the
amount of water previously bound. The rate is
increased markedly with the first increments of
pressure, but higher pressure
less accelerating effects. The rate diminishes
appreciably as more water is bhound under the
physically adsorbed water.  The final vacuum
weight of adsorbed water corresponds exactly to
the aforementioned stoichiometry.

increments have

The 1000°C calcination decreases the number
of pores but does not alter the distribution (there
are siill pores of radii near 10 A); whereas the
small pores anneal out at the 1200°C calcination,
leaving a minimum radius of 30 A.  The fact
that thorium oxide must be heated to 1000°C
in vacuo to remove all water indicates that there
are two different types of sintering involved.

The amount of bound water is stoichiometrically
equivalent to that required to form the surface
analog of a hydrated bulk hydroxide. In addition,
this is the amount of water required to build up
one completed face-centered cubic lattice unit
on the surface above the 100 Th()é plane, with
the hydroxide and water oxygen occupying the
image pesitions of the substrate oxide ions. Thus
this bound water may be similar to the cubic form
of ice, where the O—Q spacing is nearly equal to
that present in bulk Th()z.

The shape of the nitrogen isotherms at --195°C
changes, showing that the partial pressure at
which monolayer (BET) coverage occurs increases
from below 0.05 to 0.13 as more water is: pre-
adsorbed. This is undoubtedly due to the fact
that the water-covered surface is less energetic
and has less affinity for the nitrogen.

The extremely low vapor pressure of the initially
adsorbed waler and the complex kinetics of hydra-
tion must be considered before evaluating thermo-
dynamic properties or specific surface areas from
water isotherms. One must be equally cauntious
when attempting to predict the amount of adsorp-
tion from these isotherms.

the various absorption bands with increasing out-

Electrokinetic effects of agqueous solutions in

pated from the standpoint of irreversible thermo-
dynamics.'® A kinetic electroosmotic technique
was used to determine the electrokinetic poten-

with streaming potential data except in the pres-
ence of acidic solutions, In general, the electro-
kinetic zeta potential was observed to decrease
with incteasing pH, varying from about +25 mv
to —55 mv with an isoelectric point near pH = 9.4.

An important feature of the results shown in
Fig. 7.3 is the fact that they are some two to
three orders of magnitude larger than would be
predicted from the classical theories of surface
conductance.!® In addition, there seems to be
no obvious relationship between the surface con-
ductivity and the electrokinetic potential as pre-
dicted by these theories. Classically, the expo-
nential dependence of surface conductivity on
the electrokinetic potential is based on the pres-
ence of excess ions in the double layer due to
the potential difference. In the present system,
however, it appears that the contribution of the
excess ions in the double layer is masked by a
second mechanism which is much larger in magni-
tude.

It is believed that this second mechanism is the
ionization and subsequent conductance of surface
hydroxyl groups. This mechanism is further indi-
cated by the relatively slight dependence of the
surface conductivity on the bulk ionic concentra-
tion, implying that the concentration of the sur-
face conducting species is also only slightly
dependent on the bulk ionic concentration. If
the major mechanism for surface conductance is
ionization of surface hydroxyl groups, it should be
dependent on pH, as shown by the consistently
high values obtained with NH OH. In the case of
basic solutions of Na,CO,, however, the slight but
consistent reduction in surface conductivity may
be due to strong specific adsorption of carbonate

ions.

face area, was an important parameter, with respect
to both the amount and composition of the gas
evolved, and that CO, was reversibly absorbed
at temperatures below 500°C and easily desorbed
at higher temperatures.

Studies during the past year have been directed
toward the development of treatments which would
reduce the surface area of the prepared sol-ge!l
and thus reduce the amount of gas which it could
release in service. Batch exposures at temper-
atures of 1000°C to CO, or H,0 alone did not
give any substantial change in the surface area
of the sol-gel or in its capacity for reversible
adsorption of COQ. On the other hand, mixtures
of the two gases, CO, and H,O, at 1000°C were
found to give approximately 50% decreases in
the surface area and absorption capacity of the
sol-ge!l for each treatment. The duration of the
treatment did not appear to be important. Thus,
two treatments would reduce the surface area to
25% of the original — three to 12.5% of the orig-
inal. Tests in which the sol-gel pellets were
ground to successively smaller particle sizes
between successive batch treatments with mix-
tures of H,O and CO, at 1000°C suggested that
the effect of the treatment permeated the entire
material and was not localized at the superficial
surface exposed by grinding. Table 7.1 illus-

Since batch treatments are not convenient for
larger-scale concepts and since single batch
treatments, however extended did not
give more than 50% reduction in area, the effect
of treatment in a flowing stream of H,0 + CO,
at 1000°C was studied. As shown in Fig. 7.4, the
flowing-stream technique was much more effective;

Corresponding reductions in the BET surface

of the semilogarithmic plot in Fig. 7.4 sugpgests
that there may be a simple first-order process

tions involved have not been elucidated.

less gas evolution upon being ground io the as-

about 0.30 std cc/g of gas was evolved, compared

An even more striking reduction was noted in the
capacity of the FL series for reversible CO,
adsorption; values of 0.02 std cc/g were obtained,

the new material, if its preparation proves to be
reproducible, should be much superior from the
point of view of gas evolution and might not re-

TRANSPORT PROPERTIES OF GASES

Rotational Relaxation
Numbers for Nitrogen and Catbon Dioxide

Thermal Transpiration.

A. P. Malinauskas

It is well known that serious errors in pressure
measurement can result if the manometer is
maintained at a temperature other than that of
the region whose pressure is of interest. The
phenomenon responsible for the discrepancy is
known as thermal transpiration (or the “thermo-
molecular pressure effect®’) and is defined as the
transport of mass as the result of a temperature
gradient. Unlike thermal diffusion, however, which
is similarly defined, the thermal transpiration phe-
nomenon is not restricted to distinguishable par-
ticles. In fact, ever since its discovery in 1879
by Reynolds,! investigations of the effect have
been conducted exclusively with pure gases.

Unfortunately, the utility of the phenomenon was
thought to be solely that of a pressure correction;
as a result, the scientific community appears to
have been content with the empirical and semi-
empirical formulations which were proposed and
shown experimentally to be qualitatively correct
at  best. Recently, however, Mason and co-
workers,?*? in an attempt to describe gas trans-

reinvestigate the thermal transpiration effect and
uncovered a relation by which it appears possible
to obtain information regarding inelastic mo-
lecular collisions from thermal transpiration data.?

The first real test of the theories involved have
been completed in this laboratory during the past
year.” Thermal transpiration studies were con-
ducted with the gases Ar, Xe, N, and C'Oz‘
The phenomenon was generated by maintaining
temperatures of about 290°K and 545%K on the
opposite ends of fourteen O.l-mm-ID Pyrex glass
capillaries arranged in parailel.

Although several apparently minor discrepancies
between theory and experiment were noted, the
utility of the method for studies of inelastic col-
lisions has been demonstrated to be extremely
promiging. For example, the rotational collision
numbers for N, and CO, which were obtained from
the experimental data were found to be 4.4 and
2.4, respectively, and are in excellent agreement
with reported values which were determined by
the more conventional, elaborate,
methods. *

the interactions necessitates measurements either
over a wide range of temperature or of an accuracy
far better than that currently possible. Of the
two alternatives, the former appears to be the
more feasible. Indeed, some diffusion measure-
ments have been reported at temperatures as high
as 1100°K without a corresponding loss in
accuracy,5 but the experimental requirements are
so stringent and the procedure ig so elaborate
that a more simple approach is desirable. Such
an approach appears to have been provided by
theory, in that it is possible to relate the com-
position dependence of viscosity to the diffusion
coefficient characteristic of a given gas pair.®
Thus, because viscosity coefficients at high
(or low) temperatures can be readily determined
experimentally, the evaluation of diffusion data
via the theoretical relationship is worthy of in-
vestigation. Although the objectives of the dif=-

oriented toward an elucidation of intermolecular

This model, which is particularly useful for a
description of gas transport in the theoretically
difficult
and hydrodynamic mechanisms are of equal im-
portance, utilizes the somewhat unorthodox view
that the solid surfaces of a porous medium or of
the walls of capillaries may be mathematically re-
garded as agglomerates of giant gas molecules
(dust). As a result, a gas-surface interaction is
treated as a special type of molecular encounter
as would occur between two gas molecules when
one of the interacting molecules is immobile and
preponderantly larger and heavier than the other.

Use of the mode!l has yielded the first con-

due to a composition gradient; (2) gas flow as
the result of gradients in composition and pres-
sure; (3) thermal transpiration, in which pressure
and temperature gradients are involved; and (4)
migration (and separation) of gases under the
combined influence of composition and tempera-
ture gradients. However, our inability, at the
time, to cope with the combination of diffusive
and viscous modes of transport in a manner which
was satisfactory from a theoretical viewpoint
necessitated the introduction to a certain degree
of empirical methods in those cases in which
pressure gradients were at least partly respon-
sible for the particular transport phenomenon.

Somewhat erroneously, perhaps, we sought a
clarification of this so-called ‘‘forced-flow”’
problem in higher kinetic theory approximations.
The approach was fruitful in an indirect manner
in that it led to the discovery of the proper
procedure of combining diffusive and viscous
flows, and prebably to a complete solution of the
gas transpoit problem.

Stated briefly, one can separate (mentally)
motion in a gas mixture into a diffusive flux and
a viscous flux. What we have learned, however,
is that the total flux is simply the zum of these
two fluxes; that is, there is no direct interaction
between viscous and diffusive flows; the only
““cross term’’ of consequence can be absorbed
into a change in the pressure-diffusion coeffi-
cient.? Although this simple additivity relation
had been used previously by others, its theoretical

justification
To date, the theoretical reinvestigation of dif-
fusion in the presence of a pressure gradient has
been the most fruitful aspect of this work; a
semiempirical equation which had been derived
earlier has now been developed completely from
theory, with an explict expression for what had
been an empirical (and adjustable) coefficient.
Moreover, the new results lead directly to the
prediction of the Kramers-Kistemaker'? or Kirken~
dall'! effect, in which a pressure drop is gen-
erated when the net flux in a diffusing mixture
is zero. '

Present results evolved from two distinct ex-

a constant-potential source at the maximum con-
centration C .- the apparent solubility. In each
case, determinations of D, and Di (coefficients
for diffusion in the <a> and <c> directions)

tracted only from constant-potential results since

changes induced by high-temperature exposure

siderations of combined structural and

peratures the structures ‘‘improve’ in that they
tend to assume a graphitic structure; values of
the thermal conductivity and impurity-atom dif-
fusivity decrease. The tate and mode of this an-
nealing process are diffusion controlled and are
best interpreted through self-diffusion measure-
ments.

In systems other than graphite, self-diffusion
measurements may be circumvented, since the
self-diffusion coefficient has been correlated with
other properties more amenable to experimenta-
tion.  Analogous correlations for graphite are
undetermined; the necessity of conducting the
formidable self-diffusion experiments still re-
mains, if for no other reason than to obtain cor-
relations of the type mentioned.

We have initiated a systematic study of the
role of self-diffusion in the annealing phenomena
associated with graphites and carbons. From
this information we hope to estimate diffusion

parameters for perfect graphite crystals via
extrapolation of data for improved structures. A
series of special thorium-pyrocarbon diffusion
experiments has been completed pursuant to the
selection of materials and annealing conditions
for use in the present investigation. Observa-
tions of actinide diffusion patterns are quite
valuable in surveys of this sort, since actinides
migrate preferentially along defective paths in
carbons. As a result of these experiments, sev-
eral possible carbon candidates were chosen for
our initial self-diffusion studies.

Equipment and techniques used to study dif-
fusion of actinides and fission product species in

graphites and carbons are being modified as re-

quired in order to pemmit study of '*C diffusion.
The development of methods for accurate place-
ment of tracer on surfaces and the demonstration
of certain means of assay for the diffused isotope
pose the most immediate problems.

effect, if any, the addition of methane might have
on this reaction. Data obtained from these studies
are given in Table 9.1. Carbon removal calcu-
lated from CO, + CO found in the effluent gases
shows that the water vapor—graphite reaction was
retarded by the addition of methane, although to a
lesser extent than by an equal concentration of
hydrogen.? If only weight changes are detennined,
one might conclude that the oxidation of graphite
by water vapor was completely suppressed. Data
obtained from the effluent gases, however, show
that both oxidation and deposition occurred. The
calculated and observed weight changes agreed
satisfactorly in those cases where weight losses
or small weight gains were found. The calculated
weight changes were significantly larger than the
measured weight changes in those instances where
large weight gains prevailed. 'This behavior could
be due to spalling of carbon from the graphite sur-
face. Both the oxidation and deposition rates de-
creased with decreasing temperature and were not
measurable at temperatures much below 700°C.
Carbon deposition rates from methane-helium mix-
tures were determined in the absence of water
vapor to establish what effect water vapor might
have had on the cracking of methane. A compari-
son of the calculated deposition rates listed in
Table 9.1 with those given in Fig. 9.1 shows that
water vapor has very little, if any, effect on the
cracking of methane. The overall rates are dif-
ferent, however, in the two cases due te loss of
carbon by oxidation in the presence of water vapor.
The slopes of the plots given in Fig. 9.1 cor-
respond to activation energies of ™~ 50 kcal/mole
for all concentrations of methane examined. The

COMPATIBILITY OF PYROLYTIC-CARBON.
COATED FUEL PARTICLES WITH
WATER YAPOR

C. M. Blood

Current developments indicate that fuel particles
coated with pyrolytic carbon will be present in all-
ceramic cores of high-temperature gas-cooled re-
actors. Inleakage of water vapor during operation
of such a reactor poses hazards because of the
high temperatures of the core components, Oxida-
tion of the fuel particle coatings could cause coat-
ing failures and a resultant release of volatile fis-
sion products into the helium coolant.

The compatibility of wvarious batches of fuel
particles with water vapor has been examined® in
an attempt to evaluate the hazards. In these
studies, fuel particles were exposed at 1000°C to
flowing helium--water vapor mixtures having partial
pressures of water vapor of 4.5, 45, and 570 torrs.
The fuel particles had various types of pyrolytic
carbon coatings and cores of UC, or (U, TH)C,.
The reactivity of the fuel coatings was determined
from weight changes and effluent gas composi-
tfions, The incidence of failure of the coatings
was obtained from the quantities of wranium and
thorium removed by acid leach following exposure
fo water vapor. Microscopic and metallographic
examinations were made following exposure to

and unoxidized fuel particles.

Reaction rates for different batches of fuel par-
ticles obtained at 1000°C using various partial
pressures of water vapor are given in Fig. 9.2,
These data show that the apparent order of the
water vapor—coating reaction increased with in-
creasing partial pressure of water vapor in virtu-
ally all cases. This could be due, in part, to dif-
ferences in burnoff at the various partial pressures.

The studies are continuing, with emphasis being
placed on the effect of higher temperature (1200
to 1400°C) and of prior irradiation on the reactivity
with water vapor.

COMPATIBILITY OF METALS WITH LOW
CONCENTRATIONS OF CARBON MONOXIDE

J. E. Baker

In the BeO-graphite compatibility tests,® metals
are used as heat shields in an inert-gas atmosphere
containing ~ 200 ppm of carbon monoxide at tem-
peratures ranging from 400 to 800°C. Possible
deposition of carbon on the metal surfaces and the
resulting decrease in reflectance prompted a lab-
oratory study of the metals in an atmosphere ap-
proximating that prevailing in the engineering tests.

Specimens of molybdenuni, gold-plated stainless
steel, and mild steel were exposed to flowing
helium (1 atm) containing 250 to 300 ppm of carbon
monoxide at temperature intervals of ~100°C in
the temperature range of ~450 to 850°C. Expo-
sure times averaged ™30 hr at each temperature.
Weight changes were continuously recorded by a
sensitive analytical balance, and the influent and
effluent gases were analyzed by a sensitive gas
chromatograph. X-ray studies were made of the
exposed specimens in an attempt to identify any
deposits formed.

The molybdenum specimen gained ~10 pg/cm?
during an exposure time of ~150 hr. The weight
changes were so small that the effect of tempera-
ture could not be measured. The exposed speci-
men had a very thin dark-gray film and a few spots
suggesting localized attack. The film is probably
an oxide, which could have been produced by very
low concentrations of oxygen and/or water vapor
present as contaminants in the helium stream.
There was no evidence of carbon deposition.

The gold-plated stainless steel specimen showed
an overall weight gain of ~ 100 ug/cm? for an ex-
posure time of ~150 hr. The rate of weight gain

varied by about a factor of 2 over the temperature
range examined, with no consistent effect of tem-
perature evident. The exposed specimen had a
dull green color, suggesting failure of the gold
plate.  X-ray analysis showed the film to be
Cr,0, with no carbon present.

A bright specimen of mild steel lost ~ 170 pug/cm?
during ~ 150 hr. The rate of weight loss increased
with temperature. The surface was bright at the
end of the test and showed no evidence of carbon
deposition. A rusty specimen of mild steel lost
~ 1500 pg/cm? during ~150 hr, with no consistent
effect of temperature on the rate of weight loss

87

evident. The surface brightened during the ex-
posure, and x-ray analysis found only FeO present
in the surface film. Since the original specimen
had Fe O, and Fe O -H,O present, carbon monox-
ide reduction of the oxides seems responsible for
the large weight losses.

The results indicate that carbon is not deposited
on these metal surfaces in this temperature range
from low concentrations of carbon monoxide in
helium containing essentially no hydrogen or water
vapor. The situation could be different in the
presence of the latter.

In previous experiments'
diation damage to the pyrolytic carbon coating
was due primarily to fission fragments originating
at the core-coating interface. This damage can
be alleviated by providing a gap at the core-~
coating interface, by a porous carbon layer, or by
a sacrificial pyrolytic carbon layer. Particles
of dense UO2 have been coated (in the ORNL
Metals Division) by techniques
which provide one of these protective measures.
We have measured fission-gas release rates from
these three kinds of coated particles during

the ORR.? The irradiation temperature, burnup,
and fission-gas release data are given in Table

as shown in Table 10.1, remained very nearly con-

OR-348 were similar to those of OR-354 (porous,
isotropic on an oxide core), but the isotropic
coating was more dense. Initial values for frac-~
release from the OR-348 particles were
near 10~ %; the values increased to near 107 by
the end of the test. No bursts of fission gas were
observed. The third batch of particles (batch

Table 10.1, the fractional fission-gas release
nearly doubled when the temperature was increased
from 1400 to 1500°C, but it returned to about the
original value when the temperature wasg again
decreased to 1400°C.

We observed that a correlation could be made
between the degree of contamination in the coat-
ing and the fission-gas release from particles
with unbroken coatings (see Fig. 10.1), This
leads to the conclusion that (below 1400°C) the
fission-gas release from unbroken coatings is
predominantly from contamination in the coating
rather than from the fuel core.? We have found
that coated oxide particles have less contami-
nation in the coating than coated carbide par-
ticles.

each experiment were selected for metallographic
examination.? The particles made with an in-
tentional gap at the core-coating interface (batch
OR-298) revealed no failed coatings, although
their behavior during irradiation suggested that
a few particles did fail. Metallographic exami-
nation (see Fig. 10.2) showed that the inner

delamination but that the outer coating had re-
mained intact. No reaction product was obsetrved

coating applied directly to the UO, core would
shrink during high-temperature irradiation and
provide the gap necessary to relieve the stress
on the coating. This did indeed occur, as is
shown in Fig. 10.4. Although about 20% of the
coatings showed short fractures spiraling into the
inner coating, no failed coatings were observed.

The advantages of the UO2 cores over UC
cores became more obvious when it was observed
that the U0, wonld not convert to UC, as long as
the coating was intact. From our experience with
a variety of coated UO, particles, we conclude
that they are superior to the UC, particles for
the following reasons: (1) the oxide does not

Annealing studies of irradiated coated fuel par-

of the coatings at temperatures higher than that

of the irradiation and to measure their ability to
contain fission products. The particles tested
had fuel cores of UC,, (Th,U)C , or UO, with
duplex or triplex pyrolytic carbon coatings. They
were heated to temperatures up to 2000°C in a
flowing helium atmosphere; the fuinace com-
ponents were periodically removed for analysis to
measure fission product release as a function of
time and temperature. ®

The release rates obtained in five annealing
experiments at 1370, 1700, and 2000°C are com-
pated in Table 10.2. The values shown were
averaged over 6 hr of anneal following an initial
1-hr heating period at each temperature. A graph
of the cumulative releases vs time for barium and
strontium from three batches of particles is shown
in Fig. 10.5.

Accumulated Fission Product Release

The experiments so far have been performed
with fuel materials of current interest. Though
no systematic and basic study in fission product
release has been made, some trends are evident.
The behavier of triplex pyrolytic-carbon-coated
(Th,U)Cz particles shows some change with
burnup. Particles irradiated to 8.9%
burnup suffered 2% coating failures during the
initial hour at 1700°C or at 2000°C, while par~
ticles irradiated to 0.29% uranium burnup had no
failures during 19 hr at 2000°C. The lower re-
lease of barium and strontium at the higher burnup
remains without explanation.

Particles of UQ_ with an outer coating density
of 1.8 g/cm? had higher release rates for barium,
strontium, and cesium, but lower release rates
for cerium and yttrium than did {Th,U)C2 particles
with outer coating densities of about 2 g/cm?.
The higher release rates of barium, strontium, and
cerium may be due to the lower-density coating,
while the lower release rates of cerium and
ytirium in the UQO_ particles may indicate better
retention by the fuel core itself.

POSTIRRADIATION EXAMINATION OF
FUELED GRAPHITE SPHERES

D. R. Cuneo H. E. Robertson
J. G. Morgan C. D. Baumann
' E. L. Long, Jr.

We have completed the evaluation of five irra~
diation experiments that contained fueled graphite
elements in the form of spheres. These elements
were fueled with pyrolytic-carbon-coated particles
400 p in diameter dispersed in a graphite matrix.
A summary of the irradiations is shown in Table
10.3.  All of the spheres reported in the table
were 6 cm in diameter except those in experiment
8B-5, which were 1% in. in diameter. The spheres
of interest to the German AVR Pebble Bed Re-
actor Program were fabricated with unfueled outer
shells of machined graphite or shells molded
around the core matrix. Two of the spheres were
completely fueled (no unfueled shell).

In addition, we examined two spheres of interest
to the TARGET program. These were spheres of
graphite that contained several drilled holes into
which were poured loose coated particles. Ex-
periment 8B-5 contained eight 17 -in.-diam spheres
which underwent the highest burnups of any
spheres tested (™25 at. % of the heavy metal).
Metallographic examinations were carried out for
four spheres in this experiment; the remaining
four spheres were duplications of those examined
and were used for compression testing only. We
observed a high percentage of failure of the
laminar-coated particles in two spheres of this
experiment. Laminar-coated particles fabricated
by the same manufacturer but irradiated to about
1,45 the burnup were undamaged. Laminar-coated
(U,T‘ry)if,2 particles made with normal uranium
were found te have ceating fractures at the fuel-
coating interface and evidence of loss of crystal-
line detail in the fuel core. This is the only
case of damage we have observed in particles
containing normal uranium. Figure 10.6 is a
photomicrograph of a mnormal and an enriched
(U,Th)Cz particle from this experiment. We
found no broken coatings in the spheres that con-
tained either duplex- or triplex-coated fuel par-
ticles. Production-run Carbon Products Division
spheres, experiment O1A-8, operated successiully.
No damaged particles were found, and the non-
volatile fission products found in the graphite

diated to high burnups in experiment 8B-5. All
spheres had molded fuel cores. The two
spheres that were completely fueled (no unfueled

and an apparent gain in compression strength.

were found to exhibit the same degree of shrink-

However, from the large losses in
compression strength (irradiated vs unirradiated
spheres), we conclude that the molded cores
underwent considerable shrinkage, so that the
compression tests reflect only the strength of
the unfueled shell. Such loss of contact between
the core and shell adversely affects the heat
transfer from the core as well as the mechanical
strength of the sphere. The same trends can be
shown for 6-cm-diam spheres, although not to this
extent because of their low burnup.

POSTIRRADIATION EXAMINATION OF EGCR
FUEL ELEMENT PROTOTYPE CAPSULES

M. F. Osborne
E. L. Long, ]r.5

H. E. Robertson
J. G. Morgan

Except for one EGCR prototype capsule which
is still being irradiated, all the elements in this
series have been examined. Of those elements
irradiated in the ETR,’ six were examined vis-
ually and three were evaluated in detail, The
capsules coantained UQ, pellets fabricated at
ORNL; these pellets were either solid, hollow,
or hollow with a BeQ bushing. The design power
rating during irradiation was 35,000 Btu hr™!
ft—!, and the stainless steel cladding tempera-
ture varied from 1250 to 1550°F. The fuel re-
ceived burnups of from 4500 to 14,300 Mwd per
metric ton of uo,. Only one element experienced
cladding failure. The other elements had only
minor cladding deformation such as circumferential
ridges at pellet inteifaces and a collapse of the
cladding against the fuel. These effects were
observed in previous tests.?®

The element with cladding failure contained
solid UO, pellets. A longitudinal tear in the

cladding was apparently caused by overpowering
of the element early in the irradiation. Grain
growth in the cladding at the site of failure indi-
cated the presence of a hot spot. Unlike earlier
instanceg of cladding failure in this series, there
was no evidence of nitride formation in the clad-
ding or columnar grain growth in the fuel.

We have completed the evaluation of an EGCR
piototype capsule which had been irradiated in
the ORR. This element was of special interest
as it contained actual EGCR production-run UO,
pellets and 304H stainless steel cladding. The
irradiation was carried out at a heat rating of
31,000 Btu hr™! ft~! and a cladding temperature
of 1300°C. The dished-end hollow fuel pellets
achieved a burnup of 10,000 Mwd per metric ton
of UOz. Under these conditions, the cladding
had collapsed around the fuel but no circumferen-
tial ridges were formed. Bowing of the element
was nominal, and there was no shifting of the
fuel. The element had not failed, and its per-
formance was satisfactory under EGCR design
conditions.

of fission-gas release.® This theory postulates
that a defect in the UO, crystal structure will trap
migrating fission gas; the rate of fission-gas es-
cape, accordingly, is controlled by the number of
traps present. Gas-trapping defects consist of in-
herent flaws, such as grain boundaries and internal
pores, in the UO, as well as point defects and
clusters of point defects created as a consequence
of the fission process. Steady-state experiments
with single crystals’ and with polycrystalline
UO, (ref. 8) have supported this defect-trap theory.

We have modified the experimental assembly to
permit a slow, controlled oscillation of the speci-
men through the flux of neutrons.”? '? These modi-
fications permit a controlled sinusoidal variation
of neutron flux (fission rate) or specimen tempera-
ture. The fission gas released during the oscilla-
tions is monitored continuously by a gamma-ray
spectrometer. Time dependence of the temperature
(or the fission rate) and of the fission-gas release
rate is measured and recorded by punch-tape read-
out.'1-12 A computer program has been developed
to analyze the fission-gas release waves in terms
of their Fourier components; this analysis yields
amplitude and phase-shift information as a function
of frequency of the oscillation.

The effect of temperature oscillations was ob-
tained by comparing the steady-state release (at
zero frequency) with that at different frequencies.!?
The gas release was found to increase as the fre-
quency of oscillations increased; at very slow
oscillations the release rate approached steady-
state levels. This result is predicted by the defect-

come the trapping effect; the release rate in-
creases and approaches that predicted by models
hased upon classical diffusion theory.

Fission-gas release at temperatures below 600°C
occurs primarily by a recoil process wherein fis-
sion fragments passing through the surface of the
UO, specimen eject or ‘‘knock out’” UO, molecules
along with any fission-gas atoms in the knockout
zone. Knockout release during fission-rate oscil-
lations at a constant temperature of 575°C is
shown in Fig. 11.1. The data points of Fig. 11.1
form a sort of hysteresis curve; arrows by the
data points indicate whether the fission rate was
increasing or decreasing when the data were ob-
tained, The hysteresis curve shows the gas re-
lease rate to be higher during fission-rate oscilla-
tions than when the fission rate was constant.

We suggest that the data of Fig. 11.1 reflect the
rhythmically changing concentration of fission-gas
traps created by the fission process.
destruction and creation of traps allow the fission
gas to reach the specimen surface in surges. These
surges account for both the hysteresis and the in-

MATHEMATICAL MODEL

Material balance equations for fission-gas re-
lease {parent and daughter nuclides) from a thin
slab of fissionable material are based on produc-
tion, loss, and diffusion-leakage terms. In general:

Rate of change of concentration
— diffusion-leakage contribution -- loss terms

+ production terms .

For the diffusion-trapping model the loss terms in-
volve radioactive decay and trapping by intrinsic
flaws and point defects. The production terms in-
volve the fission rate, fission yield, and, for the
daughter, radioactive decay of the parent. The
concentration of point defects is a balance be-
tween their rate of formation as a consequence of
fission and their destruction by annealing at high
temperature.
101

Three material balance equations (for which the
symbols are defined in Table 11.1) result; they
are coupled and nonlinear.

At steady state (OM/dt = OH/dt = ON /dt = 0)
the equations become linear and can be solved by
conventional methods. The steady-state solutions
for the release rates yield expressions which are
similar in appearance to the expressions obtained
from the old diffusion model,’? except that the
decay constant, A, is replaced by an effective
decay constant, A’, which includes the effect of
trapping. An increase in temperature will increase
the rate of trap annealing and will decrease the
effective decay constant, A",
tron flux will increase the value of the A”, will tend
to neutralize the increase in production, and will
make the release rate fairly insensitive to flux

least, with the observed phenomena at steady state.

An approximate solution has been obtained for
the case where the flux is varied sinusoidally
while the temperature remains constant. To com-
pate the diffusion-trapping model with the simple
diffusion model, the analytical expressions for the
total release rate transfer functions for each model
were coded for numerical computations. The ampli-
tude of the release rate transfer function vs fre-
quency is shown in Fig. 11.2a. When the diffusion
model is used this amplitude decreases with the
square root of the frequency; when the diffusion-
trapping model is used this amplitude exhibits an
extended plateau in the low frequency range. As
the frequency increases, the frequency-dependent
factors overcome the trapping effects and both

the trapping effect predominates; hence the fre-

the magnitude of the transfer function.

Equivalent comparisons were made with the phase
shift (Fig. 11.2b) of the transfer function. In the
diffusion model, the phase shift quickly reaches
an asymptotic value of —45° and is independent of

Equilibrium studies of the system ThO,-U0,-UO,
were continued at partial pressures of O, equal
to that found in the atmosphere and at temperatures
ranging from 1200 to 1550°C. Previous work has
established the general features of the phase dia-
gram for the system. '—*

A study was made to determine if the scatter in
analytical compositions could be due to experi-
mental techniques. A temperature of 1550°C and
a composition of 90 mole % urania and 10 mole
% thoria were chosen for this work.

composition. Initial oxidation state and degree
of initial solid solution formation had a very small
effect on the equilibrium composition (less than
2.5%). When gquench conditions were varied by
substituting liquid N, submersion in place of
rapid air cooling, a reduction in UQO, content
from 29 to about 26 mole % was obtained. Com-

Miscellaneous Studies for Solid-Fueled Reactors

Unit cell dimensions were computed from x-ray
powder patterns using a least-squares fitting pro-
gram written by Williams® in place of the more
tedious graphical procedure. Test cases showed
no bias due to this change. Comparisons were
also made between the Debye-Scherrer camera
and the bench diffractometer methods of measur-
ing lattice parameters by the powder technique.
Good agreement was found in this case also.

An effort was made to better define the transition
temperature at which orthorhombic U30 4 converts
to the face-centered cubic UO,, phase in air.
The transition is sluggish, but the first sign of
the fcc phase appeared at 1528°C and progressed
fairly rapidly (50% in 2 hr) at 1540°C. No fcc
phase was cbserved after 2 hr at 1514°C. Tem-
perature calibration was felt to be reliable to
+5°C as measwred by two independent methods.
the year, Cohen and Berman of the
Westinghouse Bettis Laboratory reported on this
system® and found a lower urania composition
(50 mole %) for the two-phase boundary at 1200°C
than had been found in this study (~63 mole %).?
In view of this difference, a remeasurement at
1200°C was made using more recent technigues.
No effect could be ascribed to the use of pellets
at 60 mole % urania. This composition showed
some orthorhombic phase (V2 to 5%). Composi-
tions of 56, 53, and 45% urania displayed no
detectable orthothombic phase.  This indicates
that the phase boundary is between 56 and 60
mole % urania. Composition of 90% urania showed
little change from the older work.

Apparatus and equipment have been designed and
built to extend this study to lower partial pres-
sures of oxygen in the range of 107% atm, where

experimental series are specimens of each of
the monocarbides made by three different methods:
(1) hot pressing, (2) slip casting and sintering,
and (3) explosion pressing. Three low-temperature
(100 to 400°C) uninstrumented assemblies and
one instrumented high-temperature (1100°C) assem-

to achieve temperatures up to 1400°C.

Examination is complete for an assembly of one
sample of each of the five hot-pressed monocar-
bides irradiated (see Table 12.1) in the ORR at
about 100°C.7 Most of the specimens sustained
very little gross damage. Metallographic examina-

These preliminary results indicate that refrac-
tory-metal carbides are =ufficiently resistant to
fast neutrons to merit consideration for nuclear
applications involving high neutron doses. Tung-
sten carbide, in particular, is attractive because
of its small lattice parameter expansion and
small gross volume expansion. The magnitudes
of these expansions are generally reliable indi-
cations of the degree of neutron damage.

Among the three oxides, the greatest difference
in behavior was between MgQ, which has a cubic
structure, and BeQO, with a hexagonal crystal
structure. Previous resulis have shown that
the primary mode of damage to BeO is grain-
boundary separation caused by anisctropic crystal
The degree of damage, that is, frac-
turing or powdering, iucreases with increasing
dose and decreases with increasing temperature.
The cubic structure of MgQO precludes anisctropic
expansion, and the lattice parameter expansion
is much smaller than that of BeO. Accordingly,
irradiated MgO exhibits virtually no grain-bound-
ary separation, no powdering is observed, and
the pross volume expansion is small relative to
that of Bel,

Transgranular fracture is severe in MzO. For
example, about 40% of specimens irradiated at
150°C over the dose range 0.2 to 1.4 x 107!
neutrons/cm? were fractured. Unlike BeO, dam-
age to MgQ specimens was not related to the
neutron dose. Approximately 40% of the specimens
irradiated at 800°C and about 0% of the speci-
mens irradiated at 1100°C over the dose range 0.5

be explained by postulating that a minimal neu-
tron dose can weaken the crystals encugh to per-
mit the propagation of cracks from randomly dis-
tributed sites within MgQO compacts. The minimal
dose is probablv near the lower limit of our ex-
periments (~2 x 102° neutrons/cm?, >1 Mev),

since increases in strength have been reported for

21,22

lower doses by other experimenters. Direct

evidence is lacking that higher doses produce
weakening of MgO crystals, but electron micro-
graphs of MgQO irradiated to doses greater than
102! npeutrons/cm? (Figs. 12.1 and 12.2) show
a severe deterioration which, it seems likely,
would be accompanied by a loss in strength.

In-pile ancealing at high temperatures reduces
the volume expansion and lattice parameter ex-
pansion of MgO. Thermal stresses within neutron-
damaged compacts probably account for the mark-
edly greater gross damage observed in irradiations
at 1100°C.

The crystal stiucture of Al O, is anisotropic,
but the behavior of A1203 on exposure to fast
neutrons resembles that of MgO rather than BeO.

A comparison of the lattice parameter expansions
of the three oxides irradiated at low temperatures
to a dose of ~102! neutrons/cm? is shown in
Table 12.2. The a and ¢ parameters of Al,O,
expanded by about the same amount under these
conditions; this is in sharp contrast to the behav-
ior of Be(), in which nearly all the expansion is
in the ¢ parameter. Recent irradiations of trans-
lucent Al O, specimens (lucalox) to somewhat
higher doses (~1.4 x 102! neutrons/cm?) pro-
duced a greater expansion of ¢ parameter, how-
ever, and resulted in an anisotropic expansion
ratio (Ac/co)/(Aa/ao) of about 3.8. 'This ratio,
however, is small compared with that for BeO.
Therefore, the mechanisms through which Al O,
is fractured during fast-neutron irradiation appear
to be the same as in MgO.

ume expansion, decreases with increasing irradi-

oxides in nuclear reactor application, the temper-

and the system should be designed so as to mini-
mize thermal stress. In the case of BeO, thermal
cycling, which tends to promote grain-boundary
separation, should also be avoided.

THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY CHANGES
OF CERAMICS

C. D. Bopp

The annealing of the neutron-induced thermal
conductivity change has been measured in several
ceramic materials. The annealing temperatures are
listed in Table 12.3. A fluxmeter apparatus?3
was used with the materials of high conductivity,
and a mercury-contact apparatus?? was used with
the materials of lower conductivity. Previously,?®
the mercury-contact apparatus was used for pre-
and postirradiation measurements of these same
materials, but annealing was not studied. Com-
parison with the present results shows good
agreement except in the instance of thin speci-
mens of beryllia, for which it appears that the
mercury-contact apparatus is unsuitable because
of the extremely high conductivity of this mate-
rial. The annealing temperatures for beryllia
shown in Table 12.3 are in good agreement with
those found by other workers?® for material given
nearly the same irradiation dosage.

The average deviation from this equation of the
experimentally determined values of Kg shown in
Fig. 13.1 was 10.6%. Values of AHI® at each
temperature were obtained by differentiating Eq.
(5) with respect to 1/T(°K) and substituting the
the result into the van’t Hoff equation, (4), while
those values of AC® were obtained by differen-
tiating with respect to T the resulting expression
for AH®  While separate values of AC® might
be expected to be somewhat inaccurate, the
average value of AC® from 0 to 110°C of —57 cal

Values of AS® and AF® were obtained from the
standard thermodynamic equation,

AF®= AH® — T AS°. (6)

The Additional Sslid Phase

At concentrations of NaCl above 3 to 5 m and
at temperatures from 70 to 95°C, a saturating
solid other than CaSO4-2H20 or NaCl was found.
In special experiments at 70°C, this second
saturating solid phase was identified by petro~
graphic examination? to be N32804-5CaSO4-3H20,
found previously in the system CaClz-NazSO4-
H2O.3 By the formation of N82$O4-5Ca804-31{20
from solutions initially only of NaCl and CaSO,,
the system becomes a four-component system,

components CaSO4, NaCl, CaCIz, and H20.

THE OSMOTIC BEHAVIOR OF SIMULATED
SEA-SALT SOLUTIONS AT 123°C

P. B. Bien B. A, Soldano

The isopiestic technique previously developed
at ORNL* has been used to test the behavior of
thtee simulated sea-salt solutions at 123°C.
The tests were made to assess the applicability
of calculation methods proposed for determining
thermodynamic properties, including the wvapor
pressures, of solutions of interest to the vacuum-
distillation process for
water.”

The three sea-salt solutions were prepared to
simulate closely the ‘‘standard seawater’” defined
by K. S. Spiegler.® In order to avoid the evolution
of gases and possible corrosion in the vapor
chamber, the troublesome univalent anions HCOs‘
and Br™ were replaced by equivalent quantities of
chloride ion. Solution A was further modified by
replacing the calcium with magnesium, thereby
increasing the magnesium concentration to
0.06451 m; the sulfate concentration in solution A
was kept at 0.02856 m. Solution B was modified
further by completely removing the calcium to-
gether with an equivalent amount of sulfate; the
sulfate concentration in solution B was thus re-
duced to a concentration of 0.01822 m. Saline C
was not modified except by the replacement of
chloride for the bicarbonate and bromide. Thus,
the compositions of the three solutions were:

Four dishes of each solution, four dishes of NaCl

standard weights for internal calibration of the

with a larger dish containing NaCl solution which

evacuated from the sealed chamber, the apparatus
was brought to and held at 123°C. Each day, the
weights of every dish were recorded as readings
on an electrically operated magnetic balance,
after which a small amount of steam was vented
from the apparatus, thus increasing the concen-
trations of all the test, standard, and buffer solu-
tions. The changes in the concentrations of the
test solutions were inferred from the changes in
the weights of the dishes. The jonic strengths of
the solutions were then calculated from the formula

Plots of these equations, as shown in Fig. 13.2,
suggested that solution C was clearly different
in behavior from solutions A and B. The con-~
siderable overlap between solutions A and B
suggested that a more sensitive test could be
made of the possible significance of any dif-
ference between them. To this end, the hypothesis
was made that the solutions did not differ, and
a t test was applied to the 26 values of I, — IB
obtained from the data in Table 13.2. An average
value of the difference found was 0.077 unit of
ionic strength (not units of R); this difference

was found to be well above the 0.001 level of
significance.

Marshall al.” have recently shown that
calcium sulfate should begin to precipitate from
seawater at about 117°C. Therefore, it is likely
that all the tests with solution C were performed
in the presence of solid CaSO, (anhydrite) and
that, consequently, the data for solution C should
not be suitable for analysis until and unless
accurate values for the solubility of the com-
ponents make it possible to infer the true solu-
tion composition. It may be noted, however, that
the values of R calculated from the true solution
composition should be higher than those plotted
in Fig. 13.2, probably bringing the data more
closely in line with those of solutions A and B.
The difference between A and B was observed
to be quite consistent over the whole concentra-
tion range, and the average value of this dif-
terence, 0,077 ionic strength unit, is about twice
the value calculated for the solutions as made up
at room temperature, 0.0414. The solubilities of

the components of solutions A and B have not
yet been determined as a function of concentration,
and it is still assumed that no precipitation took
place in the dishes containing these solutions.

With respect to the original objective, that of
testing the proposed method of calculating vapor
pressures of saline waters, solutions A and B
may not be sufficiently different to permit good
evaluation of such a method. Further tests should
be made with solutions known to be phase stable
at elevated temperatures and probably should
begin with simpler systems such as those con-
taining mixtures of NaCl and Na2SO4 or mixtures
of NaCl and MgCl1,.

ALUMINUM- AND TITANIUM-ALLOY CORROSION
IN SALINE WATERS AT ELEVATED
TEMPERATURES

E. G. Bohlmann

F. A. Posey®
J. F. Winesette

The studies of the corrosion of aluminum and
titanium alloys in sodium chloride solutions have
continued. They have included investipations in
the 100-gpm titanium loops,® the small titanium
efectrochemical loop,'? and conventional labora~
tory equipment. It was found necessary to modify
the electrode assembly in the small titanium loop
to reduce troublesome IR drops; this entailed
ptoviding coaxial polarizing electrodes and dual
reference electrodes as shown in Fig. 13.3.

Galvanostatic polarization studies of the cor-
rosion of the 5454 (27% Mg, 0.8% Mn, 0.1% Cr,
<0.01% Cu) and 6061 (1.0% Mg, 0.6% Si, 0.25% Cu,
0.25% Cr) aluminum alloys in 1 M NaCl at 150°C
have been catried out in this equipment.!! The
results obtained were generally similar to those
obtained by other workers at lower temperatures.
Thus, a pronounced minimum exists in the cor-
rosion rate of aluminum and its alloys in chloride
solutions in the vicinity of neutrality. Changes

with pH in the polarization curves of anodic and
cathodic processes occurting at the aluminum-
electrolyte interface provide a kinetic basis for
understanding this and other aspects of the cor-
rosion behavior. At low potentials, the rate of
the anodic or corrosion reaction is independent of
the electrode potential, but it increases with
increasing pH. The rate of the anodic process is
controlled by the rate of mass transport of hy-
droxide ions to the oxide-solution interface. At
higher potentials, in the presence of chloride
ions, the anodic-polarization curve exhibits a
pitting potential which independent of the
anodic current density. The pitting potential
does not vary with pH, but decreases with in-
creasing chloride concentration. The cathodic
reaction in alkaline solution consists of the re-
duction of water molecules to {form molecular
hydrogen; this process is pH independent. With
increasing acidity, reduction of hydrogen ions be-

18

comes increasingly important. The minimum cor-~
rosion rate represents a compromise between the
decrease in the rate of the transport-controlled
anodic reaction with increasing acidity and the
increase in the rate of the cathodic hydrogen-
evolution reaction. Oxygen in solution may also
increase the corrosion rate by providing an addi-
tional cathodic process.

Comparison of polarization curves of the 5454
and 6061 alloys shows that the rate of the cathodic
hydrogen-evolution reaction of the 6061 alloy is
considerably greater than that of the 5454 alloy.
The enhanced rate of the cathodic process on the
6061 alloy accounts for its greater corrosion rate
at any pH and for its susceptibility to pitting
attack. Catalysis of the cathodic process on the
6061 alloy may be attributable to its copper
content. It is hypothesized that accumulation of
copper at the metal-oxide interface as corrosion
progresses results in pit formation.

These studies stemmed from results obtained
in the 100-gpm titanium loops, which showed
gross pitting of 6061 alloy specimens after 248-hr
exposure to pH 6.0, 1 ¥ NaCl at 150°C. Under
comparable conditions, the 5454 alloy showed
uniform attack after 1620-hr exposure; continuing
corrosion rates were "~ 6 mils/year at 7 to 25 fps.
Similar results are being cbtained at 100°C; 6061
specimens show pitting attack after 500 to 1500
hr, whereas 5454 specimens show uniform attack
with continuing corrosion rates of ~1 mil/year
atter ~2800-hr exposure,

the specimens are exposed to near-normal con-
centration, pH ~7.5 brine (sulfuric acid treated
and neutralized for scale prevention) at 129 to
138°C. Racks have been examined at 12-, 32a,
and 82-day intervals and have all shown negligible
to severe attack in areas of contact with Teflon;
no attack was observed in metal-to-metal contact
areas., This was consistent with the previously
noted promotion of attack by contact with Teflon.
It appears likely that this results from the release
of small amounts of fluoride ion!? by the Teflon.
Anodic polarization studies have shown that as
little as 12 ppm fluoride substantially increases
the active corrosion rate and the rate of activation
of titanium.

It is also likely that the absence of more general
attack on the rack specimens stemmed from the
somewhat low temperature of exposure — the bulk
of the exposure was at temperatures less than
138°C. The previously noted dominant importance

of temperature was reemphasized by recent ex-
perience with 100-gpm titanium-loop piping. For-
mation of several large pits was observed during
operation at temperature 2150°C. Subsequently,
the loop has been operated at 100°C for ~2800 hr
with no apparent further attack. A similar pit
initiated in another part of the loop penetrated the
0.2-in. pipe wall after approximately 5400 hr at
150°C and after 300 hr at 200°C, 1!

A particularly significant point conceming the
very sharp temperature dependence has just been
discovered. This is that the breakdown or pitting
potential for titanium, reported as ~10 v in room-
temperature chloride solutions,!® has a very sharp
temperature dependence.  Studies in the small
titanium electrochemical loop showed pitting po-
tentials at plus 500 mv (vs S.C.E.) or less for
commercially pure titanium at temperatures of
150°C and above. Laboratory and loop electro-
chemical studies have shown this sharp tempera-
ture dependence over the range 25 to 190°C. The
actual potentials measured and temperature de-
pendence, however, are greatly influenced by
alloy composition and surface condition, so no
quantitative data will be presented at this time.

The tendency of seawater to deposit scale in

range and brine~concentration factor of the process
and affects the efficiency. The problem
economic: scale control costs probably should
not exceed a few cents per 1000 gal. This elimi-
pnates many technologically feasible processes,
unless salable by-products are produced.

Raw-materials costs alone appear to be too high
for most processes except those using compounds
of carbon or sulfur. Sulfuric acid addition is
conventionally used to prevent the formation of
calcium carbonate or magnesium hydroxide scale
and permits operation up to temperatures near
250°F. Calcium sulfate may precipitate above
this temperature.

The prevention of alkaline scale in seawater
heaters by means of carbon dioxide additions
has been supgested. Ellis'* observed the effect
of carbon dioxide pressure on the solubility of
calcite in various sodium chloride solutions at
elevated temperatures. Thermodynamic equilibrium
constants and mean activity coefficients of cal-
cium and bicarbonate ions were reported. We
adapted these findings to the composition and
alkalinity of standard seawater, assuming that
the solutions and activity coefficients are similar
at equal ionic strengths. It was thus estimated
that the addition of 0.9 1b of CO, per 1000 gal
of seawater feed, corresponding to a CO, partial
pressure of .09 atm at 25°C, might prevent
calciie precipitation up to 125%C (257°F). In a
once-through flash-evaporator system, alkaline
scale would precipitate in the brine bulk as
catbon dioxide flashed in the first stage. Heating
surfaces would not be fouled, and C02 might be
recycled without compressors.

Data were not available permitting consideration
of magnesium hydroxide precipitation.

The assumption that seawater resembles sodium
chloride solutions of equal ifonic strength neg-
lected consideration of ion-pair formation. The
chemical model of seawater at 25°C of Garrels!®
and Thompson showed a significant degree of

association of sulfate, bicarbonate, and carbonate
jong with magnesium and sodium and also with
ions. Our preliminary estimates for
100°C have indicated that magnesium sulfate pair
formation will be greater at the increased tempera-
ture. Calcium sulfate is similatly affected to a
lesser extent. These phenomena may also affect
the application to seawater problems of the studies
of Marshall, Slusher, and Jones!® on the solu-
bility of calcium sulfate in sodium chloride solu-

calcium

tions.

The economic removal of calcium sulfate
scaling tendencies may be possible by thermal
precipitation techniques in which seawater is
heated to a temperature of calcium sulfate super-
saturation; precipitation may be facilitated by
contacting with calcium sulfate particles. An
understanding of ionic and solubility equilibria
and precipitation kinetics are needed to provide
a rational basis for an economic process using
this technique.

The rate of precipitation from a supersaturated
solution is affected by mass transfer to the crystal
surface, reaction with surface sites, and nu-
cleation of new particles. Without nucleation, the
rate cannot exceed that of mass transfer. Co-
efficients for mass transfer to particles were
related by Harriott!? to that for a single freely
falling sphere in the given liquid. The coefficient
decreases as particle size increases up to about
100 ;2 and changes little thereafter. For anhydrite
crystallization from standard seawater with about
10°F superheating, we estimated that the mass-
transfer limitation would permit growth rates up
to several centimeters per hour. Such rates would
permit an effective unit for removing calcium sul-
fate from seawater to be designed.

Neilsen!? has indicated that, as supersaturation
is decreased and the surface reaction becomes
limiting, crystallization rates decrease more than
the concentration by a substantial proportion.
On the other hand, if the concentration is in=-
creased and high levels of supersaturation are
reached, undesirably rapid nucleation is to be
anticipated. Thus, the supersaturation must be

fer for the most effective operation of “‘contact-
stabilization’ equipment.

In addition to capital and heat costs of the
contact-stabilization process, pumping-energy costs
may be appreciable. At higher temperatures, a
higher head is required in order to pressurize the

120

feed to prevent boiling. For example, at 330°F
the vapor pressure of water is 103 psi, and about
1 kwhr is required to pump 1000 gal of feed
against this head. The maximum economic tem-
perature is thus limited by the exponential rise
in vapor pressure.

EFFECT OF RADIATION ON POLYMERS

W. W. Parkinson W. K. Kirkland
R. M. Keyser

Polytetrafluorcethylene (Tetlon) degrades at very
moderate radiation doses in air, but it has been
found to show much less sensitivity when irradi-
ated in an inert atmosphere ot vacuum. 1.2 Because
of the usefulness of Teflon in deleterious environ-
ments and because the films used in previous
work ? would be extremely sensitive to atmosphere,
sheet stock of 1[3,) and 1/6 in. thickness has been
investigated. Tensile specimens have been ir-
radiated at about 25°C in air and vacuum over
a range of doses up to 7 x 107 rads. Tensile
properties were measured in air at room tempera-
ture. The specimens in vacuum were outgassed
at 5 > 107° torr and 140°C and sealed in glass
capsules. The dose rate was 1.2 x 10° rads /hr.

The tfensile properties of the 1/1 ;-in. sheet ir-
radiated in air and in vacuum are plotted vs dose
in Fig. 14.1. It is significant that in vacuum the
tensile strength decreases to 40-45% of its orig-
inal value at 2 x 10° tads but remains almost
constant from this dose to perhaps 10° rads or
more, It is seen that useful mechanical properties
are refained in an inert atmosphere to doses in
excess of 3 » 107 rads. In air both the "/16- and

1/$,)=-ixl.-t}1i(:1': specimens retain 33% of their original
tensile strength at 10° rads, in contrast to the

films of the earlier work,? where the tensile

strength decreased to very low values in this
dose range.

The maximum in the elongation at break, ob-
served in the 1/32--1'.11. as well as the 1/1 gmin. spec-
imens, is interesting in the light of “zero strength
time’’ measurements, demonstrating that scission
predominates at doses above 10% rads.® Probably,
radiation-induced defects in the crystal structure,
indicated by a minimum in the density-dose curve
at 10? rads,® increase the ductility and account
for the maximum in the elongation.

The effect of strong bases on reactions involving
ionic intermediates in irradiated hydrocarbons has
been demonstrated recently.® These results have
led us to search for amines in the radiolysis
products from solutions of ammonia in n-hexane
and in hexene-1. Solutions for irradiation were
prepared by condensing known amounts of an-
hydrous ammonia into deaerated samples of n-
hexane and hexene-l.
most solutions were of the order of 2 to 3 mole %,
which is about the limit of ammonia solubility

ADDITION REACTIONS OF FURAN
DERIVATIVES

Polar organic compounds have been observed to
add to olefinic groups in chain reactions initiated
by chemically produced free radicals or ionic
intermediates.  Such chain reactions offer the
possibility of the high vyields required for com-
utilization of the radiation from radio-
isotopes. Materials which may be candidates for
upgrading through such reactions are the furan
derivatives. The preducts, hicyelic and tricyclic
ethers, would be useful for solvents and for further
processing into chelating agents, surface-active

mercial

agents, ete.

A survey is being performed of the radiation-
induced addition of saturated furan and similar
ethers to unsaturated furan denvatives and al-
kenes. Compounds which have been investigated
are listed in Table 14.1 and grouped as saturated
compounds (telogens) and unsaturated compounds.

The telogen was present in greater concentration
in the mixtures since it was desired to promote
the formation of 1:1 telomers in the reactions

Solutions containing 2-methyltetrahydrofuran were
studied over a range of concentrations and doses
since the hydrogen abstraction, step (3), proceeds
with greater ease in the case of a tertiary hy-
drogen.

The chromatographic analyses show that con-
siderable guantities of products are formed in
the molecular-weight range of dimers and simple
telomers. The results for solutions of dihydro-
furan in Z-methvltetrahydrofuran indicate that the
major product changes trom a dimer or 1:1 adduct
to a trimer or 1:2 adduct when the dose exceeds
about 8 x 107 rads. Increasing the concentration
of dihydrofuran in the solution favors the lower-
molecular-weight product at the higher doses.

2-methyltetrahydrofuran in both dihydrofuran and
cyclohexene suggests that tetrahydrofuran gives
higher yields than the 2-methyl compound.

Evaporation of the irradiated mixtures indicated
that over 20% of the original materials had been
converted to nonvolatile residue at doses of about
4 % 10® rads. Initial yields in terms of consump~
tion of dihydrofuran in mixtures with methyltetra-
hydrofuran were estimated at G values (molecules
per 100 ev) of about 10.

Infrared spectra indicated the formation of small
quantities of hydroxy and carbonyl compounds.
Mixtures of telogens with furan and 2 5-dimethyl-
furan gave very little 1:1 or higher telomer,
probably because of resonance stabilization of the
furan ring.

Further work will involve identifying the products
indicated by gas chromatography and measurement
of yields at elevated temperatures.
15. Fluoride Studies for Other ORNL Programs

THE CHEMISTRY OF CHROMIUM IN THE
FLUORIDE VOLATILITY PROCESS

B. J. Sturm R. E. Thoma

In earlier versions of the Fluoride Volatility
Process, volatile UF _ was obtained by fluorina-
tion of fluoride melts in which solid fue!l elements
had been dissolved by treatment with HF. For
zirconium-’ aluminum-based® fuel elements
the method worked well because the available low-
melting salt mixtures permitted the fluorination
at temperatures of 600°C or lower, where corrosion
was not severe. Fuel elements with matrices and
claddings of stainless steel proved less tractable;
a process in which UF _ is recovered by volatiliza-
tion from a fluidized bed instead of a melt® looks
promising for these fuels. Uranium hexafluoride
from both processes is purified by adsorption-
desorption cycles on beds of NaF,

In the fluidized-bed procedure the fuel elements
are supported in a fluidized alumina powder, which
acts as a heat transfer medium, and are decom-
posed by treatment with HF-0, mixtures. Uranium
is then recovered as UF 5 by fluorination. When
chromium, an important constituent of stainless
steel, reacts with the HF-0O, mixture, it forms
nonvolatile oxides and fluorides. On fluorination,
chromium is oxidized to higher valence, and large
quantities of its volatile fluorides and oxyfluorides
form. These compounds might volatilize with
and contaminate the recovered UF , Little is
known of these volatile compounds of chromium,

might be used for synthesizing CeF,. In laboratory
tests, we found that dense blue-black CiF, vapors
were evolved above 400°C, the boiling point of the
compound, when equimolar amounts of the re-

actants were present or when there was an excess
of AgF .

form melted reproducibly at 1090°C and exhibited
a range of solid-solution stoichiometry, The low-
temperature form is biaxial, with an average re-
fractive index of 1.411. X-ray diffraction pattems
from 5NaF~3CrF3 powder suggest that the coms

morphous with chiolite (5NaF=3A1F3). In the

Behavior of Cr02F2

Chromium oxyfluoride has been prepared® by
reaction of CoF, and CrO, and has been exposed
in the vapor state for 0.5 hr at 80°C to several of
the materials expected to contact the Fluoride
Volatility Process gas streams. Sodium fluoride
reacted with the CrO I, to produce an (as yet
unidentified) yellow-orange compound. Aluminum
fluoride, UF,, and UO, showed no evidence of
reaction.

Equilibrium data’~? for the reaction

2HF () + Cr0,(s) & CrO,F (&) + H,0(8)

suggest that AG for solid CrO,F, at 298°K should
be near — 189 kcal/mole. From this value one
predicts that CrOF should oxidize CeF, to CrF,
uo, to UO,, and (by 2 kcal per gram atom of F)
UF, to UF,. No tests of the first two reactions
have been made; UF4 was not oxidized to UF5
during the relatively mild exposures above.

and apparatus required for the production of very
pure, large (350 g) single crystals of LilF with
selected isotopic ratios. In a previous report10 we
indicated that by refinement of standardized
techniques’! for preparing lithium fluoride single
crystals, we could routinely produce such crystals
in which metallic impurity concentration does not
exceed 30 ppb. Crystals were grown from molten
LiF in capsules of grade ‘A’ nickel, The single
contaminant detected in the LiF product by the
best analytical methods available is manganese,
its source is the nickel capsule wall, from which
Mn® and/or Mn2* diffuse into the melt.

The principal application of these LiF crystals
has been; in testing theoretical models telating
the variation of the thermal conductivity of the
crystals with their ®Li-71.i ratio. For this purpose,
workers at the Cornell Materials Science Center!?
have found that crystals must be sufficiently pure
that the impurity does not mask the isotopic effect.
While adequate for most studies which require
very pure crystals of LiF, material which contains
as much as 1 ppm Mn?" is insufficiently pure for
testing theoretical models under consideration.

Controlled Thermonuclear Research Program

R. A. Strehlow

Whether controlled thermonuclear devices with
useful power densities are feasible is a question
which can be conveniently divided into two prin-
cipal parts. The first part asks whether a plasma
fuel element can be constructed; that is, whether

the physics of plasma confinement can be solved’

in a practical way. The second part, which is more
obscure, asks whether there is any fundamental
bar {o construction of a thermonuclear reactor if
the confinement problem is solvable. We have
continued to study chemical aspects of both parts
of this question.

Our studies in support of the confinement prob-
lems are directed toward development of tech-
niques to diagnose the quality of the plasma
environment in experimental devices and to assist
in attempts to improve this quality. Such pursuits
have dominated our chemical studies.!'™® In addi-
tion, an extensive literature survey and an experi-
mental study have been devoted to possible prob-
lems of fritium inventory and the fuel cycle of a
thermonuclear reactor. Some of our special equip-
ment was also used to assist in the design (by
ORNL Isotopes Division personnel) of an isotope
separator of a new and improved type. Each of
these portions of our effort is described briefly
in the following.

YACUUM ANALYSIS IN AN EXPERIMENTAL
PLASMA DEVICE

R. A, Strehlow

A simple mass-spectrometric assembly has been
installed and operated routinely to yield a continu-
ing record of vacuum conditions during operation
of the plasma device DCX-2. About 2500 mass
spectta have been obtained in this study since
installation of this residual-gas analyzer in Feb-
ruary 1965. Such data have proved helpful in
assaying various pumping and operating parameters
of DCX-2; such species as acetylene, trichloro-
ethylene, methane, ethane, alcohols, and vapors
of metals (such as Zn) can be detected unambig-
uously. The mass spectra alone are insufficient
to yield a real diaguosis of the DCX-2 vacuum
environments since, in many cases, the origin of
the observed species is more important than the
fact of its presence. Accordingly, a study is under
way of the effect of processes within DCX-2 upon
the mass spectrum obtained from pertinent materials.

For this study a second mass-analyzer assembly,
similar to that on DCX-2, has been installed on a
simple, large vacuum system whose construction
materials, assembly methods, pumps, pump .oils,
etc., are similar to those of DCX-2. This assembly
pemmits study of the effects of various analyzer
instrument parameters (electron-~accelerating volt-
age and ion-source assembly procedure, for example)
on the spectrum observed. More important, how-
ever, it permits study of the effect of processes
such as electron and ion bombardment, temperature
fluctuations, titanium getter evaporation, and
others used in DCX-2 on the mass spectrum ob-
served.

With this assembly, mass-spectrometric studies
have been made of the effect of warming liquid-
nitrogen-cooled surfaces,'*? of hot-filament reac-
tions and electron bombardment of contaminated
surfaces,? and of reactions of titanium in vacuum
systems,®> Recent studies have dealt with the
formation of products from bombardment with hydro-
gen ions during glow discharges within the as-
sembly. These studies suggest that acetylene is
observed, in addition to methane, only when a
trisiloxane oil is present in the bombarded materials.
Acetylene, previously observed in DCX-2 during
ion injection of I12+ into the assembly, is now be-
lieved to be evidence of contamination by this
pump-oil component,

INTERACTION OF TRITIUM WITH
THERMONUCLEAR-REACTOR MATERIALS

S. S. Kirslis

For a thermonuclear reactor to be feastble, the
holdup of tritium in the metal of the containment
vessel (probably molybdenum or tungsten) and in
that of the ion sources (alloys of nickel or iron)
must not result in excessive tritium inventory and
decay losses. The equilibrium solubility of hydro-
gen in these metals at low pressures is low. How-
ever, the metals can be cathodically ‘‘surcharged”’
with hydrogen to amounts of the order of 100 c¢m?
(NTP)/g; this is sufficient to cause, in some
cases, blistering and cracking of the metal. In
order to judge more clearly whether the metal in
a reactor under bombardment by energetic tritium
atoms might be surcharged with tritium, a literature
study of the various possible surface and interior
diffusion processes has been made; this survey
will be published separately.

The 50- to 100-kev
pected to penetrate the metal to their range depth
of 1 to 2 x 107* cm. They presumably diffuse
inward (and also back to the entrance surface)
according to normal diffusion laws. If there is
no appreciable barrier to their egress at the sur-

tritium atoms may be ex-

face, the concentration of tritium atoms just in-
side the metal will be low or zero. If all this is
true, the steady-state concentration of tritium in

the metal will have a peak at the range depth and
will fall off to low values at the bombarded sur-
face and at the far surface of the metal. The
average concentration in the metal would be half
the peak concentration. If a barrier to egress of
tritium from the bombarded surface exists, the
whole steady-state concentration curve would cor-
respondingly rise to higher tritium concentrations,
The factors determining the peak concentration of
tritium are the flux of atoms to the metal, the dif-
fusion constant of tritium in the metal, and the
boundary condition for the degassing of the bom-
barded metal surface.

Information on hydrogen ditffusion in the metals
of interest was derived mainly f{rom published
permeability and solubility studies. For informa-
tion on the degassing boundary condition, the
literature was searched in the fields of chemisorp-
tion and desorption, catalysis, hydrogen-electrode
behavior, and hydrogen-atom recombination, Other
peitinent information was obtained from published
studies of ion bombardment, spuftering of metal
surfaces, and saturation of metals by proton or
deuteron bombardment.

The conclusions of the literature study are as
follows:

1. Hydiogen is easily degassed at low pressures
and moderate temperatures, even from metals
(such as tungsten) for which the chemisorption
heats are high.

Cathodic surcharging depends on the poisoning
of the metal surface for hydrogen-atom recombi-
nation. In a gaseous environment on clean
metals, hydrogen-atom recombination is rapid.
Diffusion rates for hydrogen in molybdenum at
600 to 800°C are sufficiently rapid to deliver
injected atoms rapidly back to the bombarded
surface, thus maintaining a very low (and from
a practical viewpoint, negligible) concentration
of hydrogen in the metal, The same is expected
to be true for tritium. If the hydrogen concen-
tration will indeed be as low as estimated from
the simple diffusion model, it should cause no
hydrogen embrittlement problems. Since the
diffusion constants for nickel and iron are much
higher than those of molybdenum, high internal
hydrogen concentrations are not expected even
at much lower temperatures.

Some recent work on deuteron bombardment of
metals indicates higher of
deuterium just inside the metal surface than

concentrations
129

predicted by the simple model. Some evidence
indicates this may be the effect of surface
contamination on the metal,

HYDROGEN SURCHARGING OF MOLYBDENUM
IN A GLOW DISCHARGE

D. M. Richardson

A study of hydrogen occlusion by a molybdenum
cathode in a glow discharge has been conducted.
The principal objective of this work was to assess
the significance of hydrogen surcharging to design
considerations for themmonuclear reactors. Initial
studies had indicated a possible hydrogen content
of one or more atmospheric cubic centimeters per
cubic centimeter of metal after bombardment in a
discharge. Though this concentration of hydrogen
is less than 0.1 at. %, even this low value could,
if it were typical of the concentration in a large
fraction of the reactor, present serious problems
to the reactor designer. The work described here
and the literature study summarized above, how-
ever, have led to the conclusion that, at elevated
temperatures, occlusion of hydrogen is not large.
At lower temperatures it appears that surface
contamination can matkedly impede the recombina~
tion of hydrogen during even low-enetgy bombard-
ment; very high hydrogen concentrations in the
metal are able, therefore, to be achieved.

For these studies, a 45-cm length of molybdenum
wire 1 mm in diameler was used as a cathode in a
cylindrical tank with a volume of 200 liters. The
ends of the tank were electrically shielded with
sheet Teflon, The center of the tank was cone
nected to a vacuum system through a 6-in. isolation
gate valve and a gate valve with a small orifice
which had a speed of 2 x 107* the speed of the
vacunm-system manifold., This allowed a steady
introduction of hydrogen gas through a palladium
leak to the glow discharge chamber at a pressure
of 1072 to 1 torr with continuous mass analysis
of the effluent gas from this chamber. The gas
during the usual discharge contained not more than
1 part per thousand of nonhydrogen impurity.

The conditions for the usual low-temperature
discharge are summarized in Table 16.1. The total
bombardment for the conditions shown was 12
amp-sec or about 1 to 3 atm-cm® of hydrogen gas.
After opening the valve and pumping down to a

pressure of about 1 x 1077 torr, the wire was
heated to redness. Mass-spectrometric and ione
gage observations were made of the hydrogen
evolved by the depassing process. Pressute rises
of as much as 6 x 10™* torr were observed during
the 4-sec degassing procedure, Since the system
pumping speed for hydrogen was about 1000 liters/
sec, this pressure rise corresponded to about 2
atm-cm® of hydrogen,

Stringent cleaning of the wire and ion bombard-
ment of the chamber walls for several hours, fol-
lowed by repetition of the discharge, led to a value
of only 0.017 atm-cm®. Continued repetitions of
the discharge-degas cycle led to increasing amounts
of hydrogen being occluded. Since the wire was
not heated past 1000°C, a gradual increase in
surface contamination could have been responsible
for the very high values.

Several attempts were made at higher current
densities (and consequent high temperatures) to
determine the amount of hydrogen occluded during
a usual discharge. None of these attempts led to
an evolution of hydrogen in detectable amounts,

Molybdenum surfaces which are clean or which
are heated do not seem to occlude large quantities
of hydrogen during low~intensity bombardment
with protons,

MEASUREMENT OF GAS LOAD FROM SOURCE
OF ELECTROMAGNETIC SEPARATOR

R. A. Stehlow

Scientists of the ORNL Isotopes Division are
designing an improved electromagnetic isotope
separator. This separator, a considerably modified
calutron, is to have separate differential pumping
systems for the source, collector, and main-vacuums-
tank regions. For design of these pumping systems,
130

it was necessary to know the gas load upon each;
that from the source was judged to require experi-
mental measurement.

ORNL electromagnetic separators use, where
possible, vapor of the chloride of the element
whose isotopes are to be separated., This chloride
is generated within the source assembly by chlori-
nation with CCl, of the appropriate metal or oxide.
The gas load from the source assembly, therefore,
consists almost entirely of unreacted CCl1 .

A flow-rate meter with a constant (regulated)
pressure and variable volume, capable of operation
with condensable pases and at low pressures, was
adapted for this study., This device, designed to
measure flow rates as low as 10™° torr-liter/min
for the thermonuclear support propram, was installed
near the source region of a calutron. The CCI4
flow rate from this unit was monitored during a run
in which the isotopes of cerium were being sep-
arated. The measured flow rate, higher by nearly
an order of magnitude than that previously esti-
mated, has been used in design of the differential
pumping system for the source of the new unit,

hope to assist in interpreting mass spectra from
such halide vapors by determining appearance
potentials of the various ions formed by electron

has been completed with the construction of a

the study, with a time-of-flight mass spectrometer,
This
assessment was considered necessary, even though
application of retarding-potential-difference methods

to this type of spectrometer has been demonstrated,
to determine whether gases introduced at the low
pressures corresponding to the expected flux of
salt-vapor species would yield appearance poten-~

were obtained from ionization-efficiency curves,
normalized for this systematic deviation at onset,
obtained in the standardization with krypton.
Typical normalized ionization-efficiency plots are
shown in Fig. 16.1 for krypten and ethane frag-

are compared in Table 16.2 with those obtained
by others. We fail to check the published values
for the C2H4+ and C21-15+ fragments from butane,
but agree quite satisfactorily with published values
for all others studied.

Since the operating source pressure was main-
tained at 5 x 1077 to 1 x 107 % torr in these studies,
we believe that vapor fluxes from effusion cells
containing metal halides will prove adequate for
the planned investigation. It is likely that temper-
ature control of the effusion-cell system will be
of prime importance,

Behavior on Melting in Steam

Analysis of two experiments which used atmos-
pheres of 1000 psia steam (285°C) has been re-
ported elsewhere.? One experiment used a spec-
imen of UQ, with stainless steel cladding; during
exposure in TREAT the cladding melted, oxidized
extensively, slumped in a spongy mass, and ad-
hered to the unmelted UO, pellets. Fission product
release from fuel and cladding was much less
than that in an earlier experiment, which used
previously unirradiated stainless-steel-clad UO_ in
45-psi argon atmosphere, where the cladding flowed
completely off of the unmelted U0, pellets. Appar-
ently, the layer of oxidized cladding formed by the

high-pressure steam provided an effective barrier
to fission product release.

The second experiment nsed a specimen with
Zircaloy-2 cladding on the UO, fuel; after the

exposure, fuel and cladding were found to be
fragmented and dispersed within the alumina
crucible. Direct comparison of fission product

release from the stainless-steel- and the Zircaloy-
clad specimens cannot be made since plugged
tubing prevented release of steam from the auto-
clave after the transient with the Zircaloy-clad
specimen. However, the distribution of fission
ptoducts within the fuel autoclave showed that
the release was greater for the Zircaloy-clad
specimen; this must be considered at present to

be a result of the fragmentation.

Behovior on Melting Under Water

The first two of a series of experiments have
been performed with the TREAT reactor in order
to study the release of fission products from fuel
melted underwater. The experiments used stainless-
steel- and Zircaloy-2-clad UQ, fuel specimens
irradiated to 18 Mwd/metric ton. Aninitial specimen
temperature of 70°C was used, and operating and
reactor-transient conditions for the two experiments
were identical. Heat input to the fuel during the
transients. was approximately 500 cal per gram of
UO2 (50‘?0: greater than any previously used); the
U0, was heated to well above its melting point.

The experiments were designed to simulate tran-
sient accidents with water-cooled reactors in which
steam and water are expelled from the core vessel.
Valves were opened immediately after the transient,
and the transient-generated steam and a purge of
argon gas were permitted to flow through a con-
denser, water-collection traps, filters, and a
charcoal bed into a gas-collection tank. The fuel-
containing autoclave was then electrically heated
136

to 350°C maximum for 1 hr to slowly boil excess . 2 . o vesers
water out of the fuel autoclave. '
The release and distribution of fission products
were essentially the same in the two experiments.
The fuel specimens melted completely (Figs. 17.1
and 17.2). Fission product release to the fuel
autoclave was high, but transport of fission products
out of the autoclave by steam release and argon
purge was relatively small. The '?°Te, '*7Cs,
and 13! carried out of the fuel autoclave ranged
from 2 to 7%. The transported release of non-
volatile materials (°°Zr, '*'Ce, and UO ) was
only 0.1%. Approximately 0.005% of the 311
reached the filter papers and charcoal bed.

137

Most of the transient-generated steam condensed
in the fuel autoclave, and only a small amount
was immediately discharged through the condenser.
The water inside the fuel autoclave was an excellent
trap for the fission products since slow evapora-
tion of the remaining water (simulating accident
after-heat) did not transport large amounts of
fission products. Approximately 1 liter of hydrogen
was produced in each experiment by reaction
between c¢ladding and water; this resulted in a
chemically reducing atmosphere for most fission
products.

Metallographic examination of portions of the
melted fuel samples showed the formation of a
eutectic phase in the specimen with stainless
steel cladding. The major phase in the sample
from the Zircaloy-2-clad specimen was a solid
solution of approximately 75% UO, and 25% Zr:()z.

Two additional experiments were recently per-
formed with fuel specimens and reactor transients
similar to those described above. The initial
temperature was increased and the argon purge was
eliminated in order to have quicker and more com-
plete release of steam from the fuel autoclave in
the first minute following the transients. Examina-
tion of these experiments is in progress.

attainment of controlled temperatures (through
nuclear heating of the small fuel specimen) to and
above the melting point of UO, with any of sev-
eral atmospheres. The release and the subsequent
deposition of eight fission products (I, Te, Cs, Ru,
Sr, Ba, Zr, and Ce) are determined in each of the
experiments. Results of these investigations are
published in detail elsewhere. ”

The atmospheres that have been investigated
include helium, moist helium, steam-helium-hydro-
gen mixtures, dry air, moist air, and steam-air
mixtures, Of the eight elements measured, only
iodine and ruthenium showed significant variations
in behavior with changes in atmosphere. lodine
and ruthenium were both more volatile in a moist
air than in any other atmosphere studied and were
transported farther under these conditions. lodine
passed through absolute filters but was retained
on charcoal; ruthenium was more easily filtered
in the volatile form (from moist air) than in the
less volatile form. Ruthenium was not volatile
in an atmosphere containing appreciable guantities
of steam. The release of cesium from the 1000°C
zone was lowest in experiments in which steam
was a component of the atmosphere.

Cladding material near the heated fuel is an
abundant, strongly reducing reagent and can be
expected to affect fission product behavior. Stain-
less steel appears to retain ruthenium and, under
oxidizing conditions, to lower the melting point
of UO,. Experiments with Zircaloy cladding are
in progress. Out-of-pile experiments* on the
effects of stainless steel and Zircaloy cladding
have shown that the efficiency of trapping iodine
by steam condensation is increased by the presence
of these materials.

Three experiments have been performed to study
the effect of high burnup of fuel (>>20,000 Mwd/ton)
on fission product behavior. Suchfuel was examined
metallographically and was found to be typical
of high-burnup fuel used in power reactors of
advanced design. Cesium and ruthenium were the
only elements affected by burnup; the fractional
release of ruthenium decreased with increasing
burnup, while that of cesium increased.

Effects of maximum temperature of the fuel are

also being investigated. In these experiments,

performed under oxidizing conditions in which the
maximum fuel temperature was maintained at ap-
proximately 2000°C, the UO  appeared to have
melted due to the formation of a [ow-melting eutectic
with stainless steel oxide. The releases of the
eight elements in such intermediate-temperature
experiments were similar to releases in experiments
in which complete melting occurred at approximately
2900°C. Future experiments are planned at less
than 2000°C and under reducing conditions.

The primary purpose of these in-pile experiments
is, of course, to permit prediction of behavior of
the fission products in possible reactor accidents
with reasonably assumed conditions. Accordingly,
assessment of the form and the physical and
chemical characteristics of the released materials
is an essential part of the program.

two size ranges are important in transport of fission
product activity. Analysis by composite diffusion

The aging of fission product aerosols following
release from the fuel may substantially alter the

experiments with this extended facility will treat

In the first experiment of a series designed
piimarily to test the effect of burnup on release
and behavior of fission products, a re-irradiated
specimen of stainless-steel-clad UO, previously
irradiated to 1000 Mwd/ton was melted in the
Containment Mockup Facility (CMF).® The specimen
was melted by induction heating in a steam-air
atmosphere; the released fission products were
aged in a stainless steel tank filled with pres-
surized steam-air mixture.

Distributions of released ‘‘real’’ fission products
are compared in Table 17.1 with those for simulated
fission products from previous experiments in the
CMF. The comparison tends to validate the use
of simulated high-burnup UO  fuel. Deposition
of fission products before they reached the stainless
steel aging tank was probably affected by the
different furnace-tube geometry of this experiment

differences in the distribution of fission products
reaching the tank were noted. The volatile fission
products, lodine, cesium, and tellurium, were the
only activities other than rare pases reaching the
tank in significant amounts; a large fraction of
these activities remained on the tank wall or was
collected in the condensate after 3 hr aging in the
tank with gradually decreasing pressure and
temperature.

Two different types of samplers were used to
study concentrations of gas-borne activity in the
pressurized tank during the aging period. The
two samplers gave comparable results, and the
total airborne gamma activity (mainly from iodine,
cesium, and tellurium) indicated by these samplers
agreed well with gross-activity values from a
collimated ion chamber adjacent to the side of
the tank. Figure 17.3 shows the variation with
time in concentration of the various gas-borne
activities.

THE CONTAINMENT RESEARCH INSTALLATION

G. W. Parker W. J. Martin

A schematic diagram of the Containment Research
Instaliation (CRI) and a brief description of its
principal features were given in the previous
progress report.” All the major components of
the CRI have been received, and construction
is approaching completion. The primary simulation
vessel, equipped with external resistance heaters
(21-kw total capacity), has been mounted in the
hot cell, and the major piping between the furnace
and the containment vessel has been installed
(see Fig. 17.4).

Installation of the containment vessel has been
delayed by a warpage problem (now solved) that
temporarily prevented insertion of one of the re-
movable liners. The liners will be painted with
either an epoxy coating that is of interest to the
LOFT facility at the NRTS or with a Bakelite
coating of the type being considered for use in the
Containment Systems Ezxperiment at Hanford.

Stainless-steel-clad UO_ fuel specimens have
been successfully melted in the Containment Mockup
Facility using the pressurized induction furnace
arrangement that will be used in the CRI. Modifica-
tions of the furnace fittings to allow remote loading
and unloading of highly irradiated fuel are presently
being worked out. Wiring and instrumentation of
the CRI, involving instrument panels on two floor
levels, are about 75% complete.

Preliminary testing of the CRI is expected to
begin early in 1966. '

ANALYSIS OF PLANS FOR SCALE.UP
IN NUCLEAR SAFETY PROGRAM

C. E. Miller, Jr. W. E. Browning, Jr.
The Nuclear Safety Program of the United States
includes firm plans for large-scale experiments —
of which the LOFT!? is the most ambitious — in
which a reactor core would be destroyed and fis-
sion product release and behavior would be meas-
ured. Such experiments will be exceedingly complex
and costly and will, obviously, be few in number.
It will be essential, therefore, to gain from them
the maximum information possible and to be able —
with the help of well-designed smaller-scale
studies — to apply this information to possible
accidents under conditions other than those tested.
At the request of AEC Washington we have attempted
an evaluation of the research and development
program at ORNL and elsewhere and of the varicus
scaled-up experiments for which planning is firm.

11,12 are

As a result of this evaluation, two reports
in the final stages of preparation.

We conclude that experiments to study fission
product behavior in containment and in gas-cleaning
systems are well scaled over the range between
small laboratory experiments and LOFT, but that
experiments to study the release and the transport
of fission products from fuels are not well scaled,
We suggest that intermediate-scale experiments of
the otrder of 1 and 10% of the size of LOFT are

study fission product behavior in the primary
system following release.

We would propose for consideration four experi-
ments to bridge the pap between those described
in the previous sections of this chapter and the
LOFT assembly. These are:

A. Tests at 1% of LOFT power level:
1.

These would be melted in place by central-

Investigation of fission product release and

actor using a multiple-pin subassembly with
irradiated fuel pins. These would be melted
in place using nuclear heating induced by
the parent reactor.

B. Tests at 10% of LOFT power level:

l. Investigation of fission product release and
transport in the Containment Systems Exper-
iment'* primary simulator using a dummy

ity. These would be melted by nuclear
self-heating induced by neutrons from the
LOFT parent core.

Its relatively high volatility and its great bio-
logical hazard combine to make radioiodine a most
important fission product in nuclear safety con-
Elemental I, is relatively easy to
trap and hold; the great convenience and safety of
ambient-temperature activated-charcoal beds have
led to their general adoption for removing iodine
from air or gas streams. An increasing awareness,
however, that a significant fraction of the iodine
liberated in a nuclear accident might be present as
organic iodides (notably methyl iodide) which are
poorly retained by common activated charcoals
has caused concern in the field for several years.

Careful experiments have served only to con-
firm that methyl iodide is poorly retained by
standard charcoals under high humidity, Removal
of methyl iodide by Pittsburgh type PCB activated
charcoal, 12 x 30 mesh (unimpregnated for CH,I
reaction), was investigated at 24°C; gas chroma-
tography was used to determine the CHBI that
passed the bed. The inlet methyl iodide concen-
tration was varied (inversely with air velocity)
from 8 to 80 mg of CH,I per cubic meter of air to
provide a constant introduction rate, Time periods
over which useful removal efficiencies were ob-

gsiderations.

humidity near 100%, an air velocity of 100 fpm,
and a bed depth of 1 in., to about 100 hr for a
relative humidity of less than 3%, an air velocity of
10 fpm, and a bed depth of 3 in.**> Removal of
methyl iodide and of elemental iodine by a variety
of charcoals was investigated with the airecharcoal
system at around 100°C and with the air stream
about 80% saturated with steam. In these tests
the iodine which passed the bed was determined
by radioactivity measurements. Elemental iodine
was trapped with fairly high efficiency, but methyl
iodide was not. Both radiation detection and gas
chromatography were used to test a method based
on dehumidification for improving the efficiency
of methyl iodide removal from steam-air mixiures.
This method was observed to be successful but
would require a rather complex moisture-removal
sys;t*em.6

The recent obsetvation’ "2 that beds of a com-
mercial charcoal (Mine Safety Appliances Company
No. 85851) which is impregnated with several
percent by weight of iodine will effectively remove
methyl iodide is, therefore,

charcoals when impregnated with I, or KI are
equally effective, We confirmed the observations

Tests conducted with impregnated charcoal under
two different sets of conditions postulated for the

good retention values; changing the loading level
(weight of methyl iodide per gram of charcoal) over
a wide range had no significant effect on retention
efficiency. A comparison of the methyl iodide

Effect of Residence Time on Retention of Methy! lodide by Treated and Untreated Coconut Charcoal

methyl iodide trapping was confirmed at 24°C
and for relative humidities up to 71%, and the
mechanism was shown to be due to the exchange
reaction:

CH, Y114 12 7i(on charcoal) » CH, 1?71
+ *¥11(on charcoal) .

The charcoal, as received, contains a form of
iodine, and nonradioactive CH,I is observed emerg-
ing from the charcoal while it is trapping radio-
active CH,I. This charcoal was also found to
trap elemental iodine satisfactorily under the above
conditions.?  Further tests under more severe
conditions are planned.

The investigation of the possibility of impreg-
nating charcoal with chemicals that will react
with methyl iodide to form products retained within
the charcoal bed was done mostly by gas chroma-
tography. Tests were made at 24 to 25°C with
inorganic impregnants for relative humidities around
70% and with organic impregnants for relative
humidities ranging up to 100%. As previously
observed,!? piperidine and piperazine were found
to enhance considerably the retention of methyl
iodide by charcoal so impregnated. Results ob-
tained with several materials suggested by thermo-
chemical calculations as impregnants, such as
bromine, sodium bromate,
were rather encouraging,.

Gas chromatography has been applied to and
found to be very useful in the analysis of radio-
iodine-vapor samples. By using electron-capture
detectors, which are sensitive to organic halogen-
containing molecules, methyl iodide concentrations
of the order of 1 ppb can be measured. In the anal-
ysis of vapor from radioactive-iodine sources, a
number of unidentified peaks were often observed.
Since some of these peaks may have been due to
small amounts of extraneous impurities, such as
chloroform and fluorocarbons, and since there is con-
siderable variation in sensitivity between dif-
ferent compounds of iodine, there is need, on
for detection that is more specific,
Consequently, a radiation-detector arrangement was

constructed and installed so that it was in series
with the electron-capture detector with respect to
gas flow, In this manner, attention was focused
only on those compounds containing '3*'I, and
any interference by extraneous nonradioactive
organic substances present in the sample was
eliminated.

The gas chromatograph, equipped with dual
detection based on radiation and election capture,
was tested with samples of the vapor over an
iodine source that was prepared by the palladium

peaks by electron caplure and eight peaks by
radioactivity., = Three of the latter peaks were
identified as methyl, ethyl, and propyl iodides
with methyl iodide accounting for 62% of the
total radioactivity., As time permits, plans are
to accumulate a compilation of relative retention
times for a wide variety of iodine compounds.
This chromatograph was used to determine the
purity of radioactive methyl iodide sources used
in related studies. These sources, as far as their
radioactivity was concerned,

Characterization devices such as composite
diffusion tubes, fibrous-filter analyzeis, gas

chromatographs, and May packs are needed to
measure various forms of gas-borne fission products
in order to study and understand their behavior
under reactor accident conditions., High humidity
reduces the effectiveness of activated charcoal
for removing various species of radioiodine and
consequently interferes with the performances of
May packs and composite diffusion tubes which
contain charcoal components. Several techniques
have been investigated in an effort to reduce the
moisture effect in diffusion tubes. Heating the
tube to reduce the relative humidity and using

refrigerated condensers to remove moisture have
been only partially successful.’® Of several
desiccants which have been tested for drying the
air, Drierite (anhydrous calcium sulfate) appears
to be promising because of its minimal adsorption
of methyl iodide.!” An improved deposition pat=
tern for methyl iodide also has been obtained
under moist conditions by substitution of an todine-
impregnated the normal coconut-
charcoal lining of the diffusion tube.'”

Investigation of iodine behavior in May packs
under various conditions was continued. A test
of a volatile iodine sample in a May pack of the
type used in the Nuclear Safety Pilot Plant was
made with an ait-steam atmosphere at 100°C, 2 atm
absolute pressure, and 90% relative humidity.!®
In general, the behavior was similar to that of
composite diffusion tubes at the same conditions,
but before more precise comparisons can be made,
further experimentation will be required. A facility
for studying the behavior of normal and modified
May packs in moist atmospheres at elevated tem-
peratures is being constructed,

Gas chromatography with dual detection (electron
capture and radiation) has been successfully ap-
plied in the analysis of various radioactive~iodine

A comparison of the deposition of various iodine-
vapor species in a composite diffusion tube of a
“design for use in in-pile experiments -with the
deposition in the more usual type of composite
diffusion tube was made.?® Similarities and dif-
ferences were observed; however, with the aid of
this information a useful interpretation of the in-
pile data can be made. In conjunction with this
study, the reactivity of iodine vapor with Dacron
fiber was observed. Deposition on the fiber, which
is used in a fibrous-~filter characterization device
for aerosols, was greater than 90% for elemental
iodine and negligible for the nonelemental species.

Application of the fibrous-filter analyzer, devel-
oped previously for study of filtration processes,”!
as an analytical sampler for particulate material
in moist atmospheres is being evaluated.?? Two
problems are currently under study: (1) the physi-
cal response of the analyzer to an aerosol under
conditions of high humidity and (2) the production
of a radicactive, monodisperse aerosol of known
size with which to calibrate the response of the
analyzer under various combinations of operating
parametets. At low sampling velocities of 3 to
11 fpm, the fibrous-filter analyzer shows promise
as an analytical sampler in a wet atmosphere. The
fiber configuration and filtration processes are
not significantly affected by the moisture., A
satisfactory monodisperse aerosol of known size
has been prepared from a Dow polystyrene latex
solution; however, efforts to tag it radiochemically
have not yet been successful,

tinuing. The technique for the generation and
characterization of the test aerosol has been re-
ported previously, ?*

Results of tests in a dry-air (3% relative
humidity) system indicate that the arc-generated
aerosol consists of {wo particulate size groups,
each of which has different tendencies to pene-
trate a commercial (Flanders 700) high~efficiency
filter medium.”® The less penetrating group is

is trapped at a slightly lower efficiency of >99,9%.
Current using aerosols generated
from UO, clad with either neutron-irradiated stain-
less steel or Zircaloy have produced results similar
to the earlier studies. Similar values were ob-
tained when air velocity ranged from 3.2 to 13 fpm
and when dry helium or argon was substituted for
the air atmosphere.

However, in a recent series of experiments26
in which the relative humidity of the air sweep
ranged from approximately 46 to 100%, the filter
efficiency was noted to drop to as low as 93%.
Fibrous-filter deposition profiles and photomicro-
graphs of an aerosol produced in a 46% relative
humidity experiment indicate that the filtration

iodine are subject to heating by decay of iodine
adsorbed on the charcoal. The heat generated in
pieces of charcoal containing the greatest amount
of adsorbed iodine may raise their temperature to
the ignition point. In order to simulate such an
event, an in-pile experiment that utilizes the f{uel-
melting facility in the Qak Ridge Research Re-
actor has been designed, In this experimeat the
decay of short-lived iodine adsorbed on the char-
coal generates heat. The objective of this ex-
periment is to measure and compare the ignition
temperature of the charcoal with and without fis-
sion product adsorption. A comparison of the cal-
culated decay-heat load on the front surface of the
charcoal in the experimental adsorber with those
of adsorbers at various reactors indicates that
the ignition effects in the reactor adsorbers will
be smaller than those in the experiment.

After the mechanical design and plans for operat-
ing the experiments were shown to be adequate
by tests in a laboratory mockup,?” an initial series
of in-pile experiments was performed.?® In these
experiments the ignition temperature was studied
as a function of both the air flow and the decay-
heat loading., Preliminary results of these studies
indicate that the charcoal ignition temperature is
not greatly affected by the decay heat of adsorbed
fission products,
