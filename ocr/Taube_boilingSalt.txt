Received 10 February 1967

Concepts of fast breeder reactors fueled with fused chlorides of uranium, plutonium, sodium and/or
potassium and cooled directly with boiling coolant are discussed including the SAWA reactor boiling
homogeneously with aluminium chloride as coolant, and the WARS reactor boiling heterogeneously with

metallic mercury as coolant.

Some preliminary calculations for 1000 MWt reactors of both types were performed. The character-
istics considered are: SAWA concept: 6000 litre core, 0.33 MW/, cooled with 1340 kg of AlClg per
second; WARS concept: 10500 litre core, 0.40 MW/1, cooled with 3300 kg of Hg per second.

1. LIQUID FUELS FOR FAST BREEDER
REACTORS

Liquid fuels, irrespective of their chemical
properties, have a number of advantages dis-
cussed earlier [1, 2]. Such fuels can be applied
in thermal reactors as well as in fast breeders.
Molten salt can be considered as one of the more
convenient forms of liquid fuels. Fused salts as
liquid fuel for nuclear reactors were discussed
by Briant and Weinberg [8]. The fluorides were
choosen as being most appropriate. The experi-
mental programme was developed at Oak Ridge
National Laboratory (USA) by Weinberg, Mac-
Pherson and Grimes [4, 5]. A result of these in-
vestigations is the 10 MWt reactor called MSRE.
The fuel in this reactor is a mixture of fluorides
LiF-BeFg-ZrF 4-ThF4-UF4 with melting point of
about 4500C. The construction material is
INOR-8, The MSRE is as yet the only working
reactor fueled with molten salts. Its recent suc-
cessful operation [6] is an encouragement for
this type of reactors.

The application of fused salts in fast breeder
Ieactors promises well. Such a system combines
advantages of fast reactors and of liquid fuels,
but eliminates disadvantages [7]. The properties
of such fuels were discussed by Goodman [8],
Wehmeyer [9] and Bulmer et al. [2]. The in-
Creasing interest in fast breeder reactors [10] is
bound to cause fused salt fuels to receive still
More attention [11-13].

2. COOLING

The cooling system is a decisive element in
reactor design, especially in fast breeders [14].

Two methods of heat removal from a reactor
core containing liquid fuel can be distinguished
in general:

a) External cooling, when the heat is removed
from the fuel circulating outside the core. In
such a case the fuel inventory in the system
1S approximately twice that in the core alone.

b) Internal cooling, when the heat is removed
from the fuel by the coolant circulating
through the core. The fuel inventory is of
course less than in the case of external cool-
ing.

Irrespective of the above mentioned cooling

methods one can additionally distinguish two

other systems:

c) The indirect cooling system, when the coolant
is separated from the fuel by means of mem-
brane.

d) The direct cooling system, when the coolant
is brought into direct contact with the fuel.
Recently the interesting idea of a direct contact
metallic coolant-metallic fuel immiscible sys-
tem was presented by Hammond and Humphreys
[15]. For fused chloride fuel for fast breeders
the concept was discussed by Alexander [11], and
recent remarks were made by Moore and Faw-

cett [16] and Killingback [17].

3. BOILING SALT REACTORS

Fused chloride fuels for fast breeder reac-
tors with direct and indirect cooling systems
110 M. TAUBE et al.

have been the object of investigations in this lab-
oratory since 1960 [18-21]. In this paper the new
concept of boiling salt fast breeder reactors is
presented. Two reactor concepts will be consid-
ered: the SAWA concept [22, 23] and the WARS
concept [24, 25]. In both systems the fuel con-
sists of plutonium trichloride as fissionable ma-
terial, uranium trichloride as fertile material,
and sodium and/or potassium chloride as diluent.
In both types the coolant is boiling, and thus is
partially in the liquid and partially in the vapour
state. The two types differ in the following man-
ner. In the SAWA concept cooling is realised by
direct homogeneous boiling of aluminium chlo-
ride in the core, while in the WARS concept
there is direct heterogeneous boiling of metallic
mercury in the core. So the main specific fea-
ture of both ideas is that the coolant takes the
heat from the core by boiling and transfers it
directly to heat exchanger or turbine. The reac-
tor proposed may be regarded as a pseudo-gas-
cooled type because the gas is evolved in the fuel
phase. It must be noticed that the vapour pres-
sure of the coolants (AlClg and Hgp,et) at 750-
800°C is by about six to seven orders of magni-
tude higher than the vapour pressure of plutoni-
um and uranium chlorides, which assures that
the part of the cooling system which contains
vapour can not reach nuclear criticality.

The specific features of both concepts are

listed in table 1 and shown in fig. 1. For com-

parison some data for the non-boiling fuseq

chloride reactor core calculated by Nelson et 3],

[26] are given.

Besides the data given in table 1 a number of
features may be ascribed to the proposed reac-
tor concepts which one can consider as advan-
tages. These are:

a) simple geometry of the reactor core vessel,
which simplifies also the construction of the
whole system,

b) minimal inventory of fuel in the reactor cycle
due to the use of internal cooling eliminating
fuel flow outside of the core,

c) the irradiated fuel reprocessing system may
be organized "under one roof" with the reac-
tor system,

d) the double breeding cycle 232Th-233U ang
238(-239py seems to be realisable [27],

e) the expected high temperature coefficient of
volumetric expansion leads to an increase in
safety. From preliminary calculations [28] it
follows that the thermal expansion of the fuel -
volume in the WARS concept is an order of
magnitude higher than in the case of non-
boiling salt fuel, and in the SAWA concept it
is several times higher yet than in the WARS.

f) a relatively higher breeding ratio, caused by.
the minimizing of the amount of coolant in the’
core. The mass of the vapour bubbles con-°

state.
Along with the advantages described above, a
number of problems are also introduced which
must be solved in further investigations. These
concern mainly the lack of data about the boiling
mechanism of liquid dissipating heat homogene-
ously and heterogeneously, the mechanism of
initiation, growth, stability and motion of alu-
minium chloride and mercury vapour bubbles in
the liquid salt, the separation of the bubbles
from the salt phase, the neutron transport mech-
anism, criticality, safety-related effects in a
lmicroscopically unstable boiling system, etc.
Also corrosion effects of molten chlorides on
Construction materials and corrosion by fission
Product, and especially by metallic mercury in
the WARS concept, are of great importance. The
danger of leakage of liquid fuel from the rela-

tively high pressure system must be taken into
account. At present all these problems must be
treated as disadvantages of the proposed reactor
concepts.

4, SAFETY CONDITIONS

The safety coefficient of both the SAWA and
WARS concepts is expected to be relatively high.
Safety is primarily related to the thermal expan-
sion coefficient of the fuel., The volumetric
thermal expansion coefficient is 3 X 10-4 oc-1
and the corresponding decrease in reactivity
would be about 1.5% per 10C temperature in-
crease. But beyond this the expansion reactivity
effect is much further increased by void forma-
tion. A prompt increase of temperature due to a
rise of power causes in the SAWA concept an in-

tensification of boiling which leads to anincrease
in the void or vapour volume in the fuel material,
and a decrease of reactivity. To avoid oscillation
of the fuel system due to high instability of the
reactivity, an appropriate geometry for the sys-
tem in the region of the free boiling surface
would be applied [29].

The Doppler effect is expected to be also neg-
ative. Okrent [30] reported that the Doppler ef-
fect is in general negative in the case of large
fast reactors with fuel of intermediate enrich-
ment.
