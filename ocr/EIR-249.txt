A Molten Salt Fast Thermal

Reactor System with no Waste

M. Taube

January 1974
Abstract

A Power system of 1 GW(e) containing a fast breeder reactor
(2GW{t)) with a molten chloride fuel and a thermal burner reac-
tor (~ 0,5 GW(t)) with molten fluoride fuel resulting in a

total breeding system with a doubling time of 30 years 1s des-

cribed.

The fast breeder works on a U-238/Pu-239 cycle, the thermal
burner on Pu-239. The thermal burner 'incinerates' (by neutron
transformation) most of the long lived fission products. Kr-85,
Sr-90, Tc-99, Cs-135 and other. The actinides (Np, Am, Cm)
might be recovered from the molten salt with a high efflciency
and then burnt up in the fast reactor. The entire system pro-
duces no long lived radioactive wastes with the exception of

T and partially Cs-137.

The fast reactor has an inherent stability against power excur-
sions, and loss of coolant accidents because of the two or more
independant cooling circuits and in which the fertile material

(molten uranium chloride) plays the role of coclant.

A very high efficiency aluminium-chloride secondary coolant and
turbine working agent is proposed. Together with a district

heating system practically no thermal pollution occurs,

A very low I-131 and Xe-133 and low Cs=~137 concentration, and
very low CsCl volability in the steady state core due to con-
tinuous gas extraction guarantees the high safety level of this

system.,
I. Why a new reactor system?

 

The present generation of power reactors both thermal and fast
both liquid—cooied (water or sodium) and gas-cooled, use solid
fuel. The single reactor type with positive experience of liquid
fuel is the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (thermal reactor with
molten fluoride and with breeding ratio ~1.05) (Rosenthal, 1972).
Some other molten salt fast reactors have also been discussed

in the literature over several years (Taube, 1961, 1967,

Nelson 1967).

The liquid fuel molten salt reactors have some specific charac-
teristics which make them more attractive for future use, espe-
cially in form of a coupled system of two molten salt power

reactors as 1s proposed here

1) a fast breeder reactor with molten chloride fuel

2) a thermal burner with molten fluoride fuel.

This system appears to have the following special features which
results in a reactor unit much more fitted to the future pattern
of energy production than are the present day solid fuel reac-

tors:
1) high inherent stabllity

?2) much smaller environmental hazard

%) elimination of long lived [ission product wastes and other

radioactive wastes

1) bpetter suited to district heating systems with a rela-

tively high thermal efficiency for electricity generation.
LA

The "fast breeder - thermal burner" system proposed here has

the following specific characteristics

1) 1inherent stability against power excursions which arise
out of the following chain of events: criticality increase~
power excursion > temperature increase » density decrease -
movement of part of the fuel out of the core » very strong

negative influence on the criticality.

2) 1in the fast breeder reactor the loss of coolant is at the
same time the less of blanket which results in a very high
negative coefficient of reactivity in this "Loss of Coolant
Acecident™. The reactor thus shuts down without an engineered

scram.

3) continuous purging of the ligquid fuel Iin the core by means
of a hydrogen/helium stream for extractlon of the vola-
tile fission products especially the most hazardous I-131
and Xe-133% and also I-137, Xe-137, the volatile precursors
of Cs-137 which have a large effect on the environmental

impact in any reactor accident.

4y  continuous reprocessing of liquid fuel with extraction of
the long lived fission products (e.g. Kr-85, Sr-90, Zr-93
Te-99, I-129, Cs-135) and the burning (neutron transfor-

mation) of them in a thermal reactor.

5) continuous reprocessing (with high yield) of the actinides

(Np, Am, Cm) and continuous burning in the fast core.

6) the possibility of having a combined breeding ratio for
both the fast and thermal reactors coupled together,
greater than 1, achieving a doubling time of approx.

30 years.

11)

with the exception of tritium, virtually no nett rejec-
tion of radioactive wastes to the environment, if Cs-137
has been stored practically all the waste 1is transformed

in the form of stable or semi-stable nuclides.

some of the corrosion processes of molybdenum (structural
material) occuring in the core and blanket may be control-

led by the continuous gas purging system.

the high thermal efficiency for electrical energy produc-
tion of the total power system (55 % for only electrical,
or 40 4 for combined electrical and district heating
system) results from the use of a chemically dissociating
medium as secondary coolant and turbine working agent
(AlClB).

the system would seem to be suitable for an underground and

fully automatic power plant of high safety.

this type of reactor gives, as do other molten salt systems,
a complete independance from foreign supplies (no fuel=-
element manufacture, no external reprocessing plant) and

has the ability to 'burn-rocks' - i.e. low grade uranium
"ores" from granites.

The total power system of approx 1 GW(e) contains:

4)

fast breeder reactor with molten plutonium-chlorides fuel
cooled in core by means of fertile material (uranium-238
chloride as fertile and coolant) The thermal power is

approx 2000 MW.

In the coupled fuel cycle the breeder with a breeding
ratio of ~ 1.4 form the basis of the breeding ratio of
the entire system of 1.1 giving a doubling time of approx
30 years. In the fast reactor are also scme of the long

lived fission products being held under the neutron flux.

thermal burner reactor with molten plutonium fluoride

fuel, cooled externally (out of core). The thermal power

is approx 500 MW. In the coupled fuel cycle the burner
(with breeding ratio equal to zero; no fertile material)

is responsible for the burning of the longest lived

fission products coming from both reactors fast and thermal
that 1s from total power of 2500 MW(t).

following circuits

tertiary coolant (e.g. nitrogen dioxide)

hot water for district heating.

multi-stage multicomponent reprocessing system with the

following units.

- reprocessing of the fast core fuel, including prepara-

- reprocessing of the blanket material from the blanket

- preparation of uranium chloride from natural uranium

oxide

- reprocessing of the thermal core fuel
- reprocessing of the irradiated solid or molten long

lived fission products
- reprocessing of the in-core gas purge.

(see Fig. 2)

Since the system contains both breeder and burner reactors and
since a combined breeding ratio greater than 1 1s required the
relationship of the power of the fast breeder and thermal burner

is the highest importance.

The problem of the achievement of the breeding ratio for the
total system can be solved by the following simplified calcula-

tions concerning the ratio between the respective powers.

I1f. The Fast Breeder Reactor

In this study a 2000 MW(t) fast breeder molten chlorides reactor
was used. (Fig. 3% and 4)

The detailed describtion of the reactor type was recently given
(Taube, Ligou, 1973). The most important characteristics are

summarised here: (Table 3 and 4)

1) the liquid fuel contains only plutonium chlorides diluted
by other metal chlorides. The 1n core breeding ratio is
realised by the presence of the uranium-23%8 chloride
(diluted by other metal chlorides) which acts as the coo-
ling agent flowing in the tubes.

2) the fertile material (233 UClB/NaCl) is at the same time

the cooling material and the blanket material.

A very important and desirable feature of this fast reactor can
be seen when tne "maximal design accident'" 1s discussed. This

appears to be the Loss of Cooling Accident (LOCA) (Fig. 5)
The LOCA in fast reactor arises from two events.

1) the increase of criticality due to each coolant (even
helium) being a neutron absorber and the loss of coolant
results in an increace of neutron flux in the core (a
trivial point 1s that in a thermal water cooled reactor

"thne Looss of Coolant" 1s also a "lLoss of Moderator which
reduces the criticality); vhus in a ffast reactor the LOCA

must be accompanied by an enpginecered snut-down device.

2) the radiocactive decay heat of fission products 1s approx
7 % of the normal steady state power level and 1s high
enough to melt the clad and in some cases the fuel in a
few tens of seconds from the LOCA, especially in fast

reactors with a high volumetric specific power.

The "Emergency Core Cooling Systems" are still under critical

review.

Here in this type of fast reactor, both "negative" effects of
LOCA could be virtually eliminated by means of the following

design features (not shut-down devices):

1) the cooling system is coupled with the blanket, that is
the cooling agent plays the role of fertile blanket

material.

2) the cooling system including the blanket region is divided

into two or more fully independant circuits.

3) it is postulated here that a major accldent will cause com-
plete destruction of all but one of these independant cir-

cuit systems and one of the fuel pumps 1is intact.

4} the cooling system sub-divides into several if not all

parts of the cooling region.

During an accident the loss of coolant accident thus brings about
a corresponding loss of blanket in the region affected. The loss
of blanket gives a very strong negative coefficient of reacti-
vity which is clear from Table 4. The roughly estimated value 1is
approw (7 + 1%)/N where N is the number of independant cooling/
planket circuits. In this reactor a failure 1n only one out of
four circuits results in a reactivity decrease of (7 * 1%)/H

which is equivalent to a full scram.
21

Thus the reactor stops without the use of any engineered devices.
It seems that this is the only type of fast reactor with inherent

negative criticality against the Loss of Coolant Accident.

The radiocactive decay heat still has to be removed, if not, the
vessel and cooling tubes may melt down. In this reactor the one
remaining intact cooling circuit is able to remove this heat,

because the molten fuel acts as the internal heat transport me-

dium and assists the heat removal to the one intact system.

IV, The thermal burner reacggg

 

As is shown in chapter VI the most effective neutron transforma-
tion of a large part of the long lived fission products is possib-
le in a thermal neutron flux because the products of cross section
and flux (Oj . Qj) is often larger for thermal neutrons (g, =

thermal) than for fast neutrons (see Fig. 16).

This is one of the reasons for using a thermal burner for the

vransformation.

Some general remarks about the criteria for this thermal burner

are given below:

1) the thermal neutron flux must be as high as possible

but as will be show there is an upper limit. It appears

that a flux of 3 ~ 6 X lOlbn cm_gs_l is most suitable
(e.g. for Teh = 5 parns; o-@ = (5 x 10—2M) X
(6 x 1015) = 2 X 10_83_l which corresponds to an effec-

tive half 1life of 2.25 years).
22

2) the specific volumetric power should not be too high
because the thermal core volume and the neutron balance
has to be kept to a size to accommodate the appropri-
ate amounts of neutron absorbing fission products (e.g.
specific power 1-2 MW/1litre) (for 1 MW/l the core volume
is 500 1, for 2 MW/l the volume 1is ~250 1).

3) the specific power per unit volume must not be toc high
to keep the total power down., The thermal core 1s intended

as a burner only, that is with breeding ratio zero.

4) the core containing only fissionable nuclide, moderator
and appropriate fission products must give the best possible

neutron balance. The following two postulates are added.
5) no fertile material in the core

6) no coolant in the core except for the fuel itself which
is cooled by means of out of core heat exchangers. The
fuel 1s also in liquid form to permit continuous repro-

cessing.

As will be seen from the following discussions the apropriate
specific volume power for this core is choosen to be as high as

possible: 2 MW/1.

(HFIR Reactor in Oak Ridge, USA; 100 MW(t): 100 litre core; 1 MW/1)
CM=-2 Reactor in Mellekes, Soviet Union 50 MW(t); litre; MW/1
both with mean neutron fluxes of 6 x 1015 n cmhgs_l. It must be
stressed that a more conservative figurec of 1 MW/l and flux of

15

3 x 10 n cm—28—1 would also meet the reguirements but of course
with lower effectiveness (higher steady state concentration of
fission products). Fig. 6 and 7 give some detalls concerning the
thermal high flux burner. Some datas concerning the neutron ba-

lance of the thermal burner reactor are given on the Table 5.
23

It is worh mentioning the possibility of a neutron coupled fast/
thermal system which would help to solve the problem should the
thermal burner reactor have too small a k_ due to the large
amounts of neutron absorbing fission products present. In redu-
cing the leakage from the thermal reactor it could be that neu-
tron coupling will improve the entire neutron balance raising the

system breeding ratio over 1.1. (Fig. 8)

V. The in-core continuous gas purging

 

V.a) General remarks

In this reactor an in-core continuous gas purging of the molten
fuel is postulated which significantly improves the safety of this

reactor in an in-core accident.

A mixture of hydrogen-helium gas is continously bubbled through
the liquid fuel in the core. The mean dwell time of the gas-bubb-
les needs to be controlled and the mean transport time of the
molten components to these bubbles must also be controlled (e.g.
if speed-up is desired-intensive mixing, if delay-local addition

of a further gas stream).
The aim of the gas stripping is as follows:

1) to remove the volatile fission products which 1n the case
of an accident control the environmental hazard. (I-131,
Xe-133, Kr-85 and precusors of Cs-137 and at the same
time for the thermal reactor, removal of the I-135, pre-

cursor of Xe-13%5, improves the neutron balance.

2) to contrcl the production of delayed neutrons since most
of the precursors and nuclides of this group are very

volatile, e.g.: Br-I-isotopes.

3) removal of oxygen and sulphur, continously (see Chapter
VIII)

4) in situ control of corrosion problems on structural ma-

terials (see Chapter VIII).

For the sake of a first approximation a gas flux of 30 cm3 per sec.

(normal state) of H2/He is arbitrarily assumed. At 20 bar pressure
30

and with a dwelling time in core of 20 seconds, the gas bubbles

5

will only occupy a fraction of the core equal to 10 ° of its volu-
me and has little influence on the criticality, (but the collap-

sing of bubbles results in a positiv criticality coefficient).

The system proposed for continuous removal of the volatile fission
product from the core itself has a retention time of some hundreds
cf seconds only. Each reprocessing mechanism which operates out

of core is limited by the amount of molten fuel being pumped

from the core to the reprocessing plant. This amount, due to the
high capital cost of the fuel and high operation costs cannot be
greater than that which gives a fuel in-core dwell time of about
one week. Even with a 1 day dwell time, that 1s, 1f a after one
day the fuel goes through the reprocessing plant, no acceptable
solution to the I-131 problem is obtained since the activity of
this nuclide 1s only diminished by one order of magnitude

(see Fig. 9).

Only a direct in-core removal gives the dwell tlime in core as

low as some hindreds of seconds.,

V.b) Delayed neutrons emitters

The principal question arise out of the fact that some of the
short lived iodine and bromine (perhaps also arsenic, tellurium)

1sotopes are the precursors of the delayed neutrons.

As other possible nuclides the following can be considered:

As-85; Kr-92,-93; Rb-92,-93,-94; Sr-97,-98; Te-136,-137; Cs-142,-143,
The removal of these delayed-neutron precursors from the core re-

duces the value of B, which 1is lower for Pu-239 than U-235.

Thus we have a problem of reaching a compromlse between a removal
as rapid as possible of the hazardous 1-131, and as long a dwell
time in the core for the delayed neutron precursors: I1-140, I-139,

I-1%8, I-1%7 and the appropriate bromilne 1sotopes.

The compromise is given by a quasi-steady state regime in the core
in which the amounts of isotopes present are given as an example

in Fig. 10.

In this case the mean dwell time of iodine in the steady state
reactor is about 100 seconds. From the curve in Fig. 9 it can be
seen that the activity of iodine for a 2.5 GW(t) reactor is of
the order of only 10 k curies (for 100 seconds) instead of

~ 100 M curies in the steady state, a decrease of activity of

3

approx. lOLl (or 10° for 1000 second extraction rate).

V. ¢) Gas-extraction and other fission products

The gas-extraction also influence the other volatile nuclides.
From a very rough estimation for these molten salts (with a
small excess of free hydrogen) the following fission products
and thelr associated precursors of iodine and bromine can be

volatile at ~ 1000 °c.

In elementary form: Xe, Kr, Te (?)

In simple volatile hydrides: BrH, IH

In simple volatile chlorides: Sang, SbClB, NbClB, CdClg.
This amount of finally volatile components including I, Br, Xe,
Kr amounts to approximately halfl the total fission products (i.e.
100 micromoles per second). In addition there 1s tue corresponding
amount of tritium (from ternary fission). This amount of all fis-
3/s
or 10 times smaller than the postulated amount of hydrogen flow
at 50 cm3
197%; Beattie, 1973).

sion products corresponds to a gas volume ratio of about 2 cm

/s . For volatile fission products release: see (Farmer,
55

The extraction removes all short lived fission products which are
volatile under these conditions. Thus not only 1is the removal of
the iodine isotopes and the consequent reduction in production

of xenon (e.g. for the atom number: A = 135, 136, 137, 138, 139)
achieved but it slows down the in-core production of Cs-137,
Cs-138, Cs-139 and then also Barium-139 (Fig. 11).

The gas extraction will also cause the vaporization of the higher

components of the liquid fuel: PuCl3 and NaCl.

The fuel consists of:

- 15 mol% PuCl boiling point 2040°K

53
-~ 85 mol% NaCl ; boiling point 1738%K

(see Fig. 1l2).

One can as a first approximation say that it would have to follo-

wing composition in the vapour phase: 5 mol% PuCl, - 95 mol% NaCl.

5

The order of magnitude of vapour for pure components at a tempera-
ture of about 1250 K is

NaCl ~5 x 107° bar; PuCl, ~107" par

For the PuClB-Wa01 system one assumes here a lowering of the

vapour pressure (thermodynamic activity coefficient approx 0.1).

This amount of plutonium is of the order of 10—4 relative to the
amount of plutonium fissioned in the same time (approx lO_u
mol Pu/s). However, it still has to be recovered which makes

the reprocessing unfortunately more complicated.

Last but not least is the in-core gas extraction of two other

VI. The neutron transformation of the fission products

VI. Principle of neutron transformations

Some of long lived radiocactive nuclides are shown in Fig. 13 and
14,

The aim of this part of the paper is firstly to discuss the possi-
pility of the steady state nuclear transformation (steady state
burning) in the thermal neutron region, of the larger part of

the long lived fission products. A first approximation for the
solutions of this problem is given here and a further discussion

initiated.

According to
41

The idea of destroying the beta-active long lived radionuclides

is based on the following:

 

A g~ AE FP = Fission product,
ZFP —— (Z+1) (stable) , primary
tl/2 ~10 years FP = Fisslon product after
irradiation
(n,y) neutron irradiation in high A = Atomic mass

flux reactor = Atomic number

E = Stable nuclide

(A+1) . (A+l)E
FP S (stable)

tl/2 very short (2+1)

 

In Fig. 15 are given the nuclide transformations under a high

fflux discussed here.

This problem of nuclear transformation of fission and non-fissio-
nable actinides, being the irradiation products, has been discussed
for many years. The most recent remarks and calculations con-
cerning this problem made the following claim: "It is not practi-
cal to burn fission product wastes in power reactors because the
neutron fluxes are too low. Developing special burner reactors
wWwith the required (thermal) neutron flux of the order of

1017 n cm—gs_l or burning in the blankets of thermonuclear reac-
tors is beyond the limits of current technology. It seems reaso-
nable to extract tnree actinides (Np, Am, Cm, (M.T.)) for separate
storage or for recycling through the reactors that produce them"
(Claiborne, 1972).
42

Also a controlled thermonuclear reactor CTR was used for calcu-
lation of neutron transformations. In those calculations a neutron
flux of 5 x lOl5n cm“2$_l was used with remark that this flux
level is somewhat higher than that usually associated with CTR
power plants (Wolkenhauer, 1972, 1973). A three year irradiation
was proposed but if would seem that for the most important fission
products the neutron build-up in relation to the radiocactive

decay plays a relatively small role; e.g. for Strontium-90 after

3 years irradiation all neutron reaction products from (n,y) and
(n, 2n) are lower than 10% of those from the radicactive decay
products Sr-90 and for Cs-137 only (n, 2n) products result in

~ 40% of the radiocactive decay products. But (n, 2n) reactions

need a rather hard neutron spectrum (Gore, Leonard, 1973).

VIi. b Cross sections and neutron fluxes for nuclear transformations

 

In this system the following simple evaluations are made

1) the amount of fission pr-ducts coming from both the fast
breeder (2000 MW) and the thermal burner (500 MW)

2) the cores are purged by means oi gas (He + H2 stream) for

ecvacuation of some volatile nuclides (Kr, ¥Xe, Br, I)
%) the fuels and blanket materials are continually reprocessed
4y the irradiated fission products are continuously {(or perio-
dically) separated Tor the sake of eliminating the daughter
stable nuclides (e.g. “r-90 and Zr-91 from the decay and

burning of Sr-90)

5) the amounts C in steady state (ss) burning are calculated

by the obvious relationship for the i-th nuclide.

A more complicated problem is the need for the separation of the
two caesium isotopes Cs-135 for thermal burning and Cs-13%7 for
fast burning or out of core storage. From Fig. 11 it can be seen
that the in-core gas extraction takes out the precursors of
Cs-135, that 1s the long lived volatile I-135 and Xe-135, but the
short lived precursors of Cs-137 remain in the fuel, so the sepa-

ration of these isotopes 1s possible (see Chapter VII),

Among the most dangerous long lived radiocactive wastes are some

of the actinides (see Fig. 13, 14).

The problem of the "destruction" of these nuclides: Np-237,
Pu-238, Am-241, Am-243, Cm-244, Cm-245, is 'simple’. In any high
flux fast or thermal reactor because of the relatively large
cross sections these actinides are burned up, the problem is
only limited by the present state of the reprocessing technology
of irradiated fuel. In the most obvious agueous processes e.g.
the agqueous phase - organic phase extraction, these elements:
Np, Am, Cm being hydrolysed, because of a relatively low concen-
tration, and in the hydrolysed form are not extractable by many
organic extractants. Of course a more refined agqueous process
could give a significant improvement in the recovery of these
actinides making it possible to recycle in the fuel and eventual-

ly to burn-up (Fig. 20 and 21).

In the fused salt fast-thermal system proposed here the recovery
of the actinides seems much easier and simpler due to the fact

that

1) the reprocessing occurs not in an aqueous but in a molten
salt medium; the hydrolysis of the low concentration

actinides is not possible; the recovery 1s very high.

2) the continuous remotely operated extraction processes and
preparation of the liquid fuel, and the absence of fuel
elements etc, make this recycling of the actinides (very
hazardous alpha and partly neutron emitters) possible

and desirable.

The high grade recovery of the actinides postulated here gives
the steady state results for the fast reactor shown in Fig. 20
and 21. The reason for burning in the fast and not in the ther-
mal reactor is based on the fact that the relation ég/dzh is

greater in the fast reactor than in the thermal.

It must be remembered that the relatively high neutron flux
results not only in the irradiation of the non desirable radio-
active nueclides but also the stable fission products, not to
mention the stable components of the fuel and the structural
material. A very short review of these partial processes 1s

given here

The effective burning of the most important long lived nuclides
needs a rather complicated reprocessing plant with high tempera-
ture pyrochemical separation methods, both in gaseocus and liquid
salt or/and metallic phases. In some cases alsoc a retention volume

is necessary (for spontaneus decay of short-lived nuclides).

This reprocessing philosophy arises from the following assumptions:
The caesium nuclides are very hazardous but there are at least
two isotopes Cs-135 (t 1/2 = 2 x 106a) and Cs-137 (t 1/2 = %0 a).
The first one has a reasonable cross section from the point of
view of neutron transformation (Gth £ 8 barn), the seco?d a very
small cross section in both fast and thermal reactors ¢ = 100 mb
or less, Gth = 110 mb). The separation of two flows e.g. Cs-135
for thermal burning and Cs-137 for quasi burning (rather self-

decaying) could help solve this problem.

In this system the continuous in core gas purgling system is expec-
ted to extract some of the volatile fission products especilally
those with. longer half 1life period. In the case of caeslium the

separation of both isotopes is possible due to the different time

—_—

The extractable volatile and relatively long lived nuclides in
short time gas purging are underlined. The Cs-135 could be

extracted in the form of the precursors. Cs-137 is retained in
the fuel and must be separated by more conventional (but not so

simple) methods.
58

Another similar problem arises in the case of zirconium isotopes
(see Fig. 18/IV) and iodine (Fig. 18/II). Part of the zirconium
could be used as a diluent of the homogenous fuel for the thermal
core (e.g. 20 mol% ZPFM + 80 mol% FeF2) part as component of the
molten fuel for the fast core (?) and part in metallic form as
structural (but radioactive) material when in the final period of
fast reactor development when the Zr-93% will be reduced to less

than 1 mass % of the total zirconium

Some further similar questions will have to be discussed, in some
a separation of isotopes 1s possible by means of rapid in core
gas extraction or slow ocut of core (liquid phase) separation

process.

A preliminary draft of the possible reprocessing scheme is given

in Flg. 23.

VIII. Molybdenum and corrosion processes

 

Tne corrosion processes in this type of reactor are of crucial
importance. In the cores of these reactors are approx 950 kg

molybdenum or approx 10'000 mol.

We postulate here, arbitrarily, a relatively high corrosion rate
egquivalent to a full or 100% corrosion of the complete amount

of molybdenum 1in approx 10 years. This means a corrosion rate of:

10'000 mol molybdenum 5

Thus 30 micromoles molybdenum per second (or approx 3 mg Mo/s).
In addition to this we have molybdenum as fission product. In
the 2000 MW(t) fast reactor the amount of fissioned plutonium

equals:

2000 MW(t) x 1 day x (1.06 g Pu/MWd(t)) % 2150 g Pu/day

or: 25 mg Pu/s: that is; 100 y mol Pu/s.

The production side of fission products equals 200 u mol/s.
Molybdenum i1s present at about 18 mol% of fission products which
means a 36 u mol/s, or almost half the amount of corroding ma-
terial. From both sources, corrosion and fissioning the amount
of molybdenum 1s about 50 u mol/s. The corrosion processes can

go in three directions

1) Chloride reaction Mo + 2 Cl + Me+ +~ MoCl. + Me
met 2 met

2) Oxygen reaction Momet + 02 -> IVIoO2

3) Tellurium reaction IVIomet + Te2 - MoTe2

These and eventually other molybdenum corrosion processes are
potentially dangerous and should when possible be prevented in
tne core itself. This possibility exists due to the reaction

with the gaseous hydrogen (see also Chapter IV).

1) MOCl2 + H2 - Momet + 2HC1
2) M002 + H2 > Momet + 2H20
3 ) MoTe2 + 2H2 > Momet + 2TeH2 > Te2 + 2H2

In the extreme case the molar amount of hydrogen is twice as big

as that of molybdenum giving 120 u mol H2/s.

Under normal conditions (1 bar, 0°C) this amount of hydrogen 1is

acceptable:

For further calculations we arbitrarily assume ten times more,

approx 30 cm Hg/s. (see also Chapter V)

Here is a major question concerning the reaction of metallic
molybdenum with hydrogen. From about 100 elements there are only

twelve elements which form no chemical binding with hydrogen.

du d5 d6 dT d8
5d - Electrons Mn Fe Co
g - Electrons Mo Tc Ru Rh
5d - Electrons W Re Os Ir Pt

Thus molybdenum fulfills the minimum requirements: it has no
reaction with hydrogen. Also manganese-cobalt alloys are suitable

for this reactor (chromium and nickel not!).

In addition the solubility of hydrogen in molybdenum is relatively
small., The dependence of the solubility of H2 in Mo-metal on tem-
perature and pressure is known since molybdenum is a possible
constructional material for contalning plasma (hydrogen) in fusion
reactors. Also the diffusion of hydrogen through metallic molyb-

denum is relatively very small (see Fig. 26).

The diffusion rate of hydrogen from the melted fuel to coolant

and blanket (here also UCl_, - NaCl) needs to be discussed.

5

One can assume, however, that also this melt with hydrogen

is saturated so that the porosity of the wall (molybdenum) will
play a minor role. The most important: the variation in mechani-
cal properties of the molybdenum caused by the dissolved hydro-

gen.

The problem of the corrosion of molybdenum in chlorine containing
media 1s particularly complicated by the numerous moclybdenum

chlorides: MoClg, MoClB, MoClu, MoClS.

Also the oxygen chlorine systems for molybdenum and some selec-

ted fuel components including hydrogen are rather complex
(Fig. 24).

In the region of the external heat exchanger the main corrosion
process results from the action of gaseous aluminium chloride

(the secondary working agent)

AlCl3 + % Mo - % M0012X + AlCl( )
(g) (&) &

This reaction has been discussed in earlier publications (Blander
1957) but unfortunately not all the thermodynamic data 1s known.
The stability of the molybdenum chlorines is of course strongly
influenced by the concentration of free chlorine and also by

the temperature.

A more detailed calculation of metallic molybdenum corrosion in
the aluminium trichloride is needed. These calculations are

very sensitive to the vapour pressure of chlorides. More detailed
calculations of the corrosion in this system have been given

earlier (Taube, Schumacher 1969).

IX. Molybdenum and iron irradiated in a fast high flux reactor
IX a) Nuclear effects

The high neutron flux irradiation causes physical and chemical

changes in structural materials.

Molybdenum 1s a mixture of stable isotopes (Fig. 27). The most
important by-product of neutron irradiation is the Tc-99 beta-
emitter with t 1/2 2 2.1 x lO5 year and which belongs to the

chain (stable nuclides underlined)

IX b) Radiolysis of molten chlorides in very high flux of fast

neutron

The high flux of neutrons and especially of the fission fragments
results in a high damage in the fuel material and cladding. In
the type of reactor under discussion this problem seems to be

much easiler to solve because

1) the molten chlorides are fluids with structure that is
with a very low activation energy for recombination of
the radiolysis product and therefore with a very high

recombination velocity.

2) 1in core there are no structural materials (tube, clailding

ete,)
70

¥X. Aluminium trichloride as a secondary coolant and working agen®

 

In this consideration for the power production a non conventional
gas-turbine cycle is postulated: we have chosen aluminium tri-

chloride, AlClB.

Tt is now clear that this chosen secondary coolant-working fluic
substance has specific additional properties, which make 1t
particularly intersting in the present application. The reason
is the following: it is well known that real progress in im-
provement of the thermal efficiency of turbines is limited by

two parameters:

1) for steam turbines, corrosion effects with non austenic
steel above 580°C on the one hand, and on the other hand
the dramatic increase of costs when an austenic steel 1s

used.

2) for gas turbines (e.g. helium), the operation of the gas-
compressor consumes more tnan half of the energy produced
by the power turbines. A number of methods are available
for overcoming these limitations, one of these proceeds
as follows: the working agent in the turbine, when the
temperature decreases undergoes a chemical reaction which
decreases the volume. This result is most convenilently
obtained when the working substarnce polymerises at the
lower temperature. Of course, this polymersiation must
be completely reversible, that is to say that, at the
nigher temperature, the depolymerisation process is
effectively complete. One of the most promising working

agent is aluminium trichloride, which, at the lower
71

temperature dimerises by the following mechanism:

(2 A1C1.) 885 (A1.c1.)888 (A1.C1. )tia-
—_— =~ 2 T = 27067 .
mononer dlimer dimer

higher temp. lower temp. lower temp.

When the temperature increases a monomerisation process takes
place. Already in 1959 Blander and co-workers discussed the prob-
lem of AlCl3 as working agent. They wrote: "A number of typical

application (including a gas turbine cycle employing AlCl3 as the
working fluid and a bilnary vapour cycle employing water vapour
for the lower temperature: M.T.) have been considered but in none
of these has the aluminium chloride shown outstanding advantages
over more conventional media. However, it is believed that for
some specilal applications it may well prove to have outstanding
advantages, where the characteristics of the other system com-
ponents are such as to make 1t possible to exploit to the fullest

-
the unique characteristics of aluminium chloride" (Blander, 1959).

Much more optimistic conclusions could be seen in the papers of
Krasin and Nesterenko (1972). These authors maintain that the
overall thermal efficiency of a dual cycle with aluminium chlo-
ride as working fluid in the high temperature cycle and N02 in
the low temperature cycle promises to increase up to 60% for

800 °c and 90 ata (see also: Krasin, 1971).

But with aluminium chloride and with nitrogen dioxide the chemi-
cal industry has considerable experience, including experience
with corrosion problems, in the high-temperature region. Unfor-
tunately there seems to be a lack of data concerning the erosion
and corrosion behaviour of these substances in turbines and on

their behaviour under neutron irradiation in reactor conditions.
72

Aluminium chloride as a working fluid in a condensation turbine

has the following advantages:

1)

2)

3)

the efficiency of the power generation is about 30-50%
higher than for the "classical" working fluids; helium
or steam. The quantity of fuel used 1is correspondingly
smaller. For a country in which the sources of uranium an

and plutonium are limited this advantage may be decisive.

the waste heat 1s smaller an the temperature of the hea-
ting water is lower. In a country in which the only sources
of cooling water are the rivers, such an advantage is of

importance.

the size of the turbine 1s approximately 5 times smaller
than for a steam turbine of the same power. For a direct
cycle (when the reactor coolant agent is the working fluid
in the turbine) when the circult is radioactive theysmall

size of turbine 1s an important factor.

all these properties of an aluminium chloride circuit have
a significant influence 1in reducing the capital cost of

a power station.

Let us repeat the advantageous properties: decreased fuel con-

sumption, reduction of waste heat, decrease of turbine size. All

these trends promise to give a significant reduction in power

generating costs.

The crucial problem of possible corrosion processes caused by

may be controlled by the small addition of hydrogen.
