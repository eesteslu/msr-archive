TERMINATION REPORT FOR CONSTRUCTION OF THE ART FACILITY
W. F. Ferguson, F. R. McQuilkin, G. C. Robinson, and R. D. Stulting

1. GENERAL
The ART facility, ORNL Building 7503, is a

modification of the facility used for the Aircraft
Reactor Experiment (ARE). Its purpose was to
house all equipment and appurtenances required
to install and operate a 60-megawatt reflector-
moderated circulating-fuel reactor whose basic
design is suitable for aircraft use. The facility
is located in Okra Valley approximately 0.75
mile southeast of the center of the present ORNL
area. Further information concerning the facility
and facility site can be found elsewhere. !

The program for design and construction of the
ART facility was subdivided into six packages,
Package |, consisting of additions to Building
7503, construction of the reactor cell, and in-
stallation of the required building services, was
designed by the K-25 Plant Engineering Division
and constructed by V., L. Nicholson Company,
Package A, consisting of installation of auxiliary
service pipe lines for nitrogen, air, cooling water,
helium, lubricating oil, and hydravlic oil, was
designed by the ORNL Engineering and Mechanical
Division and constructed by V. L. Nicholson
Company. Package Il, consisting of furnishing
and erecting a prefabricated steel building, in-
stallation of diesel generators and appurtenances,
installation of electrical motor control centers, and
installation of the electrical system and air
conditioning equipment for the spectrometer room,
was designed by the ORNL Engineering and
Mechanical Divisionand constructed by Rentenbach
Engineering Company. Package IlIA, consisting
of installation of dry air system, installation of
lube oil fill and waste system, installation of
NaK motor controllers and resistors, installation
of louver hydraulic system, and installation of a
prefabricated steel building, was designed by the
ORNL Engineering and Mechanical Division and
constructed by Rentenbach Engineering Company.
Package Ill, consisting of all work outside the
reactor cell required to complete the facility, was
being designed by the ORNL Engineering and
Mechanical Division and was to be installed by
ORNL craft personnel. Package |V, which in-
cluded all work inside the reactor cell, was being

Summary Report, ORNL-1835 (Jan. 19, 1955) (classified).

  

designed by the Aircraft Reactor Engineering
Division (ARED). It was planned to have this
package installed by ORNL forces also.

Authorization of expenditures for the capital
portion of the facility installation program was
obtained through Budget Directive CL-169 dated
March 10, 1955, and Modifications 1, 2, 3, and 4
thereto dated September 7, 1955, October 21, 1955,
March 30, 1956, and December 26, 1956, re-
spectively, The basic directive (CL-169) author-
ized capital expenditures of $1,500,000 and con-
struction activity expenditures of $270,113. The
authorized construction activity expenditures
level was increased to $275,000 by Modification
No. 3. Meodification No. 4 established an author-
ized expenditure level as follows:

Activity $ 274,326

Capital 1,200,000
Tables A-1 and A-2, which are appended, show the
status of expenditures as of September 1957 as
auvthorized by Directive CL-169. Another modifi-
cation to Directive CL-169 had been requested,
which would have extended the completion date for
capital work from June 30, 1957, to June 30, 1958.
Lump-sum contract work at the facility was
performed under Atomic Energy Commission Con-
tracts AT-(40-1)-1952 and AT-(40-1)-1954, The
Y. L. Nicholson Company was prime contractor
under Contract AT-(40-1)-1952. The contract
consisted of all work specified by the Package |
and Package A drawings and specifications.
Contract AT-(40-1)-1954 included all work speci-
fied by the Package !l and Package I{IA drawings
and specifications. Rentenbach Engineering
Company was prime contractor for this contract,
Pertinent information pertaining to the afore-
mentioned contracts can be found in the Appendix,
Table A-3. A breakdown of contract cost and a
list of unit prices estimated from contract cost
can be found in Tables A-6, A-7, and A.8.
Approximately $82,000 worth of material was
procured for Package Ill and IV work. It was
planned to start installation of Package Il
items during the latter part of calendar year 1958,
Schedules (Table B-1), budget (Table A-4), man-
power estimates (Table B-2), and other infor-
mation pertaining to installation of Packages IlI

 
 

 

and |V are appended. Table A-5 shows our
present evaluation of the adequacy of the budget
figures which appear in the Appendix. Plans to
complete the facility were canceled during
September 1957. After cancellation, operational
costs were incurred only in connection with placing
the building in standby condition and canceling
outstanding facility purchase orders. No capital
expenses were incurred after July 1, 1957. Total
capital expenditures for fiscal years 1955, 1956,
and 1957 were $21,494, $760,051, and $342,108,
respectively, Total operational expenditures for
fiscal years 1956, 1957, and 1958 were approxi-
mately $438,000, $482,000, ond  $123,000, re-

2. BUILDING

Existing Building
The ART facility, Building 7503, is a modifi-

cation of a facility which was used for the Air-
craft Reactor Experiment (ARE). The ARE
facility consisted of a building 106 ft 6 in, by
82 ft 9 in. which is located at a site 0.75 mile
southeast of the center of the present ORNL
area and about 0,24 mile northeast of the homo-
geneous  reactor (HRT) facility.
Further information concerning the facility site
can be found elsewhere,?

The ARE building and auxiliary services were
designed by the Austin Company, Engineers and
Builders, of Cleveland, Ohio. A list of pertinent
drawings and specifications concerning the ARE
facility design can be found in the Appendix
(Table C-1).

experiment

Additions
Building and Grounds Extension. - Roads,
security fences, and grounds were altered to
accommodate the ART facility in accordance

with Package | design drawings. This design was
furnished by the K-25 Plant Engineering Division.
Drawings pertinent to these alterations can be
found listed in the Package | drawing tabulation
(Table C-2).

An extension of 52 ft was added to the south
end of the existing ARE building. At floor
elevation (852 ft) this extension included an
enlargement of the locker room facility, an office
20 ft 6 in, by 17 ft 6 in. for the Health Physics
Division, an office 20 ft 6 in. by 20 ft 6 in. for
crafts foremen, approximately 485 sq ft of shop
space, and space for the reactor pressure vessel
and water vessel. This extension also included:
at elevation 840 ft a room for the Solid State
Division, a laboratory for the Chemical Technology
Division, a conference room, and a spectrometer
equipment room for the Applied Nuclear Physics
Division; at elevation 831 ft a control tunne!l for
routing facilities into the cell; at elevation 835 ft
5 in. a facility for the main air duct; at elevation
820 ft a radiator pit for housing NaK dump tanks
and purification equipment; at elevation 832 ft
a spectrometer tunnel where the cell spectrometer
tubes terminate; and at elevation 828 ft 7 in. a

room for housing the special heat dump equipment.

In addition to the building extension, the
structural steel of the crane bay in the existing
building was modified to withstand the reactor
weight., The existing 10-ton crane was modified
to a 6%-ton crane plus a monorail with a 3-ton
electrical hoist. An additional 30-ton crane was
added in order to install the reactor.

Pertinent drawings and specifications con-
cerning the additions to the 7503 building are
tabulated in the list of Package | drawings and
specifications which is in the Appendix (Table
C-2).

Cell. ~ The cell is located in the south portion
of the crane bay, immediately adjacent to the
penthouse and special equipment room. It was
intended to house the ART reactor, the fuel fill
and drain tank, the fuel recovery tank, and other
associated equipment. It would therefore have
served as the final barrier and containment in the
event of reactor or component failure.

Basic criteria for the cell are found in Design
Memos 3-B-1 through 3-B-6.

Design criteria for the cell are found in Con-
struction Design Memo 7503-5 and in Package |
drawings and specifications. Detail design and
stress analysis were done by the Chicago Bridge &
Iron Company, subcontractor for the cell under
the Package | contract,.

Construction as described by Chicago Bridge &
lron Company’s drawings was essentially com-
pleted. The water tank and pressure vessel heads
have been removed and are stored across the road
from Building 7503 in order to permit unimpeded
access tothe cell during installation of cell equip-
ment.

Tests performed on the cell were as follows:

1. Following stress relief of the pressure
vessel, a hydrostatic test at 315 psia was per-
formed on the pressure vessel. Leaks were
discovered on the junction panel nozzles, All
eight junction panel sleeves were removed, and
modified two-piece sleeves were welded into the
pressure vessel, In order to obtain a better bond
between the junction panel sleeves and the 4-in.
plate of the vessel, a weld detail similar to a
slip joint flange pipe weld was used,

2. A Freon air test at 15 psig with a General
Electric halide leak detector was then performed
on the pressure vessel, No leaks were observed.

3. A hydrostatic test at 315 psia was performed
on the pressure vessel. No leaks were observed.

 
4, The water was then removed from the pressure
vessel to the water tank. Leaks found in the
water tank were repaired.

5. The testing of the water tank described in
(4) also served to provide a buoyant load on the
pressure vessel, thus stressing the pressure
vessel support skirt,

6. A vacuum leak test was then performed on
the pressure vessel. Eight days were required to
pump down to approximately 10 microns. A leak
on a temporary plug caused considerable trouble
in pumping down. A pressure rise test was per-
formed for 32 hours with no pressure change
observed.
and coolant sleeves, and main plate seams in

Temporary connections, junction panel

order were probed several times; no leaks were
observed on a Consolidated Engineering Corp.
leak detector. An over-all leak rate was then
determined by utilizing the water tank as a hood
for containing helium and comparing the over-all
leakage with a standard leak (14,7 micron cubic
feet per hour) on the Consolidated Engineering
leak detector. Backgrounds before the test run
and after pumping down the signal from the
standard leak were the same. The signal from
the standard leak (corresponding to 14,7 micron
cubic feet per hour) peaked at 5,8 on the ‘‘ten’’
scale with 100-second response. Background was

0.2 to 0.3 on the *‘one’’ scale. Therefore it was

felt that a leak of the order of 5 micron cubic

feet per hour should have been detected with ease.

The maximum acceptable leakage rate permitted

by the Package | specifications was 32 micron

cubic feet per hour,

The only modifications which were anticipated
for the cell are as follows:

1. attachment of an aluminum conical vessel to
the pressure vessel head to facilitate shielding
studies,

2. minor modifications to the pressure vessel
floor structure to permit better access to the
fuel fill and drain tank,

3. possible replacement of the cell crane with a
higher capacity unit and provision for remote
control,

4, possible replacement of the dump tank support
mechanism,

Final attachment of the water tank and pressure
vessel heads was planned to be done in a fashion
similar to Chicago Bridge & Iron Company’s
procedures. Clips, wedges, platform brackets, and
fittings were loaned to ORNL in order to expedite
the welding of the final girth seam.

After attachment of the NaK piping anchor cones
and junction panels it was planned to perform a
vacuum leak test of all untested welds in order
to ensure the required integrity for the cell and
the containment piping with a maximum leak rate
of 0.002 cc per second. A helium *'sniffer’’ test,
as well as a possible pressure test, of the final
pressure vessel girth seam and the manhole
closure weld was also planned. Six of the eight
junction panels were being designed by the
Instrumentation and Controls Division as nitrogen-
buffered pressure vessels for the passage of
leads for instrumentation and electrical power,
The pressure vessels were to be welded to the
junction panel flanges. Buffering of these vessels
was required since the hermetic seals in the
vessel end plates could not meet the required
leakage rates. The remaining two junction panels
were being designed by the ARED Design Depart-
ment for the passage of tubing and pipe. These
panels were to consist of heavy plates welded
to the pressure vessel junction panel flanges, to
which the pipes and tubes which pierce it were
to be welded.

Expansion joints, which were being procured
by ARED, were to be welded between the junction
panel| pressure vessel and water tank sleeves in
order to exclude water. A soap air test at 15 psig
was planned for these welds,

Blower House. — The blower house is a con-
crete block structure, 44 x 36 ft, which is located
on the west side of the crane bay adjacent to the
southwest corner of the main building, It was
intended to serve the following functions:

1. housing of the four main process air blowers
and motors, the two main annulus blowers
and motors, and the instrument and control
tunnel exhaust blower and motor,

2. intake air plenum for the above blowers,

3. filtering of intake air by passage of the air
through fine-mesh screen located in the blower
house walls,

4. principal access to the radiator pit,

The blower house principal floor level, at ele-
vation 838 ft, was recessed below the outside
ground elevation to provide adequate space for
the main process air blowers. Solid concrete
block wing walls were extended out from the
north and south blower house walls to serve as
radiation shields. It was also planned to stack
pit plugs around the blower house adjacent to the
wing walls in order to complete the necessary
radiation shielding,

3. UTILITIES
Electrical

The electrical service to Building 7503 consists
of a single 13,800-volt 3-phase line which origi-
nates at the ORNL substation and also feeds
the 7500 area and the Tower Shielding area.
7503 Facility Drawing D-AF-110 shows the single-
line diagram of the system. Construction design
memos specifying detail design criteria and detail
design drawings are listed in the Appendix
(Table E-1).

The existing building auxiliary service consists
of a 750-kva 13,800/480-volt outdoor transformer
bank feeding two distribution panels which were
provided for the ARE. The single-line diagram
D-AF-110 and Construction Design Memo 7503-35
indicate the addition of a transformer secondary
breaker and rearrangement of the distribution panel
feeds in order to provide for a process main blower
load. No detail design has been prepared for this
arrangement.

The distribution panels supply the building
lighting, 110-volt convenience receptacles, 440-volt
power receptacles, air conditioning units, 10-
and 30-ton cranes, exhaust and vent fans, unit

20

heaters, sump pump, space coolers, and roll-up
door. The single-line diagram for the distribution
panels is shown on 7503 Facility Drawing
D-AF-119. The detail construction drawings are
tabulated in the Appendix and were prepared by
the Austin Company for the origindl construction;
by the ORNL Engineering and Mechanical Division
for revisions for the ARE; by the K-25 Engineering
Division for alterations and additions to Building
7503, Package |; and by the ORNL Engineering
ond  Mechanical Division for additions to
Building 7503, Package il. The 7503 Facility
Drawings D-AF-117 through D-AF-125, D-AF-127,
and D-AF-129 are as-built details, representing a
consolidation of all construction drawings and
dismantling operations.

The lighting for areas except the service area
and adjacent offices, the southwest basement
entrance, and portions of the crane bay is arranged
for manual throwover to a 100-kva transformer fed
from the diesel generator power as described in
Section 4.

Criteria for additions to the lighting system
consist of main control room, auxiliary control
room, and information room lighting as described in
Construction Design Memo 7503-43, and provisions
for automatic throwover for control rooms and
other emergency operation areas.

Alterations and dismantling operations were
performed by the Package | and Package Il
contractors. Design of additions and rear-
rangements for the main blower feed were scheduled
for completion by January 1, 1958, Construction
was scheduled for completion by March 1, 1958.

Water

Water is supplied to Okra Valley and subsequently
to Building 7503 from the ORNL potable water
system. Original design of the supply header was
made by the Austin Company. (See Appendix for
drawings.) Modifications have recently been made
to the Austin Company design by tying the
Building 7503 é-in. supply header to the 10-in.
process line and bypassing the 750-gal storage
tank, which is situated atop the ridge separating
Bethel and Okra Valleys, thereby tying the 10-in.
process line directly to the 12-in. line which
connects to the south tank farm. These changes
are estimated by the ORNL Engineering and
Mechanical Division to improve water supply to
both Buildings 7500 and 7503 and to result in a
maximum capacity of 650 gpm with 1.9 ft of residual

 
head at the .top of the process water tank at
Building 7503.

Distribution of potable water within the building
was originally designed by the Austin Company
and installed in the original construction of
Building 7503, then known as Test Facilities
Building No. 22, Subsequent modifications to this
system were designed by the K-25 Plant Engi-
neering Division and the ORNL Engineering and
Mechanical Division and installed in Package |
and Il construction. Drawings of these modifications
are tabulated in the Appendix.

Included in the uses of the potable water system
which has been constructed are the following:
(1) men’s locker room, (2) women’s rest room,
(3) water coolers, (4) fire hydrants, (5) service
taps, (6) space coolers for penthouse, (7) 7503 cell
water tank supply, (8) adsorber, (9) air compressors,
(10) hot water system, and (11) cooling water for
air conditioners. As may be noted from the
foregoing listing, some of the uses tied to the
potable water system are not sanitary but process
functions. Only those process uses which required
a boost in the normally available water pressure
or are a part of the cell containment system have
been tied to the process water system. Flow
Diagram D-2-02-054-1466 by the ARED Design
Department delineates the various usages intended
for the sanitary and process water systems and
shows the separation of the systems. The process
water system will be discussed in detail in a
following section,

No additional services were anticipated for the
sanitary water system. Construction of this system
is complete except for the addition of a flow
measuring station in the vent house for the supply
to the charcoal adsorber pit.

Steam

Saturated steam at 250 psig is supplied from the
ORNL Steam Plant to Building 7503 through a
6-in. header which also serves Building 7500.
A steam reducing station drops the pressure to
50 psig prior to entry into Building 7503. This
header was originally designed and constructed by
the ORNL Engineering and Mechanical Division.
The loop over the building entrance road which
was in this header was subsequently removed in
accordance with K-25 Plant Engineering design in
Package | construction in order to provide un-
impeded access to the building.

The distribution system within the building was
originally designed by the Austin Company and

constructed by the V. L. Nicholson Company as
Test Facilities Building No. 22. In accordance
with this design, steam at 50 psig is used for
heating potable water., Steam reduced to 15 psig
is used for building heating through the use of
unit heaters, finned pipe, and air conditioning
steam coils.

The building 15-psi system was expanded to
serve other heating units in Package | construction
in accordance with design by the K-25 Plant
Engineering Division and the ORNL Engineering
and Mechanical Division and in Package !l
construction in acg¢ordance with design by the
ORNL Engineering and Mechanical Division.

No further permanent additions or alterations
to the steam system were anticipated except for
(1) possible modifications resulting from a possible
redesign of the air conditioning system for the
main control room and instrument shop, (2) possible
modifications to the piping for the office area air
conditioners to remove interferences with auxiliary
control room trays, and (3) replacement of a
defective steam coil in the basement heating
unit.

The unit heaters from the health physics and the
craft foreman’s and field engineers' offices will
be temporarily used in the diesel generator house
for winter protection of the diesel generators.

4. PROCESS AUXILIARIES
Electrical

Two independent electrical systems, fed from
separate sources, were provided to satisfy
electrical reliability requirements for feeds to the
process auxiliary equipment. The existing 13,800-
volt 3-phase line originating at the ORNL sub-
station provided one power source, and diesel
generator units installed locally provided the
second power source. 7503 Facility Drawing
D-AF-110 shows the single-line diagram of the
systems. Construction design memos specifying
design criteria and detail design drawings are
listed in the Appendix (Table E-1).

The added generating and substation equipment
was located adjacent to the west side of the
building in order to minimize the length of load
cables and reduce interferences in the basement
area.

The additions to the original 13,800-volt system
consist of an overhead line extension to a 1500-kva

21

 

 
13,800/480-volt 3-phase oil-type transformer, and
an underground cable connection to a switchgear
unit.

The design requirement for the power system
feeding from the ORNL substation was established
as 1200 kva. All equipment was designed on this
basis except for the 1500-kva transformer obtained
from K-25 surplus. A lightning flashover was
experienced on the transformer primary leads
above the oil level on July 17, 1957. The leads
were taped and the equipment was re-energized;
however, installation of additional primary lead
supports and station-type lightning arresters was
planned to increase the expected reliability of the
equipment.

The diesel power system consists of five 300-kw
0.8-pf 480-volt 3-phase diesel-driven generator
units connected to a switchgear unit and arranged
for parallel operation. Four diesel generator units
and the associated controls were specified on
ORNL Requisition D-15936 and were procured
from the Buda Division, Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co.,
on Purchase Order W8X-18089. One unit was
transferred from Y-12 surplus; it was specified on
Equipment Specification ES1-574526 and procured
from Caterpillar Tractor Company on Purchase
Order W35Y-31315. The diesel generator units
were installed in Package Il. Caterpillar Tractor
Company supplied an oversize generator rated
1000 kw, 0.8 pf, in order to meet equipment specifi-
cation requirements for starting with a large
inductive load.  Additional information on the
diesel generators and auxiliaries for both types of
units is tabulated on bid proposal data sheets.

Auxiliary equipment consists of a 5000-gal fuel-
oil storage tank, a fuel transfer pump and 100-gal
day tank for each wunit, a 32-volt battery and
charger for starting each Buda unit, and an air
compressor and receiver for starting the Caterpillar
unit.

Diesel starting control is provided at the units.
All other control is located on the five control
panels located in the switch house. Equipment
on each panel consists of generator and exciter
metering, voltage regulator, exciter field rheostat,
governor switch and indicating lights, synchronizing
switch, engine shutdown device, and annunciator
alarm device.  Synchronizing is accomplished
manually by use of a synchroscope, indicating
lights, and metering located on a swinging panel,
or automatically by synchronizing relay (GE
Type GES) and automatic synchronizing selector
switch,

22

The switchgear unit that is supplied from the
13,800-volt line consists of a 1600-ompere
transformer breaker, a 1500-ampere bus, two
1600-ampere main blower breakers, a current-
limiting reactor to limit fault currents to 25,000
amperes, and other load breakers as shown on
Facility Drawing D-AF-110. The switchgear
unit that is supplied from the diesel-driven
generator units consists of five generator load
breakers and other load breakers as shown on
D-AF-110. Switchgear units were installed in
Package I, The loads were arranged on the power
systems in such a way that each system would
supply the process auxiliary equipment required
for shutdown in the event the other power system
failed. Interconnections between the systems
were held to a minimum, and all precautions
were taken to eliminate any possibility of one
faulted system affecting the other system.
Construction Design Memo 7503-35 outlines
changes to the electrical equipment feeding the
fuel dump tank NaK system in order to provide for
a fast throwover of the power system and changes
to the interlocking scheme for the diesel main
blower breakers. These changes have not been
made in the equipment.

Each switchgear unit supplies a control center
consisting of removable units located in the
switch house. The control centers which were
installed in Package |l were to provide power to
the smaller process auxiliary loads. The equipment
as shown on the single-line diagram, Facility
Drawing D-AF-110, includes minor changes to
existing equipment. The electric heater distri-
bution centers, induction regulators, and Power-
stats are fed from these control centers. ORNL
Drawings D-26430 and D-26431 show the single-
line diagram of the heater circuits. All equipment
except heaters, heater leads, and control circuits
was installed in Package |lIIA. Heater information

is tabulated in ORNL Drawing B-26432.

Process auxiliary equipment presently connected
to switchgear and control centers consists of
main blowers, main annulus blowers, process
water booster pumps, control tunnel blower, and
diesel auxiliary equipment. A 100-kva 480/120-
208-volt lighting transformer is supplied from the
diesel power system and connects to manual
transfer switches to provide lighting during a
fauvlt of any equipment serving the normal lighting
panels. Power conduit is provided for equipment
to be located in the special equipment room,

 

 
penthouse area, and compressor house. Wound-
rotor-motor resistors and controller units for the
main and auxiliary NaK pumps are installed in the
compressor house. Cable trays for instrument and
control service are installed in the control tunnel.
Additional cable trays for instrumentation and
heater cable are specified on preliminary instru-
mentation and Controls Drawings D-SK-RCé-4
through 9, D-RC6-7-6H, and D-RC6-7-6J.

Water

Process water for Building 7503 is taken from
the potable water system as described by Flow
Diagrams  D-2-02-054-1453 and D-2-02-054-1466
by the ARED Design Department. Basic criteria
were initially outlined by Design Memos 1-E-1,
6-B-2, and 9-C-5. Design criteria were established
by Construction Design Memos 7503-21 and
7503-37 for design of the system by the ORNL
Engineering and Mechanical Division.

The extent of design construction and testing
to date is described for the most part by Package A
drawings and specifications. In general, installed
equipment within Package A includes main supply
headers, isolation valves, and process water
pumps. Preliminary design was prepared for the
installation of the process water filter in Package
1.

The completion of the system external to the
cell was planned as a portion of Package Iil,
for which the ORNL Engineering and Mechanical
Division was assigned design and construction
responsibility, The ARED Design Department
was assigned the responsibility for design and
procurement of the system inside the cell as a
portion of Package |V; construction was assigned
to the ORNL Engineering and Mechanical Division.

The Instrumentation and Controls Division had
responsibility for design and procurement of
instrument components within the system and
coresponsibility with the ORNL Engineering and
Mechanical Division for installation.

In addition to normal hydrostatic testing, the
portion of the water system in communication
with the cell was planned to be stringently vacuum
leak tested in order to ensure adequate containment.
The sum of the leak rates for all auxiliary systems
which are a part of the containment system has
been restricted to 0.002 cc per second.

Air

Compressed air facilities have been provided in
Building 7503 for the following purposes: (1) instru-
ment air for use outside the cell, (2) laboratories

.

for chemistry and solid-state physics, (3) heat
barrier door operators, (4) back flow damper
operators, and (5) cooling air for NaK purification
systems. The compressors and driers that were
installed according to ORNL Engineering and
Mechanical Division design for use with the ARE
have been dismantled and removed. However, it
was planned to use a portion of the existing
headers in Package Il design.

Original design criteria were established by
Design Memo 1-G-1 and schematically shown on
Flow Diagram D-2-02-054-1468.  Construction
Design Memo 7503-26 provided the design criteria.

Headers and isolation valves for pressure re-
ducing stations located in the auxiliary equipment
pit were installed in Package A in accordance with
ORNL Engineering and Mechanical Division design.

The portion of the system which was con-
structed in Package [IlA, in accordance with
ORNL Engineering and Mechanical Division
design, includes the following items: (1) two
vertical, carbon-ring 150 scfm at 150 psig Joy
compressors, (2) two after coolers, (3) two
receivers, {4) one 100 scfm at 125 psig, —~20°F
dew point temperature air drier, and (5) headers,
including isolation valves. The ORNL Engineering
and Mechanical Division has had the responsibility
for completion of design, procurement, and
construction of this system for Package Il except
for instrumentation, for which the Instrumentation
and Controls Division had responsibility for design
and procurement and coresponsibility with the
ORNL Engineering and Mechanical Division for
installation.

Diesel Fuel

Diesel fue! oil facilities were planned for
Building 7503 to permit continuous operation of
the five 300-hp diesel generator sets located in
the diesel generator house.

A  5000-gal storage tank, having sufficient
capacity for 24 hours of operation, a supply header,
and valving were designed by K-25 Plant Engi-
neering and installed in Package I.

The remainder of the system, consisting of a day
tank, transfer pump, and associated piping for
each diesel generator set, was designed by the
ORNL Engineering and Mechanical Division and
installed in Package I,

This system was completed except for change-out
of the day tank vent lines to improve venting.

23
Nitrogen

Nitrogen facilities were planned for Building
7503 to provide an oxygen-free atmosphere for
the cell and junction panels and for instrumentation
use.

Basic criteria were originated in Design Memo
1-H-1 and schematically shown on ARED Design
Department Flow Sheet D-2-02-054-1465. Design
criteria were provided by Construction Design
Memo 7503-17.

The existing ARE helium reserve banks were
incorporated in the nitrogen system in accordance
with Package A design by the ORNL Engineering
and Mechanical Division. Package A design and
construction also included distribution headers and
valving.

Completion of the system outside the cell was
scheduled in Package Ill, the ORNL Engineering
and Mechanical Division having the design,
procurement, and construction responsibility.
Design of the system inside the cell was assigned
to the ARED Design Department under Package V.
Construction of the system within the cell was
assigned to the ORNL Engineering and Mechanical
Division. Instrumentation components were to be
designed and procured by the Instrumentation and
Controls Division and were to be installed jointly
with the ORNL Engineering and Mechanical
Division.

Yacuum leak testing was planned for the ‘‘cell
containment’’ portion of the system.

Modifications to the nitrogen reserve banks
would be required in order to permit hydrostatic
testing and leak testing of welding done in
Package A.

Helium

The helium system for Building 7503 was
intended to serve as the principal gas system for
instrumentation.

Basic criteria for the system were furnished in
Design Memo 1-B-1 and Flow Diagram D-2-02-
054-1463. Design criteria for the system are
contained in Construction Design Memo 7503-18.

The extent of design and construction is described
by Package A drawings and specifications which
were prepared by the ORNL Engineering and
Mechanical Division.

The completion of this system for both design
and construction was scheduled in two packages.
The ORNL Engineering and Mechanical Division
was to have the responsibility for design, pro-
curement, and construction of the system external

24

to the cell under Package Ill and was to have
construction responsibility for the system inside
the cell under Package IV. ARED was to have
design and procurement responsibility for the
system inside the cell under Package IV. The
Instrumentation and Controls Division had design
and procurement responsibility for all instru-
mentation items within this system and was to have
coresponsibility with the ORNL Engineering and
Mechanical Division for construction.

In addition to the normal testing for this type of
system, the ‘‘cell containment’ portion was
scheduled to receive the most stringent vacuum
leak test possible using a Consolidated Engineering
Corp. leak detector.

Lube Qil

Two lubricating oil systems were planned for
Building 7503, one to supply lubricating oil for
the reactor pumps and the other for the NaK pumps.

Basic criteria for these systems are found in
Design Memos 1-D-1, 1-D-2, and 1-D-3 and Flow
Diagrams E-2-02-054-1461 and E-2-02-054-1462.
At the time of this report the flow diagrams were in
the process of being revised. Design criteria for
these systems are found in Construction Design
Memo 7503-27.

The extent of design and construction is
described by Package A and Package [IA
drawings and specifications, which were prepared
by the ORNL Engineering and Mechanical Division.

Completion of these systems for both design
and construction was scheduled in two packages.
The ORNL Engineering and Mechanical Division
was to have the responsibility for design, pro-
curement, and construction of both systems
external to the cell under Package Il and was to
have construction responsibility for the reactor
lube oil system within the cell under Package IV.
Preliminary drawings of the reactor lube oil
system were prepared by the ARED Design De-
partment under Package 1V,

The Instrumentation and Controls Division had
design and procurement responsibility for all instru-
mentation items within these systems and was to
have coresponsibility with the ORNL Engineering
and Mechanical Division for construction.

In addition the normal testing for this type of
system, both of these systems were scheduled
to receive the most stringent vacuum leak test
possible with a Consolidated Engineering leak
detector.

 

 
 

Waste Oil

A waste oil system was devised to permit
temporary storage of radiocctive lubricating oils
at Building 7503 prior to final burial or other
disposition.

Basic criteria for this system are found in Design
Memos 1-D-1, 1-D-2, and 1-D-3 and Flow Diagram
E-2-02-054-1461. Design criteria for this system
are found in Construction Design Memo 7503-27.

The general design and construction of this
system are described by Package IlIIA drawings
and specifications, which were prepared by the
ORNL Engineering and Mechanical Division.

The fill and vent lines were asphalt-coated
and the ditch was backfilled; however, the 500-gal
storage tank has been removed and is being stored
in the building.

Although no definite permissible leak rate was
established for this system, the Operations Group
felt that a leak rate of approximately 30 micron
cubic feet per hour would be permissible.

The piping was hydrostatically tested with
Freon at 300 psig and tested with a halide torch.
No leaks were found.

The pressure vessel was hydrostatically tested
at 193.5 psig with water and was leak tested by the
vendor with a 45-psig Freon air test, using a halide
torch. No leaks were found.

After installation of the tank and piping, vacuum
leak testing of the system was initiated, a
Consolidated Engineering leak detector being
used. By means of a standard leak, it was
established that a leak of the order of 5 micron
cubic feet per hour could be found, with, however,
the poor response time of 6 minutes at the ex-
tremity of the system. Probing with helium revealed
only a leak on the ]/Q-in. nitrogen pipe to the tank,
which had been damaged in shipment. Nevertheless,
a “‘leak-up'’’ test indicated a system leakage of
approximately 80 micron cubic feet per hour. A
“‘leak-up’’ test of the vent line and fill line
independently showed leakage rates of 1 and
70 micron cubic feet per hour, respectively. At the
time of termination of the test, the location of the
leak in the fill line had not been determined.

Hydraulic Oil

The criteria for the hydraulic system for
actuation of the ART louver operators are described
in detail by Design Memo 5-D-3. Design criteria
for this system are found in Construction Design

Memo 7503-38.

American Foundry & Furnace Company designed,
constructed, and tested the louvers and the
operators for the louvers in accordance with
Specification JS-P3-18.

Hicks & Ingle Company designed, constructed,
and tested the louver hydraulic pumping unit in
accordance with the ‘‘Specification for Louver
Hydraulic Pumping Unit'" as a part of the
Package IlIA specifications.

Design, construction, and testing of the inter-
connecting piping, which has been installed, are
described by Package llIA drawings and specifi-
cations, which were prepared by the ORNL
Engineering and Mechanical Division.

The remainder of the design, construction, and
testing of the system was scheduled as the
responsibility of the ORNL Engineering and
Mechanical Division.

Rerouting of the lines to the special louver
operators was planned in order to ensure that the
lines would not pass through areas hotter than
167°F. The existing lines pass through the main
duct annulus, which may have a temperature as
high as 300°F.

It was planned that couplings would be welded
to the oil filters on the hydraulic pumping unit and
that valves would be attached to permit venting
during system startup.

Instrumentation and power connections for the
system were scheduled as joint design and con-
struction efforts by the Instrumentation and
Controls Division and the ORNL Engineering and
Mechanical Division.

Penthouse Cooling

The penthouse cooling system has as its purpose
the maintaining of a temperature no greater than
167°F in the penthouse to permit the use of
electric motors, solenoid valves, etc., in this area.

The system consists of two air-circulating,
water-cooled finned heat exchangers serving as
heat dumps and forming closed air loops with the
penthouse. Design criteria for this system are
found in Construction Design Memo 7503-13.

The extent of design and construction to date is
described by Package | drawings and specifications.
In general the two cooling circuits external to the
penthouse dare compliete except for final closure
and testing of the containment cabinets.

Design and construction of this system within
the penthouse were the responsibility of the ORNL
Mechanical Division under

Engineering and
Package Ill.

 

 
5. PROCESS

Off-Gas and Yent

The off-gas and vent systems serve to contain
radioactively dangerous gases from pumps, lube
oil packages, NaK dump tanks, reactor, fuel
dump tank, etc., and also serve to distribute the
gases either to a point of dilution in the main air
duct or to the retention point for decay, the
charcoal adsorber pit.

Basic criteria for these systems are found in
Design Memos 7-A.1, 7-A.2, 7-B-1, and 7-B-2
and Flow Diagram D-2-02-054-1464 by the ARED
Design Department,

The construction completed to date is a vent
line from the auxiliary equipment room to the
radiator pit for the lube oil packages shown on
Package A drawings and a branch vent line for
the waste qil tank shown on Package l1lA drawings.

Drawings of the charcoal adsorber piping were
prepared by the ORNL Engineering and Mechan-
ical Division for Package. lIl installation. Al-
though specifications were prepared for ‘‘out-
side’ shop fabrication of the charcoal adsorber
piping, the ORNL Engineering and Mechanical
Division had indicated a preference for fabrication
to be done by the ORNL shops. It was planned
to revise the drawings to show thermocouple
wells and equipment for vacuum testing.

The remainder of these systems outside the
cell was scheduled for design and construction
in Package IIl by the ORNL Engineering and
Mechanical Division. The remainder of these
systems inside the cell was scheduled for design
by the ARED Design Department and construction
by the ORNL Engineering and Mechanical Di-
vision in Package |V. Instrumentation items
were to be designed by the Instrumentation and
Controls Division and jointly installed by this
Division and the ORNL Engineering and Mechanical
Division.

Installation design of these systems within the
vent house was dependent upon development of
information on the instrumentation items, which
was to be delayed as a result of higher priority
ETU work.

VYacuum leak testing was a requirement for these
systems outside the cell and was expected to be
extremely time-consuming and troublesome as o
result of the very low leak rates that would be
acceptable. [t had been planned to exercise the
utmost care in cleaning and fabricating the system,

26

Complete procedures covering materials, cleaning,

fabrication, and testing were to be prepared by

the ORNL Engineering and Mechanical Division.
Air

The process cir system was intended to serve
as the heat sink for the ART,

Basic criteria for this system are found in
Design Memos 5-A.1, 5-A-2, 5.A.3, 5-C-1, 5-D-1,
5-D-3, and 5-E-1 and flow diagram E-2-02-054-1467
by ARED Design Department. Design criteria for
this system are furnished by Construction Design
Memos 7503-6, -10, -13, -15, -29, and -36.

The extent of construction to date is described
by Package [ drawings by K-25 Plant Engineering.
In general the following items have been con-
structed:  blower house, main duct (except at
radiators), stack, installation of two main blowers
with backflow dampers, and the setting of two
main annulus blowers,

Items which have been specified and procured
by ARED and theirrespective specification numbers
are as follows: (1) main blowers and backflow
dampers, JS-P3-16, (2) special main blowers and
special annulus blowers with backflow dampers,
JS-P3-28, and (3) main and special louver dampers,
JS-P3-18.

Design and procurement of the main annulus
blowers were accomplished under Package I.

All other mechanical and structural items re-
quired for this system were scheduled for design,
procurement, and installation by the ORNL
Engineering and Mechanical Division in Package
Hl.  The Instrumentation and Controls Division
had responsibility for design and procurement of
atl instrumentation and joint responsibility with
the ORNL Engineering and Mechanical Division
for installation under Package Ill. A tabulation

of drawings completed or scheduled for this system
is found in the Appendix (Table D-1),

Coolant

The coolant in the ART served as an inter-
mediate heat exchange medium between the re-
actor, together with its dump tank, and the ultimate
heat sink, the atmosphere,

Basic criteria for these systems are found under
Section 5 of the Design Memo Book and on Flow
Diagram F-2.02-054-1470. Design criteria for
these systems are found in Construction Design
Memos 7503-15, -23, -29, -30, and -32,

No construction has been done on this system,

 

 
Design and procurement of components within
the system were the responsibility of ARED.,
The ORNL Engineering and Mechanical Division
had the design and construction responsibility for
installation of the components and their associated
piping as a part of Package |Il work. The Instru-
mentation and Controls Division was responsible
for design and procurement of instrumentation
items and jointly responsible with the ORNL
Engineering and Mechanical Division for instal-
lation under Package lfl work. A tabulation of
the drawings completed or scheduled for this
system is found in the Appendix,

Fabrication, cleaning, welding, and testing
procedures were to be the responsibility of the
ORNL Engineering and Mechanical Division.

The installation and testing of this system were
expected to be extremely time-consuming. Vacuum
leak testing was a requirement in order to ensure
that leakage for the cell and the systems forming
an integral portion of the containment, including
therefore these systems, would not exceed 0.002 cc
per second. In addition it was believed that
the extremely crowded condition of the equipment
in the penthouse and duct areas would present
difficult and time-consuming problems not only

upon installation but also during change-out of
any equipment such as radiators or pumps.

As would be expected in a development program
of this nature, space allocation prior to the final
development of all equipment presented a difficult
problem, In particular the space requirements
of the coolant purification equipment, the instru.
mentation, and the coolant radiators were found
to be considerably greater than they were initially
anticipated to be., Furthermore the attempt to
minimize coolant inventory prevented obtaining
sufficient pipe flexibility except by permitting
the coolant pumps and radiators to float free on
constant spring hangers, thereby complicating
installation and dismantling procedures as well
as promoting an even more crowded condition,

Fluid Enricher

The fluid enricher was designed and procured
by ARED and was being stored at Building 7503
prior to installation in the cell under Package IV
work by the ORNL Engineering and Mechanical
Division,

Basic criteria for this system are found in
Design Memo 4-l-1 and on Flow Diagram E-2-02-
054-1469 by the ARED Engineering Department.

*Liquidated damages charge not invoked because of contract deviations plus equipment delivery delays resulting
from Westinghouse strike.

**Liquidated damages charge not invoked because government-furnished diesel generators were damaged in ship-
ment, causing extensive equipment delivery delay. Contract extension was granted for excessive amount of time be-
yond the contractor’s control required for performance of the specified diesel tests.

**The February budget assumed the reactor would be manifolded, shielded, and ready for installation in the 7503
cell; consequently, no requirements for any such work were included. in addition, it is now apparent that provision
for lead shielding of the off-gas system is grossly inadequate in the February budget, Also it should be noted that
this evaluation is made without benefit o? budget information from the Instrumentation and Controls Div. since

February 1, 1957.
