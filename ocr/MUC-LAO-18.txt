RO The first specler was Mr. P. Yorrizon; his camuents follow: I9
N i we view the chain reaction merely s a source of uwnsoscializsd energy,?i‘b,

g N goes directly into competition with the many eccisting large scals prAge™
G N movers and fuel sources.

Eccnonics are then paramomnt. It is My. Morrison'€r '
opinion that we should not move in that divection for sone time to come, _
but should attampt vo exploit the particular properties of the chain re- '
acticn as a conceatrated source of a highly special form of energy. Power « '
simply as Ilw hours shouid appear at most as a by-produci.

Tha £iguee for the coal-steam. plant is based on the fuel cost oaly and does
not include the eowloment, maintenancs, ete. As Mr., Szilard poinved out,
thess two camnot be compared end, as Mr. Fermi observed, it ls the 80¢
figurs of the coal-steam plents with which we must compebe in the productien
of power. .

As Mr, :.Iomson noved in a recent memorandun, the mpv'o:d.mate

atundance of tubealloy and thorium in the top crust (5 to 8 ku thick) of

thoe sarta is as fol.l.omr

Tubealloy 14, '—"- 2 ppuw- (i'oimd mostly in graniite and docs
not include sends, etc.) .-

Thoriva =~ 12 x L ppn  (found mostly in sedimentary vocks)

“he most officlend golci extraction plant yet consbrucied has besaa aba.e to
dlz the rock, crush it, treat it; sitc. to recover the gold for about $7-CJ
per ton. Crushing rock requires about 100 kw hours per ton when the rock
1s reduced to parvicles of aboub 1 fn3 in size. Therefore, r. Morrison

-estimates that we could afford to woric ths rock for power (based on using
- the 25, not the 28), if necassary, providing the sbundance of the tubsalloy

was not less than 5 vo 10 ppm. It has been estimatved that there are about
10t% - 1015 tons o; natural tubealloy to be found in xock in the earthl!s
crust and about 105 tons in sea water (the concentration in sea water is
about 10~9 pms of tubezlloy por gm of water).

" The richast occurences of natural tubaalloy in the world are at
the following locatlons. All figurcs are very rough estimatec based cn
dnconolete and often reluctent surveys by the producers. All tomnage
Pigures ure tons of tubeslley and not ore.

U.s. (mainly Cclorado vanadium ores or Carno-
tite, having a content of about XI tubu-
elloy. Letimated st 3,000 tons of tube-

alloy available in 1925.) - " about 5,000 tons
in sight. .
Czech  {(also about 1% content) sbout 1,000 tons

remaining.

-3 =~

Congo (of five sites total, one was estimavcd
in 1925 at not less than 5,000 tons of about 5,000 toas
ore having 20 tubealloy content) in sight.

Canada (although other deposits undoubbedly
exist, the inown devosits containing

20 to 50% tubealloy conteut ors have) about 5,000 toms.
Russia (1 to 2% tubealloy content Carnotite not less than
vanadium ore depasifs) | 3,000 toas in sight.

Togual about 20,CC0 taons of tube-
alloy in sight. .

. A similar table of the distribution of ‘thorium throughoui the
vorld follows. Thls is found almost entiraly in menszite sand hawving
about 5 to 11% thorium content. - .

U.S. (mainly in North Carolina with a small

| amount in Icaho and Florida) about 1,000 ions.
Prazil (on the coast) | : about: 8 ,000 toms.
British India ‘ about 150,000 tens.
Netherland East Indies may have about

5,000 tous.

If we were to use the entire U.S. and Canadian resources of
tubeailoy (10,000 tons) using a ¥ of 0.9 amd wiilizing only the 25 and .
not the 23, we would have an equivelent replacement factor of only nine
months for the total powse consumpvion of the U.S. opr about ten yesars for
the hydropower. ' o

The second speaker was Mr. Szilerd who continued his discussion
froa the previous meoting. He recapped fivst the thrse possibilitios as
hs saw then. .

(1) Unseparated tﬁbealloy'-—)h‘) production
(2) Enriched tubeslloy —49 productlion
(2) slow chain reaction
(b) fast chaln reaction
(3) Mriched tubcelloy—-~3no 49 production

capture remains constant. Szilard therefore assumes that, in a mixburs
ol 222 and Plutonium, EV, = 1.2 x 2.5 = 3.0 neutrons emitived per thermally
fissicnable atom destroyed and this would mean that thers is a net gain of
one thermally fissionzble atom per similar atom destroyed.

Referring to item (3), Szilard emphasized one possibility, i.e.,
the burning of Plutonium in a slow recaction and absorbing the neutrons by -
bismuth to give Poloniuvm. Of the heat dissipated when Plutonium is des-
troyed to give Polonium, only about 3% would be stored in the Polonium.
However, this energy will be available for use free of ‘6’ radiation and
could be used for driving airplanes, etc.

In the discussion following, Ferml questioned the estimated
value of L/, = 2.5 on ths ground that it might be too optimistic and
pointed out that there 1s a long range future in developing the full utili-
zation of 28 and thorium.

Viigner questioned the feasibility of the rotating disc arrange-
ment described at the previous meeting on the ground of poisoning and .
questioned the 4} year investment return. He felt this would probably be
more nearly 10 to 20 years by which time, as Mr. Morrison suggested, we
nay be burning water.

After discussion, Szilaird expressed his view that item 2a is of
more immediate concern than 2b.

Mr. Morrison suggested that more work should be done on the nuc-
lear development of thorium bscause of its greater availability and also
suggested experiments to obtain Wipg and other useful constants,

M. Ohlinger explained very briefly an outlired program, of which
a copy is attached hereto. This program for :consideration of future trends
in the laboratory work, is a compllation of the independent results of the
"homatiork" recuested at an earlier meeting. It has bsen assembled to give
a majority concensus of the classification of possibilities.

In general, the outline is first divided into three main groups
based on the use to vhich a pile would bz put. Thereafter, the potent-
ialities are subdivided for easy consideration. An open discussion oi' thls
outline will occur al the next mesting on Fridsy, May Sth.

IT. ISOTOPK PHODUCTION (49 or 23 produced)

(Since its purposc is well defined and there are no limitations on
slze, lack of mobility and power produced, oxecpt by the ogerating potentialities

of the design chosen, these factors arc not outlined heras.

TTi. RODIATION SQURCE (High levels of intensity)

(Since the purpose is well defined and size, mobility and povier preduced
are not criteria, they are not outlined here. However, such a pile must be
flexible with the ability to reach high levels of intensity and expose mater-
jals or takc measurements with ease. TFlux: and not total power inportant
here. HMost suitable of piles defined in II to be chosen as experimental
machine. Routine metal removal is not important.)
