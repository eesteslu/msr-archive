DESIGN -OF AN ENG.NEERING-SCALE, "VACUUM DISTILLATION
EXPERIMENT FOR MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR FUEL

W. L. Carter
R. B. Lindaver
L. E. McNeese

ABSTRACT

Experimental equipment has been designed for an engineering=- -
scale demonstration of vacuum distillation of molten-salt reactor fuel.
The distillation is carried out at about 1000° C and 1 mm Hg to
separate LiF-BeF, carrier salt from less volatile fission products,
primarily the rare earths, Uranium tetrafluoride is not present
during the distillation. - The experiment is designed for continuously
feeding a molten-salt-fission=product mixture into a still at the
same rate that distillate is being removed, thereby concentrating
fission products in the still. Also, the still may be operated batch-
wise to give large concentration factors. Frequent sampling of the

~ distillate furnishes data on the separation between carrier and fission
products as a function of concentration in the still bottoms.

‘The equipment consists of a 48-liter feed tank, a 12-liter
still, a 10~in. diam x 51-in. condenser, a 48-liter condensate receiver,
plus associated temperature, pressure and level control instrumen-
" tation.  All vessels and parts contacted by molten salt are made of
Hastelloy N.  The unit is electrically heated by shell-type, ceramic
heaters.

About 90% of the experimental program will be devoted to

. nonradioactive operation using mixtures of LiF, BeF,, ZrF,, and
selected rare earth fluorides. The experiment will be concluded
by distilling a 48~liter-batch of uranium-free spent fuel from the
~ Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment. o |

 
 

 

 

INTRODUCTION

- This report describes the design and proposed use of experimental equipment
to demonstrate vacuum distillation of fuel carrier salt from a .molten-salt reactor.
The purpose of this experiment is to demonstrate the feasibility of distilling a large
portion of the carrier from contained fission product fluorides. - Vacuum distillation
is the key step in one method of processing a molten-salt breeder (see Fig. 1)
because it separates the bulk of the valuable LiF~BeFy carrier from less volatile
fission products, primarily the rare earths, and recovers this carrier salt for recycle
to the reactor. Feasibility of dnshllmg fluoride salts was established in batch,
laboratory experiments by Kelly this design is of an experiment that will demon-
strate the operation on an engineering scale.

In the interest of simplicity, fabrication time, and economy, no attempt was
made in this experiment to reproduce the actual operating conditions, such as
high internal heat generation rate in the molten salt, or to use a still design of the
type to be used in a processing plant for a breeder. Such advances are the next
logical step after an engineering~scale demonstration. However, it is the purpose
of this experiment to show that molten salt, containing fission products, can be fed
continuously to the still at the rate at which it is being distilled, with the simul-
taneous accumulation of fission products in the bottoms. Furthermore, the still can
be operated batchwise to concentrate fission products in some small fraction of the
salt volume. In this way the still meets a requirement of a still for processing
breeder fuel since large fission product concentration factors are necessary to mini~
 mize the amount of carrier salt discarded as waste.

The experiment is designed to obtain throughput data and relative volatility
data between rare earth fluorides and the carrier components of molten salt fuel,
which are LiF, BeF,, and ZrF4. Zirconium fluoride will not be a component of
breeder reactor fu % but it is mcluded here because the still will be operated with
salt of the composition of the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE), which is
65 mole % LiF, 30 mole % BeF,, and S mole % ZrF4. Progress of distillation is
followed by sampling the flowing condensate at several times during the course of
an experiment. Samples can be removed under vacuum without interrupting the
run and will be analyzed to determine the amount of separation being obtained
~ between components being fed to the still. It is also possible to sample the contents
of the still, but this necessitates interrupting the run during the time a sample is
being removed. .

The experimental program is in two parts: About 90% of the time will be

- devoted to nonradioactive operation, and the remaining 10% to radiocactive

operation in distilling a-small quantity of fuel carrier salt from the MSRE, The first |
phase is expected to log about 500 hr of operation. The same equipment will be u
used in the radicactive experiment after being thoroughly inspected at the conclusion

of nonradioactive operation.  Radioactive runs will be carried out in an MSRE cell

on a 48-liter batch of uranium=-free MSRE fuel that has been decayed at least

 two months.

Components of the experiment are a feed tank (48 liters), still (12 liters),
condenser, condensate receiver (48 liters), associated temperature_and pressure
instrumentation, and o vacuum system. The still, condenser, and receiver are
fabricated as a unit. The vessels are mounted in an angle~iron frame, which is
3 x 6 x 7 ft high, allowing transport of the entire facility as a unit once
instrumentation, power, and service lines have been disconnected. . The equupment
is heated by shell-type electric heaters which are enclosed in 4 to 8 in. of thermal
insulation. - |

An experimental run is carried out by charging a molten mixture of carrier
salt and fission product fluorides into the feed tank, which is held at a temperature
slightly above the salt liquidus, which is 450°C for MSRE carrier salt. Concurrently
the still, condenser, and condensate receiver are heated and evacuated, and the

~ space above the liquid in the feed tank is evacuated. The final pressure is adjusted

to about 0.5 atm in the feed tank and 0.2 to 5 mm Hg in the rest of the equipment,
depending upon the desired operating pressure. When the still temperature reaches
900°C, a 12 liter charge is forced into the still through a heated line; and the
temperature is raised to the operating temperature range of 950 to 1000°C.

The still pot is the highest point of the system and is an annular volume surround-
ing the top of the condenser (see Fig. 2). Salt vapors flow into the top of the
condenser and condense along its length by losing heat to the surroundings. Freezing
is prevented by supplying the necessary external heat to keep the condenser surface
above the liquidus temperature. In leaving the condenser the distillate passes
through a small cup from which samples can be removed for analyses. Sampling can
be done under vacuum without interrupting an experiment.

Liquid-level instrumentation in the still allows control of feed rate to correspond

to the distillation rate, which is estimated to be 400 to 500 em3 distillate per hour.

Determining the actual distillation rate for molten-salt systems is an important part
of this experiment.

All vessels and lines that contact molten salt are. fabricated of Hastelloy N.
In the region of the still and upper section of the condenser, the normal use témper-

" ature for this alloy may be exceeded by as much as 200°C. Consequently, the

vessels are to be examined thoroughly by dimensional, radiographic, and ultrasonic
methods before and after nonradicactive operation.

Provision is made for hanging test specimens of candidate metals of construction
in the still. The materials that will be tested are:

DESIGN. CRITERIA AND FEATURES

Basic Design Requirements
- |

Factors which influenced ':equipment design included the following:

1. The total operating time and the total volume of salt distilled during
- operation with irradiated material should be sufficient to conclusively
demonstrate the feasibility of molten=salt distillation.

2. Operation with irradiated material should be preceded by successful
operation with unirradiated material.

3. The same equipment should be used for work with irradiated and
unirradiated materials.

4. The equipment size should be compatible with space suitable for
containment of Bef, during nonradioactive operation.

Other factors of importance included:
1. Either semicontinuous or batch operation should be possible.

2. Condensate samples should be taken during an experiment without
upsetting operating conditions.

3. The latent heat of condensation of the molten—salt vapor should be
removed from the condenser by loss of heat to the surréundings.

4. The pressure drop in the passage connecting the vaporization and
condensation surfaces should be low.

~ o
The experimental program will consist of both nonradioactive and radicactive
- operation, with the former being about 90% of the program. Nonradioactive
operation will be carried out over a period of three to six months in the

Unit Operations Section, and then the equtpment will be moved i in jg_fg_ to the
MSRE site to demonstrate vacuum distillation of irradiated MSRE carrier salt. |
Equipment size was governed by the space in an available hood, and the overall
installation is limited to about 6 x 3 x 8 ft in length, width, and height

respectively. Unitized installation of all components within a supporting frame-

work was designated to facilitate transport between sites. Radioactive operation
will be carried out in the spare cell of the MSRE.

The duration of the radioactive experiment is an important factor because of
the technological significance that can be associated with a conclusive demonstration
using recently irradiated fuel. For this purpose, an operating period of 10 to 14 days
was considered adequate, and, during this time, 48 liters of the fuel carrier salt will

be distilled.

Another design feature is that provision be made for sampling the condensate
stream at any time during the course of a distillation experiment. This requirement
is made so that the composition of the still vapor can be measured as a function of
still composition and/or temperature. Condensed vapors flow contindously through

~ a cup at the condenser outlet (see drawing M~12173-CD-011D in the Appendix)

from which a 10-g sample can be taken by lowering a thimble into the cup. The
sampling operation is carried out at the operating pressure, causing no interruption
or upset in the run.

Simplicity of design and ease of operation were primary considerations in
planning this experiment. The only auxiliary systems are the necessary heaters,
instruments, and vacuum equipment. Vapor condensation is brought about by
radiative and convective heat loss to the surroundings, obviating the need for an
auxiliary, high-temperature cooling system. This somewhat limits the maximum
distillation rate, the calculated range being 350 to 500 cm3/hr with 3.5 to 4~in.

insulation around the condenser.

Material of Construction

All major pieces of equipment and connechng lines are built of Hastelloy N.
This material has excellent resistance to corrosion by molten LiF-BeFy=ZrF, mixture
at the lower temperatures (500 to 700°C) of the experiment. A limited amount of
data at the higher operatlng temperatures (200 to 1000° C) indicate that the
corrosion resistance is probably quute good at these temperatures. This characteristic

“of Hastelloy N will be evaluated in the distillation experiment.

The still and condenser, which will be exposed to the higher temperatures, are -

constructed of 3/8-in.~thick plate to allow for uncertainty in the strength of Hastelloy

N in the neighborhood of 1000°C. The ASME Unfired Boiler and Pressure Vessel

‘Code makes no provision for the use of this alloy for service above 700°C. This

 
 

 

 

8

design is based on the creep data of McCoy* and the stress analysis of Hahs and
Pickel,* which substantiate the use of this equipment for an operating time up to

- 1000-hr duration. At no time will the unit be exposed to a positive internal
pressure, the largest AP being 1 atm external pressure.

Use was made of on-hand material from the MSRE stockpile of Hastelloy N
plate, sheet, tubing, rod, and pipe. Design and fabrication changes were made

- to conform to the available material, For example, cylindrical vessels are made

of rolled and welded plate instead of the more obvious choice of using standard
pipe if it were available; directional changes are made with mitered joints because.

- pipe fittings were not available; some nozzles are made of tubing or drilled rod

when a more conventional choice would have been standard pipe.
EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM

The vacuum distillation experiment will be carried out in two phases. The
first phase will consist of a large number of nonradioactive experiments to thoroughly
evaluate the still, obtain operating experience, and gather data that are pertinent
to the distillation process. The second phase will be a 10 to 14 day demonstration

in which irradiated carrier salt of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment will be
distilled in a cell at the MSRE site.

Nonradioactive Operation

- The experiment is described by the simplified flow diagram presented in Fig. 2;
a detailed flowsheet is given in Appendix H, Drawing No. E~12173-CD-012D.
The system consists of a feed tank, still, condenser, condensate receiver, cold trap,
vacuum pump, and auxiliary instrumentation for controlling pressures, temperatures,
and liquid level. All vessels and lines are heated with ceramic, clam-shell-type:
heaters or Calrod-type elements. |

Initially the system is purged and filled with argon to remove oxygen, .and all
vessels are heated to about 500°C. A 48-liter charge of molten LiF-BeFy=ZrFy
of MSRE carrier salt composition containing a fission product fluoride is then put
into the feed tank, and the entire system is evacuated. Pressure above the salt in
the feed tank is adjusted to about 5 psia, sufficiently low to prevent salt from being
pulled into the still when the still is at full vacuum. The evacuation is continued

until the still, condenser, and condensate receiver are at the desired operating

pressure of 0.2 to 2 mm Hg. Concurrently with the evacuation, the still
temperature is raised to about 850°C, the temperature at which the salt charge
has a vapor pressure of around 1 mm Hg. The condenser temperature is adjusted
100 to 200°C lower than the still temperature to facilitate condensation of the
salt vapor without solidification. Condenser heat is applied in four zones so that
a high-to-low temperature gradient can be maintained down its length, The
condensate receiver is heated to 500 to 550°C, a temperature that will keep the
condensate molten but not cause undesired vaporization into the vacuum system.

When all parts of the sysfem have reached the desired temperature ond pressure,
12 liters of the feed salt are transferred through a heated line into the annular
section of the still by pressurizing the feed tank with argon. The gas is added
slowly through a capillary, and a liquid-level device, which senses the upper level
in the still, stops the argon addition when this level is reached. The still
temperature is controlled so that the vapor pressure of the salt is near 1 mm Hg; and,
as distillation progresses,changing the salt composition, this temperature is allowed
to increase to keep the vapor pressure at about 1 mm Hg. Pressure at the condenser
exit is held at about 0.5 mm Hg. The calculated distillation rate is about 350 ml/hr.

The liquid-level instrument in the still is set to detect a low level that
corresponds to vaporization of 2 liters and to begin argon flow into the feed tank to
push more salt into the still. The upper-level setting stops the addition, and this
cyclic operation is repeated throughout the run. Smoother, more continuous
operation can be obtained by regulating the argon flow to the feed tank to be very
near the predicted vaporization rate so that salt flows into the still at about the
same rate that it is being vaporized.

In leaving the condenser, the condensate flows through a small cup that is
centered beneath a sample tube. A 4~cm3 sample is obtained by lowering a
1-1/2-in. by 3/4=in.~diameter thimble into the cup. Sampling is done under

‘operating conditions with no interruption in the experiment; a double-valve

arrangement (shown schematically in Fig. 2) permits removal of a sample from the
system without upsetting the still pressure. The sample cup is continuously flushed
with fresh condensate, giving a sample that is representative of the still vapor at
the time the sample is taken. -

Flnally, the condensate collects in a receiver from whu:h it mrght be recycled

~ for subsequent experiments. Level-detecting instrumentation allows an independent

check of distillation rate. The condensate receiver can be sampled for a cumulative
analysis only if the run is terminated because the tank must be pressurized to force
the salt out the drain line. The vacuum line passes through a baffled trap cooled
by liquid nitrogen to remove particulates or vapors that might clog the vacuum pump.

- The still residue cannot be withdrawn during the course of an éxperiment. A
dip tube is provided for draining all but about 154 em3 from the conical bottom

section when a positive pressure is applied above the liquid surface. However, if
desired, all liquid fed into the still may be evaporated. The maximum still temper-
ature (1000°C) is high enough to vaporize the least volatile component (LiF) of the
carrier but considerably below the point at which rare earth fluorides have a
significant vapor pressure. Fission product fluorides, which the carrier salt contains
during some runs, are allowed to accumulate in the still. A flush salt can be used
to purge the still between different types of experiments. |

Because of the toxic nature of beryllium, nonradicactive experiments are
carried out in a hood, and all work areas are monitored for beryllium contamination.
Containment is based on maintaining adequate air velocities at all hood openings.

Radioactive Operation

At the conclusion of the nonradioactive experiments, the equipment will be

moved intact to the spare cell at the MSRE site for a similar experiment using

irradiated salt. Distillation is carried out in the same way as described above;
however, all operations must be remote. A 48-liter batch of LiF-BeFo-ZrF

MSRE carrier salt, which has been fluorinated to remove uranium and volatile fission
products, will be transferred from the chemical processing cell through an existing
pipe line into the feed tank. The salt will then be distilled over a period of

- 10 to 14 days. Frequent samples will be withdrawn for analysis. It is anticipated

that the extensive operating experience with nonradioactive experiments will allow
specifying operating conditions to obtain maximum decontamination and trouble-free
operation.

The cell ventilation system is used for disposol of gases from the experiment.
This system contains the necessary fllters for removing activity from the gas before
exhausting it to the atmosphere.

METHODS OF OPERATION

The distillation system can be operated in either of two modes: semicontinuous
operation followed by batch operation or batch operation with heel retention. These |
methods are not necessarily the best for MSBR processing; they are, however, well’
suited for demonstration of molten salt distillation at the MSRE site,

Instrumentation for measuring liquid level in the still includes a liquid-level
probe which operates when the still inventory is between 10 and 12 liters and a
level probe which operates when the still inventory is between 0.78 and 6 liters. |
Salt can be fed to the system continuously or intermittently; however, no provision is g
made for removing liquid from the vaporizer during the operation. During a given

¥

M
 

)

s

 

n

run, the total salt volume which will be distilled by either method of operation is
approximately 48 liters.

Semicontinuous Operation

For semicontinuous operation, the still will-be charged with 12 liters of MSRE
fuel salt (65 mole % LiF—30 mole % BeFy—5 mole % ZrF4) containing rare earth
fluorides. An additional 36 liters of fuel salt will then be fed to the still at a rate
equal to the desired distillation rate. The liquid volume in the still will be main-
tained between 10 and 12 liters during this period. After feeding 36 liters of salt,
the salt feed will be stopped and vaporization will be continued until the salt liquid
volume is 0.78 liter.

The variation of BeFy concentration in the condensate and the fraction of rare
earth flyoride vaporized are shown in Fig. 3 for this mode of operation. The liquid
volume in the still was assumed to be perfectly mixed and the relative volatilities of

- BeF, and rare earth fluoride were assumed to be 4.0 and 5 x 1074, respectively.

The BeF, concentration in the condensate is observed to decrease from an initial
valuve of 67 mole % to 35 mole % at the end of semicontinuous operation and then
to drop sharply to essentially zero during batch operation. The fraction of rare
earth vaporized is seen to continuously increase to a value of 0.0018 at the end of
operation. Approximately 98.5% of the salt fed to the still will be vaporized.

Batch Operation

For batch operation with heel retention, the still is charged initially with
12 [iters of MSRE fuel salt containing rare earth fluorides. Vaporization is then
carried out until the liquid volume in the still is 0.78 liter. Fuel salt (11.22 liters)
will be fed to the still to yield a total liquid volume of 12 liters and the above
sequence repeated.  Four cycles of batch operation with heel retention can be

- carried out with 48 liters of salt.

The variation of BeF, concentration in the condensate and the fraction of rare
earth fluoride vaporized is shown in Fig. 4. The liquid volume in the still was
assumed to be uniform in concentration and the relative volatilities of BeF, and
rare earth fluoride referred to LiF are assumed to be 4.0 and 5 x 10-4, respectively.
The fraction of rare earth fluoride vaporized is based on the total quantity of rare

“earth fluoride which has been fed to the still during a given cycle. The BeF,

concentration is observed to decrease from an initial value of 67 mole % to
essentially zero during each cycle. The fraction of the rare earth fluoride vaporized
after four cycles is 0.0027. Approximately 98.2% of the salt fed to the still will be
vaporized..

The distillation experiment will be operated with unirradiated fuel salt for
approximately 500 hr prior to operation with MSRE fuel salt which will require
approximately 150 hr. Experimental work using nonirradiated fuel salt will
provide general information on optimum operating conditions for the subsequent
work using irradiated salt as well as specific data such as relative volatilities of
rare earth fluorides and fuel salt components, vaporization rates and factors
affecting rate, and concentration polarization at the vapor-liquid interface.
Experimental work using irradiated fuel salt will provide additional information on
relative volatilities of rare earth fluorides and other fission product fluorides and
will point out problems associated with the remote operation of a dlshllahon system
with lrradlafed material.

" DESIGN OF EQUIPMENT

The major pieces of equipment for this experiment are designed for semicontinuous
or batch operation to concluslvely demonstrate vacuum distillation of molten-salt

reactor fuel on an engineering scale. The vessels are sized so that batch runs of

30 to 36 hr duration can be made. A batch operation can consist of distilling up
to 12 liters of salt, whereas a semicontinuous experiment can distill up to 48 liters
and operate for more than one week. The following paragraphs discuss the perhnenf
design characteristics of each piece of equipment.

Thermal Design

The thermal design of the feed tank was concerned only with determining the
required heat input rate to give a tolerable heat-up time from room temperature to
operating temperature (~ 500°C). After the vessel and contents have been heated
to 500°C, the only heat required is that needed to balance the heat loss to the
- surroundings. The heat-up time was calculated for several heat input rates, and
these are plotted in Fig. 6. An arbitrary upper limit of about 2 hr was chosen for
the heat-up period, and on this basis a 20-kw heat input is specified. The
calculations are based on the tank's bemg full (48 hfers) of L|F-BeF2-ZrF4 (65- 30 -
5.0 mole %) mixture.

At operating temperature, the calculated heat loss from the feed tank is 1.2 kw -
through the é=-in.~thick insulation. Heaters are arranged so that about 6 kw are

applied to the tank bottom, 4 kw to the top, and 10 kw to the sides.

A more complete treatment of the thermal analysis is given in Appendix D.

Operating Pressure

 

The feed tank is connected to the still via an open line that rises to a point
higher than the still and loops down to the still.” When the feed tank is filled,
molten salt must be raised 5.25 ft to the top of the loop; when near empty, salt must
be raised 7 ft (Drawing No. M=12173-CD-010-D in Appendix H). Since the still
operates at a pressure of about 1 mm Hg, the salt (sp gr = 2.22 at 500°C) will be
drawn into the still unless the feed tank is partially evacuated. . Feed tank pressure
must be kept in the range 5.0 to 6.7 psia, depending on the salt level in the tank.

Detailed design of the condensate receiver is shown on Drawing No. M-12173-CD-~
009-D in Appendix H.

Thermal Design

The same thermal design was used for the condensate receiver and the feed tank
because the dimensions and use of the two vessels are almost identical. The receiver
is surrounded on the sides and bottom by heaters rated at 20 kw, capable of heating a
full charge of salt from room temperature to 500°C in about 2 hr. At operating
temperature, heat loss to the surroundings through é-in. insulation is about 1.1 kw.

The heaters are arranged so that about 6 kw are applied to the tank bottom and
14 kw to the sides.

The temperature of the condensate tank is kept just slightly above the liquidus of
the contained salt so that the salt vapor pressure is negligible, A high temperature

~at this point would cause salt vapors to flow into the vacuum system.

Operating Pressure

Pressure in the condensate receiver must be kept lower than the vapor pressure
of the salt in the still so that these vapors will flow from the still into the condenser.
The receiver is kept at a pressure in the range 0.2 to 0.5 mm Hg, allowing a pressure
difference of at least 0.5 mm Hg between the still and receiver.

Still and Condenser

The still and condenser are designed as a unit with the condenser's vapor inlet
actually extending into the still. The still reservoir is the annular space between the
vapor line and the outer wall.  No provision is made for removing still bottoms from
the annulus during the course of an experiment; however, a dip-tube is provided to
allow removal of liquid between experiments. As shown in Fig. 8, the still and

~ condenser are joined in-an angular configuration; this was necessitated by the limited

headroom in fhe operational area.

' Design Features

 The data given.in Table 1 characterize the Still-condenser'unit and its operation.
Detailed design of the unit is shown on Drawmg M-12173-CD-011-D and M-12173-

The still annulus is about 13 in. deep by 2 in. thick and, when charged with
12 liters of salt, will be filled within about 1.43 in. of the top. Heat for distilling
the fluoride mixture is supplied by electric heaters surrounding - the sides and top. The
heat flux is small, being only about 1615 Btu hr™ V12 at o distillation rate of 420
cmS/hr.  The top of the still is kept a few degrees hotter than the still liquid to
preclude condensation.

In designing the still, care was used to avoid junctions that would produce large
stresses in the metal parts when the unit is heated from room temperature to 1000° C,

- The still=condenser unit elongates about 1 in. when heated over this temperature range.

The unit is supported by a cable and counterweight attached to the still so that move~
ment is not restricted.

The condenser is made relatively large (10 in. OD) to facilitate heat loss by the
greater surface areq, thereby increasing the attainable distillation rate. A cylindrical
core is placed inside the condenser to channel salt vapor into the annulus adjacent to
the outside wall where it is condensed and cooled. Three radiation shields are placed
inside this core at the high-temperature end to decrease the amount of heat received -
by the condenser from the 1000° C zone of the still.

Temperature Measurement

Temperature measurements are made at a number of points on the outside surfaces
of the still and condenser by attaching thermocouples to these surfaces. These exterior
readings should be very close to the temperatures inside the vessel because of the very
low heat flux (~ 1615 Btu hr=1 §1~2); the calculated temperature drop across the wall
is only 1.5°C. However, interior temperature measurements are made in the still
liquid at three different elevations by introducing thermocouples into wells extending
through the vessel head. The temperature of either a surface or interior thermocouple
can be selected as the reference temperature at which the still is operated.

- As to the condenser,,only outside~surface thermocouples are installed and selected
ones are used to control the wall temperature. There will be a temperature gradient
along the length of the condenser to allow the condensed vapor to cool to a temper-

“ature of only 25 to 30°C above the liquidus as it drops into the condensate receiver.

When the condensate composition is that of the MSRE carrier salt, LiF-BeF ~ZrFy
(65-30-5.0 mole %), the condenser temperature can be as low as 500° C; byt for
experiments in which nearly 100 mole % LiF is distilled, the condenser surface needs
to have a minimum temperoture of about 875°C. .

Operating Pressure and Distillation Rate

The upper limit of 1000°C on the operating temperature requires that the still
pressure be no greater than 1 ' mm Hg during most of a distillation experiment if

 
 

 

 

L

24
vaporization is to occur.  The initial salt composition has a vapor pressure of perhaps
10 mm Hg at 1000° C, but the more volatile BeFy quickly boils out, leaving an equi-
librium mixture whose vapor pressure is about 1 mm Hg. A pressure gradient is main-

tained through the condenser by evacuating the condensate receiver to 0.5 mm Hg or
less. The volumeiric flow rate of vapor from the still to the condenser depends upon

the pressure differential. The graph in Fig. 9 is a plot of the calculated flow rate of -

condensate as a function of the pressure at the condenser outlet. The pressure at the
liquid surface in the still was taken to be 1 mm Hg, and the vapor composition was

‘assumed to be that of MSRE carrier salt, namely, L|F-BeF2-ZrF (65-30-5 mole %).
The calculations indicate that the still will have a capacity of about 400 em /hr when

4~in. insulation surrounds the condenser.

. The same plot also shows the calculated distillation rate as a function of the
temperature of the condensing surface for insulation thicknesses of 3 in. and 4 in.
Satisfactory operation of the still is realized in the area to the left of these temper-
ature curves. Although the pressure curve was calculated for vapor of MSRE carrier
composition, it may be used with little error for vapors richer . in LiF. . For pure LiF
vapor the pressure at the condenser outlet needs to be about 3.5% lower than that of
MSRE carrier for comparable flow rates. However, the condensation temperature
must be considerably higher (>855°C) to preclude freezing.

Heat Rejection by Condenser
As stated above, the condenser rejects the latent heat of condensation of the salt

vapor by conduction through the thermal insulation to the surrounding atmosphere.
For this purpose the insulation is purposely made thinner (4 in.) than on other parts of

the equipment. The temperature of the condenser is maintained above the salt liquidus

by providing adequate heat input to the condenser. The rate of heat rejection is
directly dependent on the temperature difference between the condenser wall and the
surroundings, and the curves of Fig. 10 show this relationship over the temperature
range of interest in this experiment. The temperature at which the wall is held
depends on the vapor composition; that is, the wall temperature must be above the
liquidus yet low enough so that the vapor pressure of the condensate is small in com-
parison with the total pressure in the condenser. Salt of MSRE carrier composition
can be condensed in the temperature range 550 to 700°C; whereas, compositions

- containing greater than 90 mole % LiF require condenser temperatures of 800° to

900° C.

~ The dashed curves in the figure give the condensation rates for a vapor of MSRE
carrier composition and of pure LiF for values of the heat rejection rate. The
volumetric rate for the carrier salt was calculated for condensate at a reference
temperature of 600°C; for LiF the condensate temperature was taken as 875° C.

Thermal Design

 The governing requirement in determining the amount of heat that should be
supplied to the still and condenser is the time that can be tolerated in heating from
room temperature to operating temperature. Independent calculations were made for
the still section and condenser section for this transient period to find the relation
between time and installed heater capacity. This relation is shown on Fig. 11.  From
these data arbitrary choices of 15 kw for the still and 20 kw for the condenser were
made. These heat input rates will permit heating the unit to 1000°C in about 1.5 hr

~ if desired; however, a heat-up time of 2 to 4 hr will probably be employed. The

20-kw capacity on the condenser is adequate to allow using a thinner insulation than
the specified 4 in. if it is desirable to increase the distillation rate (see Figs. 9 and 10.)

~ In steady=state operation the heat demand by the still is only a small part of the
installed capacity. For example, the vaporization of 500 cm3/hr of MSRE carrier
salt requires about 1.5 kw, adding a calculated heat loss from the still of 1.1 kw,
there obtains a steady state requirement of 2.6 kw. Similarly for the condenser
liquefying MSRE salt at 700°C, the calculated heat loss to the surroundings is 2.1 kw.
Subtracting the latent heat of vaporization of the salt (1.5 kw) gives a steady-state

demand on the heaters of only 0.6 kw.

Heaters are arranged on the still so that about 11 kw are applied to the vertical
sides and 4 kw to the top. Separate controls are provided so that the top can be held
at a slightly higher temperature than the boiling salt to preclude condensation and
refluxing. The 20 kw on the condenser are divided into four approximately equal
parts covering the entire length. Each section has separate temperature control.

Cold Trap
The cold trap is inserted in the vacuum line upstream of the vacuum pump to
remove mists and vapors that could impair operation of the pump. The unit is shown
in Fig. 12. It is cooled by liquid N2 in the jacket surrounding the baffled vapor
chamber. Liquid No additions are made manually upon a signal from a level device
in the jacket. Nitrogen vapor is vented to the surroundings.
Vacuum Pump

The vacuum pump is a Cenco Hi-Vac capable of evacuating the system from

“atmospheric pressure to 0.5 mm Hg in about 3 hr. This time corresponds with the

out simultaneously.

Sampler

Nonradioactive Operation

The two photographs of Figs. 13 and 14 show the sampler. The unit is installed
directly above the sample cup at the condenser outlet (see Fig. 8). ~The small line
above the top valve is used to evacuate the chamber just prior to sampling; the
3/4-in.~diam by 1- 3/4-|n.-long capsule is then lowered by means of the crane into
the sample cup, filled with molten salt, and retracted to a position above the flange.
After freezing, the sample is removed for analysis by closing the lower valve and
opening the flange. The frequency of sampling is limited by the time required for
these operations. | '

This sampler was designed for use in molten salt test Ioop experiments and is’
being reactivated for this experiment.

Radioactive Operation

The same sampling device will be used to sample radioactive salt at the MSRE
site when irradiated fuel is distilled. The 1-1/2-in. pipe, through which the sample
capsule is lowered, will be lengthened to extend through the cell roof plugs, and
shielding will be installed around the valves and flange that are above the roof plugs.
A sample of condensate will be obtained as described above. The sample is then put
into a shielded container for transport to the hot analytical laboratory.

Heaters

Electric heating elements are used on all vessels and lines. For the vessels, the
heaters are fabricated of ceramic, refractory material in which the elements are
totally embedded. The heaters were molded by the manufacturer® to fit the geometry
of the vessels and to be removable without disturbing any nozzles or other connections

~ to the equipment. All ceramic heaters are capable of holding the vessel that they

surround at 1000° C,

A copy of the specifications to which the heaters were purchased is included in
Appendix G.

: -Thermul Insulation

Two types of thermal msulatlon are used. Adjacent to the heaters where the
temperature might be as high as 1200°C, a 2-in.~thick blanket of Fiberfrax* is used;
outside this layer, Careytemp 1600** is applied to the desired total thickness. The
Fiberfrax used here is Type 970-JH, having the cemposmon 50.9% AlyOg, 46.8%
S|O2, 1.2% B2QOg3, 0.8% Na20, and 0.3% inorganics by weight. H coni‘alns no
organic binders and is recommended for temperatures to 2300°F. Careytemp 1600 is
an expanded silica insulation reinforced with inorganic fibers and is recommended for
use to temperatures of 1600°F. Molded, segmented, cylindrical shapes are used to
cover the equpment. The outside surface is finished with asbestos cement and glass
cloth plus a bonding c:dhesrve to give a glazed appearance.

METALL_URGICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF HASTELLOY N

The metallurglcol propertiesSs 4 of Hastelloy N at elevated temperatures are well -
documentated in the temperature range 600 to 800° C where it is commonly used.
However, data in the neighborhood of 1000° C are nonexistent since there have been

“no previous occasions to consider the alloy for use at such a high temperature. . In

this experiment the still will be at about 1000° C during most of its operation, and the
upper porhon of the condenser.will be at 800° C or higher a large part of the time.
However, in light of the initial distillation work of Kelly 1 using small stills made of
Hastelloy N, this alloy appeared suitable for the engineering-scale unit. Furthermore,

- a time=consuming alloy developmental progrcm would have been. necessary to identify
‘@ more sunfcble material. ,

The results of an abbreviated testing program indicated that Hastelloy N should
be satisfactory for a short~term experiment and gave the data that were needed to
ensure a safe design. In addition, these tests revealed characteristics of Hastelloy N,
which, although not of serious consequence in this short experiment, would make this
~alloy unsuitable for use at 1000°C in a reactor processing plant. Three such properties
are the oxidation resistance, intergranular cracking, and the effect of thermal
cycling on high~ and low- temperature ductility.

Creep~Rupture Properties .

A brief, creep=rupture program? was undertaken by McCoy* to determine data
at 982°C (1800°F), and the results are given in Table 2, These data were obtained
on test specimens of a typical heat of air-melted Hastelloy N (Heat 5065). The
specimens were small rods having a gage section 1in. long by 0.125 in. diam.

The cumulative time that the vacuum still would be at 1000° C during the lifetime
of the experiment was estimated to be 1000 hr, and it was agreed that a satisfactory
design point would be one that limited the still to 1% creep over this length of time,

- The data of Table 2 were plotted as shown in Fig. 15 to extend the creep-rupture
‘characteristics over the expected lifetime. The curves show that the stresses producing
rupture and 5% creep over the 1000=hr period are reasonably well defined; whereas,
the 1% and 2% curves, in particular, are not defined sufficiently by the experimental
data. More data are needed for times greater than 100 hr. Nevertheless, the
allowable design stress was chosen by extrapolating the 1% curve to 1000 hr to obtain
a value of about 780 psi; this figure was rounded off on the lower side to 700 psi
which was used in the design calculations.

Ducﬁli.ty

* The ductility of Hastelloy N at 982°C (Fig. 16) exhibits a minimum for test
specimens having rupture lives in the approximate range of 50 to 200 hr, The
minimum ductility is slightly greater than 20%. The reduction in area decreases
rapidly with increasing rupture life to a value of about 15%. The increase in the
elongation for long rupture lives is thought to be associated with the exfenslve
lntergrcnular cracking that was observed.

 

*The data and discussion of this section are a summarization of the work of H. E. U
McCoy, Metals and Ceramics Division. His contribution to this design is gratefully
acknowledged. |

~ Metallographic Examination

“Metallographic examination revealed that the quantity of precipitate after test-
ing at 982°C and 2000 psi was much greater than that present before testing. The
tested material contained larger particles of precipitate, which are thought to be
induced by the thermal and mechanical history;  also the smaller precipitate in the
as-received metal appeared to be a different composition than that found in the tested
sample. The precipitate apparently does not impair the ductility at 982°C, but its
effect on low-temperature ductility was not established. This effect could be
important in a vessel that undergoes a number of thermal cycles.

STRESS ANALYSIS

This experiment requires the use of Hastelloy N considerably above its usual
upper temperature (600 to 700°C) in molten-salt service. To ensure the adequacy
of the design, a thorough stress analysis* was made using the data of McCoy discussed
in the preceding section. The principal concern was with the still=condenser unit
which experiences temperature as high as 1000° C in some areas. - For the feed tank
and condensate receiver, which are not expected to be above 600°C, the stress
analysis was confined to calculating the resistance of the flat heads to externdl
pressure for full vacuum operation.

Vacuum Still and Condenser

This analysis was based on the 1% creep property of 700 psi allowable stress at
1000° C and the rupture property of 1650 psi at this temperature (see Fig. 15). In
addition, it was assumed that the unit would undergo 50 to 100 thermal cycles during
its 1000-hr lifetime. The analysis considered the stresses induced on the walls, head,
and nozzle penetrations by full vacuum operation; the stresses imposed by the dead
weight of the system and the method of support; and thermal stresses due to heat flux
through the wall and expansion-contraction from thermal cycling.

‘The conclusions of this study are that:

1. the vessel be limited to a total 0percmng life of 1000 hr and to processing
npnradnoachve salts;

2. the vessel be observed after the nonradioactive experiments to determine
the effects of external oxidation and internal corrosion, and that the
effects be evaluated to determine if protective measures are required;

3. before use the vessel be given a thorough inspection (ultrasonic, dimen-
sional, photographic, visual, or other nondestructive tests) and that the
initial inspection be compared with a similar inspection after the non-
radioactive operation. |

An inspection of the still-condenser unit will be conducted before use and
compared with an inspection after the nonradioactive tests. This precaution is being
taken because of the lack of experience in using Hastelloy N at these elevated
temperatures, and, before use with radioactive salt, the integrity of the vessel must be
ensured. Even though conclusion 1 above states that the still not be used for distill-
ing radioactive salts, it was thought that this portion of the program was important and
should not be abandoned. Consequently, the vessel will be thoroughly inspected
aofter nonradioactive operation, and, if further integrity of the vessel is ensured,
radioactive operation will proceed as planned.

The ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Sections [l and VIII does not
include the operating conditions specified for this equipment; the analysis was made
on the basis of meeting the intent of the Code, specifically Section VII. The final
design meets the intent of the Code, and the calculated stresses are below the 700 psi
aliowable stress. No fatigue analysis of the vessel was made because the data for
such an analysis were not available. However, the vessel will undergo a number of
thermal cycles, and fatigue may be an important factor in the design. This useful
information will be obtained from the experiment.

Feed Tank and Condensate Receiver

Stress calculations for these vessels were made for the flat heads only since
these were the weakest areas of the two tanks. The feed tank is 15.5 in. OD by
16.5 in. high.,  The physical data of Appendix A, Table A-4, were used to confirm
the use of 3/8-in.~thick plate for these. heads in the 500 to 600°C temperature

range.
INSTRUMENTATION

- The vacuum distillation expenment is operated primarily from temperature and
pressure measurements; fo a lesser degree, level measurements are also used. There

are two distinct zones over which temperature must be measured and controlled:
a 500 to 600°C range for feed and condensate and an 800 to 1000° C range for the

 
 

 

 

 

40 | B - )
salt in the still. Pressure is controlled at about 0.5 qtm-in the feed tank and in the
- 0.3- to 1-mm-Hg range in the rest of the system.  Thermocouples are liberally

employed on vessel surfaces and internally to the vessels for monitoring all areas of
the equipment. Identifications and descriptions of all instruments are given in
Table 3. : | o

Temperature Measurement

For the high temperature part of the system (still and condenser) where exacf
temperature measurement is most important, platinum~rhodium thermocouples are used -
because of their high stability. Throughout the system standard Chromel-Alumel
thermocouples are used for signals to the temperature controllers in order to standard-
ize on readily available Chromel~Alumel controllers. For control in the high-
temperature zones, the control points will be changed to make the Chromel-Alumel
thermocouple agree with the Pt=Rh thermocouple in that zone if any temperature shift
is observed. The less expensive Chromel=Alumel thermocouples are the primary units
on the feed tank, condensate receiver, and salt lines; however two Pt=Rh thermo-
couples are installed on each tank to indicate any drift. All thermocouples are
enclosed in a 1/8-in.-diam Inconel sheath, and insulated junctions are used.

Most of the thermocouples are attached to the outer surface of the vessel or
pipe by inserting the junction into a tab welded to the vessel. Before installation
each thermocouple is tested to ensure that its function has not been impaired. In
- addition to the surface thermocouples, there is one thermowell in the feed tank, four
in the still, and three in the condensate receiver. These are made of 1/2-in.-OD
by 0.042-in.-wall Hastelloy N tube. There is also a thermowell drilled into the base
of the sample cup below the-condenser for monitoring condensate temperature, since
it is desirable to keep this temperature as low as practicable to avoid excessive salt
vapors leaving via receiver vent.

For readout there is one 24-point recorder for the Pt-Rh thermocouples and
one 24-point recorder for the Chromel-Alumel thermocouples.

The other required temperature indication is of the liquid N5 cold trap in the
condensate receiver off-gas line. There is also a liquid No pressure bulb in the
~ jacket of the cold trap to actuate an alarm at low Ny level. Upon manual addition of
liquid N2, a high=level signal from a similar bulb actuates another alarm. . A
Chromel-Alumel thermocouple is used as an alternative level indication at both points.

Temperature Control

There are nine individually heated zones on the feed tank, still, condenser, and o
receiver. Heaters on each of these zones are controlled separately by a Pyrovane =’

on-off controller. The voltage to heaters in each zone is controlled by Variacs.
There are seven heated lines on which heaters are controlled by on-off, manual
switches and Variacs. All heater controls are mounted on four 24-in. standard

_ instrument racks which adjoin two additional racks containing the temperature
recorders plus pressure and level instruments.

Tem peruture Annunciators

" Each of the nine heated zones on the equipment and the salt feed line to the
still are provided with low-temperature annunciators. The alarm-points are set to
provide indication of instrument or heater fcnlure before the temperature falls low
enough to freeze the salt.

Pressure Measurement

Feed Tank

An absolute pressure D/P cell connected to the feed tank vent line in the con-
tainment cubicle measures the pressure in the feed tank. This pressure will vary -
between 5 and 7 psia as the salt is pressurized into the still, the increase in pressure
being caused by the decreasing level in the feed tank. Pressure in excess of 7 psia
probably indicates a restriction in the still feed line.

Condensate Receiver

 

The pressure in the condensate receiveris used as an indication of the ‘pressure
in the still ofter adding the calculated AP through the condenser. Measurement of
the pressure in the still itself was felt to be impractical because of the high temper-
ature and because introduction of an inert purge into the still would make control of
vacuum more difficult. The pressure tap for this measurement is on the 1-in. vacuum
line very near the condensate receiver. Two pressure instruments are used: - (1) an
MKS Baratron pressure measuring device with ranges of 0 to .003, 0 to 0.01, O to 0.03,
0to 0.1, 0t0 0.3, 0 to 1, 0 to 3, and O to 10. mm Hg; and (2) anabsolufe
pressure D/P cell covering the range from 0 to 15 pan.

| Samele Line

A pressure transmitter measures the pressure between the two valves in the
1-1/2-in. salt sample line. During operation at vacuum these valves may not seal
tightly enough, and it may be necessary to maintain this pressure near the operating
pressure. '
 

 

49

Pressure Control

The system pressure is controlled by feeding argon to the inlet of the vacuum
pump. The Baratron pressure instrument is used to regulate the flow.

In order to protect the still against excessive internal pressure (at high temper-
ature, pressures in excess of 2 atm could be unsafe), the argon supply to the system
will be cut off if the system pressure exceeds 1 atm. The absolute pressure trans-
mitter in the condensate receiver off-gas line is used for this purpose.

Liquid Level Measurement and Control

Feed Tank

The pressure differential between the outlet of a dip tube extending to the
bottom of the tank and the gas space above the salt is used to measure the salt level.
Difference in level provides a check on the salt distillation rate. The dip~tube purge
is provided by the argon which displaces the salt being fed to the still. The feed
tank and condensate receiver liquid levels are transmitted to a two-pen recorder.

Still

A conductivity-type level probe (see Flg 17) is ‘used i in the shll for measuring
and controlling the liquid level. This probe is similar to the single=point level
probes being used in the MSRE drain tanks but with two concentric tubes instead of
one for the excitation length because of the limited head room in the still. Tests
have shown that a variable output is obtained over at least ane-third the length of

‘the sensing probe., A 6-in. sensing probe is therefore used to control the liquid

level between 1 in. and 3 in. below the top of the annulus. The bottom joint of the

“two concentric tubes in the excitation length is located at this upper control point.
~ When the salt is below this point, the control valve in the argon line to the feed tank

is open and argon flows through a capillary restrictor: to the feed tank. The restrictor
is sized so that the gas displaces salt to the still at a rate slightly in excess of the

~ desired distillation rate. A recorder shows the rising liquid level. When the bottom

joint of the excitation length is reached, the valve closes and the level falls for about -

- 2 hr until it reaches the bottom of the sensing probe. At this point a signal causes the

valve to open to start charging salt to the still again.

A second conductivity probe with a straight excitation length extends as close as

possible to the tapered bottom of the still pot ‘This provides salt level measurement

during the final boildown. .

Condensate Receiver

 

A third conductivity probe is installed in the condensate receiver to permit
following the distillation rate. -~ The probe is long enough to provide continuous
measurement for the entire volume of the tank. It was felt that the alternate choice
of a continuous bubbler-type instrument would require too much purge gas, causing
excessive pressure drop in the line to the vacoum pump. A bubbler-type instrument,
however, is installed for periodic checks and calibration of the conductivity probe.

- PREOPERATIONAL INSPECTION

The use of Hasrelloy N at temperafures of 800 to 'r000°C is not well enough
known to predict the condition of the vacuum distillation equipment after extended
periods of operation. Since the second phase of the experiment invoives the use of
radiocactive materials, it will be necessary to thoroughly inspect the vessel after non-

~ radioactive operation. The basis or reference for this inspection is a set of radio~
~ graphic observations plus direct and ultrdsonic dlmenslonal measurements made on the

assembled eqUtpmenl before initial operahon.

~-An inspection program was planned that completely described the still, condenser
and condensate receiver assembly. - As shown on drawings No. -M-12173-CD-019D,
M-12173-CD-020D, and M~=12173-CD-021D of Appendix H, a mapping of 247 points
for radiographic and ultrasonic measurements of wall thickness is specified on the
vessel surfaces. In addition, locations in the form of center-punched tabs are provided
for 55 length and diameter measurements. Data points are concentrated in regions
where highest material stresses are expected.

The referenced drawings contain a record of the initial measurements, showing
that thicknesses were measured to the nearest 0,001 in, and linear measurements to the
nearest 1/32 in. Because of equipment and geometrical limitations, it was not possible
to check every ultrasonic measurement with a direct measurement., Length and
diameter measurements were made after the unit had been installed in supporting
framework at the location where it was to be operafed Thls precauflon precluded a

_measuremenf blas due to handlmg and transport.

Afrer nonradloactwe operation, msulahon and heaters wull be removed and alI
measurements and observations will be repeated - The new data will be recorded on

~ the referenced drawing for easy comparison with initial values. At that time the

su:tabll:ty ol" fhe equnpmenr l"or furfher experlments will be decided,

 

*lnspechans and measurements were made by R. M. Fuller and co-workers of the
Inspection Engineering Division.

 
 

 

EQUIPMENT INSTALLATION

Unitized Construction

The entire dlshllahon unit conslstmg of the feed tank, still, condenser,

~ condensate receiver, and.cold trap with the associated heaters, insulation, and
thermocouples is installed in a 3 ft x 6 ft 4 in. x 8 fi - high angle-iron frame
~designed to be moved as a unit. The base supports for the feed tank and condensate
receiver are bolted to the botiom of the frame. . The still is supported by a counter’
weight on a pulley to allow for thermal expansion during Operaﬁon but will be
rngldly supported while in transit. The cold trap, being small, is supported by the
1-in. vent line from the condensate receiver. An electrical junction box and

two thermocouple junction boxes are provided on the frame.

| Hodd- Ihstal Iafiori

The distillation umt W||| be msl'alled ina wclk-ln hood, 4 ft 4 in. x 8t x 9 ft
high, located in Building 3541, for nonradioactive operation. The lZ-ft-Iong
instrument and heater control panel, the containment cubicle for D/P cells, remote.
valves, and the vacuum pump are mounted near the hood. The vacuum pump dis-

- 'chqrges through absolute filters. The directly operated sampler, described above,

 

is located inside the hood. Nonradioactive operation W||| test all of the equipment
to be used in the radioactive demonstration.

Cell Installation

At the completion of nonradioactive testing, the unit will be thoroughly in-
spected to determine its suitability for radicactive operat:on If this inspection is .
affirmative, all electrical, instrumentation, and piping connections will be broken
and the unit moved to Building 7503. . The unit will be installed in the spare cell
to the east of the fuel processing cell, as shown. in Figs. 18 and 19. Electrical and
thermocouple leads will be brought through penetrations in a roof plug to the high--
bay area over the cell where control panels are located. These panels contain
heater. controls, temperature recorders, and pressure and level readout msfruments.

| Salt is chorged. to the,feed tank through line No. 112, which is connected to .
~ the fuel storage tank and contains a freeze valve. All other piping connections
including the sample line passes through a roof plug to the high-bay area where the
sampler, vacuum pump, liquid Ny supply, and instrumentation are located.

Additional concrete shielding will be provided in the cell surrounding the unit
to prevent excessive radiation in the operating areas to the east and south of the cell. \/

Since the salt will have been fluorinated before distillation, no volatile activities
are expected to pass through the liquid No trap. The vent from this trap and the
three instrument lines for pressure measurements in the feed tank and receiver are -
routed to a sealed, monitored cubicle in the high-bay area. This cubicle contains
all equipment and instruments that are connected directly to the process equup-
ment (vacuum pump, control valves, and instrument transmitters) as shown in Fig. 20.
In case of activity backup in the lines, a radiation alarm will indicate the difficulty
and the lines or cubicle can be purged. The top and one side of the cubicle is
sealed with a gasketed, removable cover to facilitate maintenance.

FINAL DISPOSITION

At the end of the radioactive salt distillation, the salt will be distilled until the
level is just below the low-level probe. All heat will then be turned off the
equipment and the salt allowed to freeze.in the still and the receiver. The feed tank
will have been emptied as much as possible. The vacuum pump will be turned off and
the system allowed to reach atmospheric pressure and temperature under an argon
blanket. -

The level probe line to the receiver is heated and insulated and can be used
to remove a composite sample (or the entire amount of condensate). In that case a
shielded, sample-transport cask will be connected to the line in the high-bay area

and the salt pressunzed from the receiver. -

After the system is cool, all electricol and thermocouple leads will be severed
as close to the unit as possible. The flanged lines will be disconnected and blanked;
tubing lines will be cut and crimped.. The entire unit will be removed from the
cell using remote maintenance techniques and taken to a burial ground for storage.

APPENDIX C

Estimation of Pressure Drop for Salt Vapor
in the Still-Condenser System

The highest pressure in the still-condenser system during distillation is about
1 mm Hg which occurs just over the. surface of the liquid in the still. A vacuum
pump connected to the condensate receiver develops a lower pressure. in this
vessel to induce vapor flow through the condenser.. Because the ‘average pressure
in the condenser is low and the diameter is relatively large (9.25 in. D), the
possibility was foreseen that vapor could channel, resulting in incomplete conden-
sation. It was not desirable to make the condenser smaller in diameter because the
larger surface is needed for heat rejection; therefore, to avoid channeling, a core
" was placed in the condenser (Fig. C-1) to route vapor to the condenser wall,

The calculations that follow were made on the sysfem shown schematically in
Fig. C-1. They consider pressure drops for various flow rates beginning at the vapor
line opening in the still to the neck of the condensate receiver. The objective of
the calculations is to determine the annulus width that easily passes the amount of
vapor that can be condensed. In other words, the condenser-is to be made non-
channeling but with sufficient annular area that pressure drop is not the controlling
characteristic. The results indicate that a 3/4-in. annulus very nicely fulfills
these requurements, whereas a 1/2-|n. annulus l:mlts the distillation rate to about

500 em / hr.

The pressure drop is calculated in three steps: (1) the AP in the vapor line

from its entrance to the beginning of the core, (2) entrance loss into the annulus,

and (3) AP in the annulus. It was chosen to find the pressure drop for a conden-

sation rate of 800 ecm3 liquid per hour for a sample calculation.

denser design because this eliminates pressure drop as a factor in controlling
distillation rate.

APPENDIX D

Estimation of Time fo Heut'C_ondehsote' Receiver
and Feed Tank to Operating Temperature

5

The condensate receiver and feed tank are so nearly the same size and geometry
that one calculation of time~temperature characteristics is assumed to apply to both
vessels., The purpose of the calculation is to find the proper rating for heaters
attached to the outside of the vessel that permit heating from room temperature to
500°C in about 2 hr. The results of the calculation, presented above in Fig. 6,
page 17, show that a heat input of about 20 kw is required; the followmg discussion
illustrates the computahonal procedure.

Data and Computational Model

The condensate receiver, shown schematically in Fig. 7, page 18, ond detailed
in Dwg. M~12173=-CD~009 of Appendlx H, was chosen as the model for the calculation.
Elements of the model are shown in Fig, D-1. The vessel as installed is covered with
ceramic heaters that provide a uniform heat source to the vertical sides and bottom;
however, for calculational convenience it is assumed that all heat enters through the

~ vertical sides, the sides being made longer to include the heated area that would be

on the bottom. It is assumed that the vessel contains a full charge (48 liters) of salt
having the properties of MSRE Salt A (see Table B~2, Appendix B). This salt was
chosen because heat capacity and heat of fusion data are available and its composi-
tion very closely approximates that of MSRE carrier salt.

The energy received by the vessel wall is partially used to heat the metal and

Time to Heat Metal Wall to 600°C

Since the metal temperature rises much faster than the bulk or "mixed"
temperature of the salt, it is necessary during this transient period to limit the
metal temperature to some reasonable value, for example, 600 to 700°C, and
hold the temperature at this value until the salt melts and heats to operating
temperature, which is taken to be 500°C. While the metal is being heated, the
relationship between metal and bulk salt temperatures can be found from the
assumption used to get the proportionality factor of Eq. 3.

The value 6f C, (=0.495 Btu Ib=1 °F=1) ysed in Aqu 6isa wéighted specific
heat which inciudes in one number the effect of heating the solid, of the heat
of fusion, and of heating the liquid to 500°C.,

The left member of Eq. § contains the variables T and Ty, which are
related through Eq. 1 for any chosen heater capacity qy,; other quantities in
Eq. 1 are defined in Fig. D~1"and the paragraph titled Definitions. If we
choose a heater of 15 kw (51,195 Btu/hr) capacity and a surface temperature
for the insulation of 530°R, we obtain for Eq. 1:

(20) (0.1) (1.7) [Th - 530}

We need to use Eq. 8 to eliminate either Ty or T from Eq. 5 and then
integrate Eq. 5; however, the fourth-power relationship in Eq. 8 makes integration
of Eq. 5 difficult unless graphical methods are used. Equation 8 is plotted in
Fig. D-2; the "mixed" temperature of the salt, computed by Eq. 7, is shown on the
same plot. When values are substituted into Eq. 5, we obtain

= 18.5 minutes. This is the time for heating the vessel to 600°C (1571°R).
Dur:ng this transient period, the "mixed" temperature of the salt has risen only
about 5°R to 535°R (~25°CQ). '

Heating Salt to 500°C While Holding Vesse'lb.Walls at 600°C

 

Choosing at this point to hold the vessel walls at 600°C by on-off control
of the heaters, we examine the mechansim for transferring heat from the heaters
through the walls and then into the salt. The rate at which heat is recenved by
the wclls, assumed fo be by radiation only, is '
ok 10PA (74 -7 ) :

m h m

The rate of heat transfer into the salt depends upon convection which is

hoA (T - 1) .

These two expressions must be equal since the wall temperature is held constant.
Therefore,

A (T -T) = 0.173 x 1078 A e(T4-T4). - (10)
mlilm s m hm . A .

In Eq. 10, T_ increases with time, and the heat transfer rate into the salt

. :drops off because of the decreasing value of (Tm - T ) At the outset this

. temperature difference is large enough to permit all radlated energy to be
conducted into the salt. However, eventually (T = T) becomes small enough
that the heater outpyt must be curtailed (through the on=off control that holds
wall temperature constant). - During the time that the large value of (T - T) |
prevails, the energy balance is ,

The linear relation of Eq. 11 holds until the magnitude of (Tm - T)
decreases to the point at which convection transfer controls.. The salt temperafure
at which this oceurs is found by equating the radiation heat transfer rate to the
convection transfer rate as was done in Eq. 10, We define this temperature fo be

- The relationships between time and temperatures of the heater, vessel wall,
and salt were calculated from Egs. 8, 11, 12, and 16 and are plotted on Fig. D-3.
Two curves are presented for the salt temperature, one for the vessel wall at a
constant temperature of 600° C and a second for a constant temperafure of 700°C,
The difference in time between the two cases is insignificant.

‘were repeated for heating jackets of 10 kw and 20 kw capacity around the sides
and bottom of the condensate receiver.. These data, presented previously in
Fig. 6, page 17, were used to fix the heater capacity for the condensate receiver
 and feed tank. It was chosen to heat each tank with 20-kw heaters, having the ~
distribution over the vessel surfaces specified in Paragraphs 4.6.2 and 4.6.3 of
Appendix G. Since some heat is applied to upper surfaces that are not-contacted
by salt, the heater effectiveness for heating the salt is not the total 20 kw but
perhaps about 16 kw. The required time (Fig. 6) for brmgmg the vessels to

- temperature is then clbout 140 minutes.

~ Still and Condenser. — An analysis similar to that described in this
Appendix was made for the still and condenser, giving the time versus heater -
rating curves shown in Fig. 11, page 28 . A 20-kw heater was chosen for the
condenser and a 15~kw heater for the still giving a heat-up time of about 1.5 hr.

~ Calculations for the still-condenser system were straightforward since it was not nec-

essary to consider heating and melting a mass of salt. The small volume (12 liters) of
salt that might be in the still was included in the weight of the metal thus simplifying

the calculations. '

APPENDIX E -

Estimation of Heat Rejection Rate by Condenser

The condenser is designed to reject heat by conduction through the insulation and
convection to the' atmosphere. This characteristic was chosen for the design since it.
offers the simplest and most economical cooling method. . More efficient methods, such
as forced circulation of an inert gas or liquid metal, were evaluated and found to re-
quire a significant investment in circulating plus auxiliary heating and cooling equip-
ment. -

The following calculations illustrate the straightforward approach to finding the
heat rejection capability of the condenser. A 3-ft length was chosen for the calcu~-
lations since this was estimated to be the effective length of a unit that would fit the
available space; the actual condenser length of the completed design is 51 in.

- Independent variables in the condenser wall temperature and insulation thickness.
The object of the computations is to find the most suitable combination of these
variables for the desired distillation rate; results for condensing MSRE carrier salt and
pure LiF are presented in Fig. 10, page 26. For 4=in.~thick insulation and wall
temperatures between 600 and 850°C, the 3-ft length of 10~in.~OD condenser can
dissipate 5000 to 7000 Btu/hr; this is equivalent to condensing 500 to 600 cm3/hr of

-MSRE carrier salt. A 4~in. thickness is specified for the insulation on the installed
unit; this may be increased or decreased with little inconvenience if operating
experience does not agree closely enough with calculations.

Model for the Calculation

Heat given up by condensing salt inside the condenser must pass across an air gap
to the heater, through the heater, and then through the insulation to the surroundings
as diagrammed in Fig. E-1. The heater is used to heat the condenser from room
temperature to the desired condensation temperature. Once thermal equilibrium is
established, the heat of condensation maintains the unit on temperature, For this
calculation it is assumed that heat is radiated from the condenser to the heater and
then passes by conduction through the heater and surrounding insulation before being
dissipated to the atmosphere by convection and radiation.

Definitions .

In addition to the dimensions shown on Fig. E~1, the following terms are defined:

q = heat transfer rate, Btu/hr

| When thermal equilibrium is'establishqd; qy =qp = q3 = 9y and Eqgs. 5, 6,

this temperature is needed to find the radiation rate from the condenser. The

In Eq. 13 the desired quantity is qy, the heat that can be rejected by the condenser.
Therefore Eq. 13 can be used to eliminate Ty from Eq. 1 to obtain an expression in
which qy is the dependent variable. This gives

In this equation, Ty, the temperature of the condenser wall, is the independent

Presentation of Resulis

Equation 14 was used to calculate the rate of heat loss from the condenser for
several values of the wall temperature; these results are given in Fig. 10, page 26.
Insulation thickness, which affects the constants agg and agq, Was treated as a
parameter over the range 3 to 4 in. to completely cover the range of interest for
this experiment. The rate of condensation is greater at the higher condenser temp-
eratures because the larger temperature drop between condenser and surroundings
causes more heat to flow. On the other hand, a higher condensate temperature
implies a higher vapor pressure, which is undesirable from the viewpoint of salt
mist migrating into the vacuum system. | | |

Mechanical Features

(o) T'he'heahng elements shall be imbedded (totally enclosed) in a
thermally conductive refractory material. In general, the total
number of heaters should be kept as low as practicable.

(b) The heaters will be supported by and on the vessels by the Company (UCNC)
~and shall be of the .type that can be removed and replaced without
disturbing the vessel or any nozzles on the vessel. Direct access to
the vessels may be assumed for removal and replacement of heaters.
Heaters shall be designed for 1/4 + 1/8 in. clearance of vessel walls and
surfaces to allow space for thermocouple leads and to supply heat
uniformly over these surfaces within the limitations allowed by nozzles
and supports. |

(c) The vessels are equupped with various nozzles which will be maintained
at temperature as requured by heaters suppl ied by the Company

Heat Capacnty
Heat capacity of the heaters shall not be greater than 1 cal/g° C.
Electrical Accessories

The manufacturer is not required to furnish any power supply or control

""equipment. These will be furnished by the C{SmPC'"Y'

4.4

Thermal Insulation

. The manufacturer is not required to furnish thermal insulation.

4.5

'Elect_ricol Requirements

(@) Available power is 230 v, single-phase, 60-cycle alternating current.

- (b) . The manufacturer shall specify the power rating of each heater.

4.6 Geometrical Considerations

~ 4,6.1  Still and Considerations

4.6.2

4.6.3

(@) The markings on this drawing indicate the zonal heat requirements.
Total heat input to the still section is 15 kw; this rating may be
increased for manufacturing convenience by as much as 15% but
no decrease will be allowed. The top of the still shall have a
heat input of 4 kw; the remaining 11 kw shall be applied to the
sides. Heaters for the top section shall conform to the geometry of
the dome-shaped top. - When the still is operating at a temperature
of 1000°C the maximum loss rate to the surroundings of 1.5 kw may
be assumed. |

(b) Total heat input to the condenser section is 20 kw with a 15%
increase being allowed if needed for manufacturing convenience.
~ This total requirement is to be divided into three approximately
equal zones as shown on the drawing. When the condenser temp-
erature is 1000° C, the maximum heat reqmremenf including losses
to the surroundmgs wnll be '|0 kw.

Condensate Receiver, Drawing No. M=12173-CD-009-D.

This vessel will be heated along its bottom, vertical sides, and top.

A total heat input of 20 kw is required with a 15% overage being
allowed. The heat input is to be distributed over the vessel as follows:
approximately 30% on the bottom, 50% on the sides, and 20% on the
top. When the vessel is at a temperature of 1000°C, the maximum heat
requirement including losses to the surroundings will be 3 kw.

Feed Tank, Drawing No. M-12173-CD-013-D.

This vessel will be heated along its bottom, vertical sides, and top. A total
heat input of 20 kw is required with a 15% overage being allowed. The heat
input is to be distributed over the vessel as follows: approximately 30% on

~ the bottom, 50% on the sides, and 20% on the top. When the vessel is at a

temperature of 1000°C, the maximum heat requnrement including losses to the |
surroundings will be 3 kw. '

4.7 Special Features

(c) Terminal leads shall be at least 3 ft long and shall have a cross-sechonal

area more than twice that of the heater element and shall not be less than

No. 14 AWG.,
