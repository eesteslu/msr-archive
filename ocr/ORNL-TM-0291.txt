Homogenization of Molten-Salt Reactor Project Puel Samples
M. J. Gaitanis, C. E, Lamb, and L, T. Corbin

ABSTRACT

A copper pulverizer-mixer was designed for homogenizing
Molten-Salt Reactor Project (MSRP) fuel. The copper sampling
ladle that contains the solidified fuel is placed in the
pulverizer-mixer, which is agitated on a mixer mill., The fuel
is fractured out of the ladle, pulverized into a homogeneous
powder, and transferred to a storage bottle, The homogenized
fuel sample is then available for analysis.

INTRODUCTION

Molten-Salt Reactor Projeét (MSRP) fuel is a fused mixture of
LiF, BeFp, ZrFy, ThFYy, and UF4. The molten fuel is sampled with a
copper ladle in which it is allowed to solidify. It is necessary to
convert the solidified melt to a homogenous powder and to make avallable
the maximum amount of it for analysis.

A pulverizer-mixer was designed whereby the sample 1s removed from
the ladle, homogenized, and transferred to a storage bottle by means
of the agitating action of a mixer mill on which the pulverizer-
mixer is placed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE SAMPLE

The MSRP fuel is sampled by dipping a copper ladle into the molten-
salt stream, allowing the sample to solidify in the ladle, and transporting
the ladle-encased sample to a hot cell of the High-Radiation-Level
Analytical Facility. The ladle (Fig. 1) is 3/ in., 0.D. and 1 1/4 in,
long and that will contsin spproximately 10 g (4 ml) of sample., The
sample will solidify and will separate into more than one phase., The
phase separation necessitates that the sample be homogenized in order
to ensure representative analytical results.

DESIGN OF THE PULVERIZER-MIXER

A photogreph and & drawing of the pulverizer-mixer are shown in
Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. Because the sampling ladle is constructed
of copper, which does not interfere in the analyses, and because
contamination by another material is to be svoided, the pulverizer-
mlxer 1is also made of copper. The ladle, when placed in the pulverizer-
mixer, serves the same function as that of balls in a ball mill, The
shape of the pulverizer-mixer is designed to give maximum pulverizing
action on the salt by the ladle. The design of the metal-to-metal seal
at the inside center of the pulverizer-mixer prevents loss of sample
during the homogenization. The screw plug also makes a good seal
and provides an exit for the powdered salt when it is unscrewed. The
threads on the outside of the nipple ensble the polyethylene storage
bottle to be attached and retained in position during the transfer of
the sample to it. The pulverizer-mixer is agitated by a mixer mill
(Catalog Ttem No. 8000, Spex Industries, Inc., Scotch Plains, N. J.).
PROCEDURE

The empty pulverizer-mixer is located in the hot cell in the
arrangement shown in the horizontel center of Fig. 1. By means of
manipulators, the sample-filled ladle 1s placed in the pulverizer-mixer,
which is then assembled and placed on the mixer mill as shown on the right
in Fig. 3. The mixer mill is then activated for 12 to 15 minutes.

The pulverizer-mixer is removed from the mill, and the screw plug is
withdrawn from it. The polyethylene storage bottle is screwed

in place on the pulverizer-mixer as shown on the left of Fig. 3.

The assembly is returned to the mixer mill and positioned on it as
shown on the right in Fig, 4. The mixer mill is agitated for

5 minutes, during which time the homogenized sample is transferred

to the storage bottle. The pulverizer-mixer is unscrewed from the
storage bottle, and the screw plug and bottle cap are reattached to
the pulverizer-mixer and storage bottle, respectively, as shown in
Fig., 4 (lower left, top position). The completeness of removal of the
sample from the pulverizer-mixer and ladle is indicated by Fig. 4
(lower left, bottom position). The sample-free assembled pulverizer-mixer
and ladle are discarded to waste. The homogenized sample is then in a
condition that ensures the removal of representative test portions for
analysis.
