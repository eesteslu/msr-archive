SUMMARY

The enthalpies and heat capacities of seventeen fluoride mixtures in
the liquid state have been determined using Bunsen Ice Calorimeters and
copper block calorimeters. The fluoride mixtures were composed of the
fluorides of two or more of the following metals: lithium, sodium, potas-
sium, beryllium, zirconium, and uranium. The enthalpies and heat capacities
of most of these mixtures were studied in the solid state also. Estimates
of the heat of fusion have been made. Genersl empirical equations have
been developed which represent the enthalpies and heat capacities of the

fluoride mixtures in the liquid and in the solid state.

INTRODUCTION

For a number of years the enthalpies and heat capacities of various
fluoride mixtures have been determined by the ORNL Physical Properties
Group for the purpose of predicting the heat transfer characteristics of
these mixtures. This report is a compilation of the data previously re-
ported in the form of memorenda. Equations have been formulated so that
the enthalpy and heat capacity may be predicted from the composition.

In a sense this is a progress report since these properties are being

determined presently for other fluoride salt mixtures.
 

EXPERIMENTAL METHOD

Samples of the fluorides heated to constant and uniform temperatures
were dropped into calorimeters. The differences between the heat contents
of the samples at the furnace temperature and at the final temperature of
the calorimeter were measured by the calorimeters. The derivative of the

~enthalpy with respect to temperature yielded the heat capacity.

The design of the furnaces and of the Bunsen Ice Calorimeters has
been described previously (1,2). A full description of the Copper Block
Calorimeter will be given in a forthcoming ORNL report. During this in-
vestigation both apparatuses have been modified from time to time. The
brief descriptions which follow describe the apparatuses used at present.

The samples of the fluorides were contained in tapered metal cap-
sules, 2 1/2 inches long and 1 l/h inches average diameter. The capsules
were sealed by heliarc welding in an inert gas filled drybox to avoid
possible contamination with water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide.

Capsules containing the samples were heated in 6 inch long silver
liners centered in tube furnaces 2L" long. The temperatures of the
furnaces were measured by platinum - platinum-rhodium thermocouples lo-
cated in the silver liners and were held at the desired level by "Simply-
trol" controllers. After the capsules had reached the temperature of the

furnace, they were dropped into the calorimeters by electrically fusing

the short pieces of wire on which they were suspended in the furnaces.
This process of heating a sample and dropping it into the calorimeter will
subsequently be referred to by the descriptive work "drop".

In the Bunsen Ice Calorimeter the heat liberated by the ssample in cool-
ing from the temperature of the furnace to that of the calorimeter melted
some of the ice in an ice-water mixture. The change from ice to water was
accompanied by a volume change which was measured by a system of buretis
connected to the calorimeter. Each milliliter change was equivalent to
878.7 calories.

The total amount of heat measured by the ice calorimeters varied from
1,000 to over 30,000 calories. It was found that the precision of the
measurements was significantly less when large amounts of heat were liber-
ated. Although the ice calorimeter is in general a very precise device
(3,4), it is felt that when large amounts of heat are liberated, a non-
isothermal state can exist giving rise to poorer precision. A copper
block calorimeter was developed to remedy this difficulty; it was found
that this new calorimeter was characterized by far greater precision when
high quantities of heat were released than was the case for the ice calori-
meter. Two copper block calorimeters were placed into regular service,

which now yield data at a relatively high rate.
In the copper block calorimeter the heat liberated by the sample heated

8 large mass of copper. The temperature rise of the copper was measured by

 

an iron-constantan thermopile (12 junctions in the copper and 12 junctions
in an ice bath). The copper block was contained in a stainless.steel shell
which was submerged in a water bath. A potentiometer controller activated by
another thermopile maintained a zero temperature difference between the'ccpper
block and the water bath to minimize any heat exchange between the copper
block and its surroundings. The copper block was calibrated in terms of
calories per millivolt by meking "drops"” with aluminum oxide. The enthalpy
of aluminum oxide is well known (4). The precision of the calibration is
within + 0.5%.

The least squares method was used to determine an equation which repre-
sented the experimental data. The enthalpy determinations made using the
ice calorimeters exhibited enough scatter so that only a linear relationship
between the enthalpy and temperature was found to be significant; therefore,
the reported healt capacities were not temperature dependent. But the more
precise results obtained with the copper block calorimeter could be repre-
sented by a definite quadratic relationship. Thus the heat capacity was
temperature dependent.

The individual experimental enthalpy values that were obtained using a
copper block calorimeter for the drops of mixture No. 70 are listed in
Table 6 and are shown in Figure 1. The results are typical of those obtained

with the ORNL copper block calorimeter.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

The enthalpy and heat capacity equations obtained are listed in Table
2. The type of calorimeter used, the enthalpy and heat cepacity together
with the temperature range over which these properties were studied, and
the heat of fusion at the reported melting point (5)(6) are shown in this
table.

The enthalpies and heat capacities of a few salt mixtures have been
determined by other laboratories. A comparison between the results ob-
tained at ORNL and the outside laboratories are listed in Table 1. At
the National Bureau of Standards (7) the enthalpy of mixture No. 12 in
the liquid state between 454° and 900°C was found to be

Hp - Hyop = 15.0 + 0.4910T - 4.63 x 107272 cal./g.
and for mixture No. 40 in the liquid state between 520° and 900°C.
Hp - Hyog = 4.2 + 0.3137T ~ 3.765 x 107572 cal./g.
At the Naval Research Laboratory (8) the enthalpy of mixture No. 12
in the solid state between 30° and 455°C was found to be
Hp - Hzq0q = =799 + 0.264T + 7.25 x 10572 cal./g.
and in the liquid state between L550 and 900°C
Hp - HygOp = -32.98 + 0.7278T - 4.962 x 10741°
+ 0.381 x 10-613 - 1.199 x 10-10T4 cal./g.
In Table 1 7.99 cal. has been added to the enthalpies determined by the
Naval Research Lsboratory so that all enthalpies would have the same base

temperature of 0°C.

The comparison shown indicates that the enthalpies obtained at ORNL
with the ice calorimeter differ from those of the other lsboratories by a
maximum of 5%, and heat capacities differ by a maximum of 10%. Only one

comparison is availaeble for the ORNL copper block calorimeter. The enthal-

 

pies deviate with a maximum of 1%. At 70000 the heat capacity differed by
2%; at the extremes in the tempersture range studied (the melting point
and 900°C) the heat capacity difference was as great as 8%.

Most of the mixtures studied were near eutectic composition, and melt-
ing took place isothermally or over a very narrow temperature range. One
mixture, No. 82, melted over a wide range of temperature (nv5750 to BMSOG),
Figure 2. This was a zirconium fluoride base mixture. The enthalpy of
the liquid compared favorably with the enthalpies in the liquid state of
the other zirconium base mixtures (Table 4). This indicated that there was
a heat of fusion similar in value to the other mixtures which was absorbed
in the melting process. Mixture No. 21 did not exhibit an isothermal
melting. This mixture was not studied in detail below the reported melt-
ing point. The melting behavior is believed similar to No. 82. The enthalpy
of the liquid was similar to the values of the other zirconium fluoride
mixtures.

One mixture, No. 3, containing 60 M% Bng, exhibited a glass-like
behavior. The BeF, mixtures resembled those of heat capacities (slopes of
enthalpy temperature curves) of the alkali fluoride mixtures. However, the
enthalpy of No. 3 in the liquid state is much lower than the liquid enthal-
pies of the other mixes (Table 5). Presumsbly there is little, if any,

heat of fusion.

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS

It is of interest to find general relationships between the enthal-
Pies and heat capacities of the various fluorides. For most of the solid
elements the heat capacity at constant volume is equal to 3R or 6 cal./OC
per gram atom. The more modern theories of Einstein and Debye have the
same value as a limit which is reached st normal temperatures for most
elements (9). At constant pressure the heat capacities are found to be
greater, being about 6.4 cal./°C per gram atom (Dulong and Petit's law).
The Debye equation also predicts correctly the heat capacity of some com-
pounds, these being the compounds that crystallize in the cubic system.
The equation may be modified to predict compounds that do not crystallize
in the cubic lattice. In 1865 Kopp suggested that the molar heat capacity
of a compound is approximately equal to the sum of the atomic heat capac-
ities of 1its constituent elements.

In the case of liquid compounds which have no definite groups of
atoms or radicals, it has been found empirically that each gram atom con-
tributes approximately 8 cal./OC to the molar heat capacity of the com-
pound (10). In general if there are definite groupings of atoms (such as
in the Soha and OH ions), the average hest capacity will be less. In the
case of the hydroxides the average healt capacity in the liquid state is

7.0 cal./g. atom °C (2).
-]~

In order to find the contribution per gram atom the average molecular
weight and the average number of atoms per mixture are needed. The aver-
age molecular weight has been successfully used in correlating the densi-

ties of the liquid fluoride mixtures (11). The quantities are defined as

follows:
—=Z
M g xi Mi
¥ =%
N q xi Ni

where M = average molecular weight of mixture

N = average number of atoms per mixture
Mi = molecular weight of component

Ni = number of ions per component

x, = mole fraction of component

When the enthalpy of a mixture in units of calories per gram is multiplied
by ﬁ/ﬁ the product is the enthalpy per gram atom. The heat capacity per
gram atom may be found in the same way. Table 3 lists the heat cgpacities
per gram stom of all the mixtures investigated together with the values of
M, N, and M/N.

Figure 3 shows the relastionship between the heat capacity in gram units
in the liquid state and the factor M/N. In this figure with the logarithmic
scales the straight lines drawn represent the equation

The fluoride mixtures may be correlated best by dividing them into two
groups: +those that contain zirconium fluoride, and those that do not.
The latter will be referred to as the alkali fluoride mixtures.
Zirconium Fluoride Mixtures

The enthalpies in cal,/g. etom of the zirconium base mixtures afe
listed in Table 4. Most of the mixtures studied in this group consist of
sodium and zirconium fluorides with a little or no uranium fluoride. The
following equations were developed to represent these mixtures (Nos. 30,
31, k0, L4k, T0O).

In the solid

Ep - B0, = ~123 + 5.37T + 0.81 x 107977 (1)
C, = 5.3T + 1.62 x 10707

f

104 + 9.51T - 1.0 x 10~27° (2)

= 8.11 at 700°C
The enthalpies calculated by these equations are slso listed in Table k.
The enthalpies of Nos. 30, 31, 40, 4li, 70 are represented by these equa-
tions to within 2% and all the zirconium fluoride base materials to within
10%. The heat capacity of all zirconium fluoride base materials are repre-

sented to within 15% except for Mixture No. 33, with a heat capacity of
~15-

¥

10.9 cal./g. atom °C. The cause of the high heat capacity of this mixture
is unknown. Since the temperature range in which this mixture was studied
in the liquid state was small (6100 - 9%0°C) and therefore subject to more
error, it is planned to check the énthalpy of this mixture with the more
accurate copper block calorimeter.

The heat of fusion of these mixtures varied between 1570 to 2040
calories per gram atom‘with an average of 1810 cal.

Alkali Pluoride Mixtures

 

The enthalpies in cal./g. atom of the alkali fluoride base mixtures
are listed in Table 5, Most of mixtures studied consist of alkali fluorides
with uranium fluoride. Two mixtures contain beryllium fluoride. The follow-
ing equations represent all these mixtures. |

In the solid,

ET - _I_{25Oc = =340 + 6«76‘11 (3)
cP = 6,76
and in the liquid
Hy = Hyo0 =6Hy - 1610 + 9.47T (W)
C_ = 9.47

P

Because the heat of fusion varied grestly (from O to 1970 cal,/go atom) the
heat of fusion had to be included in the equation representing the liquid

to give a satisfactory correlation. The enthalpies calculated by these equa~
-16-

 

tions are also listed in Table 5. For the solid state the enthalples cal-
culeted by the equations from 20000 and higher agreed within 10% except
for Mixture No. 3 at 300°C. This is the mixture that indicated formation
of a glass and therefore would be expected to deviate from the others.

The heat capacities of the solid agreed within 6% of the equation. In the
liquid the enthalpies observed agreed within 5% and the heat capacities

within 16%.

 
-17-

FUTURE WORK

I. The ORNL Physical Properties Group has suggested that the presence
of complex compounds might increase the heat capacity of the liquid. If
these complex compounds should be decomposed between the melting point
and the upper temperature at which the liquid will be used, the heat re-
quired for decomposition weuld increase the heat capacity of the ligquid.
At present various mixtures in the sodium fluoride-zirconium fluoride
system are being meésured to determine the relationship between heat
capacity and composition. Complex compounds are known to exist in the

solid state in this system.

II. The heat capacity of mixture No. 33 which is at variance to the
other zirconium fluoride mixtures will be measured using the more accur-

ate copper block calorimeter.

I1I. As new mixtures are developed, their enthalpies and heat capacities
