The dynamic characteristics of the MSRE were
calculated for opervation with U and U fuels.
The analysis included calculation of the transient
response for reactivity perturbations, frequency
rvesponse for reactivity perturbations, stability,
and sensitivity to parvameter variations. The
calculations showed that the system dynamic be-
havior is satisfactory for both fuel loadings.

 

 

. INTRODUCTION

The dynamic characteristics of the Molten-Salt
Reactor Experiment (MSRE) were studied care-
fully prior to the initial U fuel loading in 1965
and again prior to the ***U fuel loading in 1968,
The first objective of these studies was to deter-
mine the safety and operability of the system. The
second objective was to establish methods of
analysis which can be used with confidence in
predicting the dynamic behavior of future, high-
performance molten-salt reactors. To satisfy the
second objective, it was necessary to include
theoretical predictions of quantities amenable to
experimental measurement. The frequency re-
sponse results proved most useful for this pur-
pose.

Several different types of calculations were
used in these studies. In general, they consisted
of calculations of transient response, frequency
response, stability, and parameter sensitivities.
Four considerations led to the decision to use
this many different types of analysis. These were:

1. It is helpful to display system dynamic
characteristics from different points of view as
an aid in understanding the underlying physical
causes for calculated behavior.

2. Computer costs for the different types of
analysis were small compared to the expense of
preparing the mathematical models.

3. The calculations for comparison with exper-
iment (frequency response) were essential, but
they did not furnish sufficient information about
the system.

4. The experience with a number of methods
provided insight on selecting methods which would
be most useful in analysis of future molten-salt
reactors. »

The analysis of the system with 233U fuel was
very similar to the analysis of the **°U-fueled
system. The modeling for the **°U study was
influenced slightly by results from dynamics
experiments on_the *%U-fueled system and the
analysis for the ***U-fueled system took advantage
of some new methods developed after the com-
pletion of the first study.

This paper describes the mathematical models
used, the computational methods used, and the
results of the calculations. A companion paper’
gives results of dynamics experiments and com-
parisons with theoretical predictions.

Il. DESCRIPTION OF THE MSRE

The MSRE is a graphite-moderated, circula-
ting-fuel reactor with fluoride salts of ura.niumé
lithium, beryllium, and zirconium as the fuel.
The basic flow diagram is shown in Fig. 1. The

Fig. 1. MSRE basic flow diagram,

molten, fuel-bearing salt enters the core matrix

at the bottom and passes up through the core in

channels machined out of 2-in. graphite blocks.

The 8 MW of heat generated in the fuel and trans-

ferred from the graph1te raises the fuel temper-
ature from 1170°F at the inlet to 1210°F at the
outlet. When the system operates at low power,
the flow rate is the same as at 8 MW, and the
temperature rise through the core decreases. The
high-temperature fuel salt travels to the primary
heat exchanger, where it transfers heat to a non-
fueled secondary salt before reentering the core.
The heated secondary salt travels to an air-cooled
radiator before returning to the prlmary heat
exchanger.

Criticality was first achieved with *°U fuel
(35 at.% 2°U) in June of 1965. After 9006 equiva-
lent full power hours of operation, this uranium
was removed and the reactor was refueled with
23317 (91.5 at.% 2**U) in October of 1968. Between
October 1968, and shutdown in December 1969,
an additional 4166 equivalent full power hours
were achieved with ***U fuel.

Dynamically, the two most important charac-
teristics of the MSRE are that the core is hetero-
geneous and that the fuel circulates. Since this
combination of important characteristics is un-
common, a detailed study of system dynamics and
stability was required. The fuel circulation acts
to reduce the effective delayed-neutron fraction,
to reduce the rate of fuel temperature change
during a power change, and to introduce delayed
fuel-temperature and neutron-production effects.
The heterogeneity introduces a delayed feedback
effect due to graphite temperature changes.

In some of the calculations (determination of

sary to eliminate the time delay from the pre-
cursor equation. This was accomplished by
eliminating the last two terms from Eq. (2) and
defining an effective 3; as follows: ~

Then, the approximate precursor equation is

This formulation assumes that the fraction of the
precursors which decay in in-core regions is
constant during a transient. Comparison of fre-
quency response calculations using this approach
and an approach which explicitly treats circulating
precursor effects showed negligible differences in
the frequency range of interest.

Since the neutron population is proportional to
fission power, the units on on were taken to be
megawatts.

B. Power

An attempt was made to include the effect of
delayed gamma rays on the total power generation
rate. If we assume that the delayed gamma rays
are emitted by a single nuclide, then the appro-
priate equation is

where

N = energy stored in gamma-ray emitters (in

v = fraction of power which is delayed
n = neutron population (in units of MW)

A =decay constant of gamma-ray emitter

The total power is given by
P=MN+(1-ym . (5)

For these studies the value used for A and v
were 0.0053 and 0.066/sec, respectively.

C. Core Heat Transfer

The core heat transfer was modeled using a
multinode approach. The reactor was subdivided
into sections and each section was modeled using
the representation shown in Fig. 2. This model
was preferred over a model with a single fuel
lump coupled to a single graphite lump because
of difficulties in defining appropriate average
temperatures and outlet temperatures for a single
fluid lump model.* If the outlet temperature of a
single fluid lump model is assumed to be the same
as the average temperature, then the steady-state
outlet temperature is too low. If the average
temperature is taken as a linear average of inlet
temperature and outlet temperature, then it is
possible for outlet temperature changes to have
the wrong sign shortly after an inlet temperature

change. The model using two fluid lumps circum-
vents these problems by providing an intermediate
temperature to serve as an average temperature
to use in the solid-to-liquid heat transfer cal-
culations. Also, the average temperature in the
second lump is a better representation of the
outlet temperature than the average temperature
of a single lump.

Since ~7% of the heat is generated in the gra-
phite by gamma ray and neutron interaction, the
graphite lump equation has an internal heat source
term. The equations are:

In most of the calculations, 9 sections of the
type shown in Fig. 2 were used giving a total of
27 lumps. The arrangement is shown in Fig. 3.
The fraction of the total power generated in each
lump was obtained from steady-state calculations
of the power distribution. The local temperature
coefficients were obtained for each region by
importance weighting the computed overall tem-
perature coefficients for fuel and for graphite.

In some of the calculations, it was assumed that
the heat capacity of the air in the radiator was
negligible. (Terms T2, and T2: are used for the

air side of the radiator.) Ignoring the heat storage

in the air leads to the following heat balance:
(WC)a1[T22 - T21 (in)] = (RA21 +hA2) Ty - T21) | (14)

E. Piping

Several models were used to represent salt
transport in the piping in different stages of the
studies. The simplest model was a pure time
delay. From some calculations (eigenvalues of the
systems matrix) it was necessary to eliminate the
delay terms. They were represented by Padé
approximations® in those calculations. In some of
the more detailed calculations, the heat transfer
to the pipe walls was included. Since experimental
results’ obtained after the ?*°U study indicated
significant mixing in headers and piping in the
fuel stream, some calculations for the **°U fueled
system used a model of a mixing chamber at the
core outlet. This model consisted of the following
equation (a first-order lag):

46T 1
S == (6T, - oT) . (17)

F. Values of Importa.nt Parameters

Some of the important parameters computed
for the ***U and ***U loadings appear in Table I.

G. Overall System Model

The models for the subsystems were combined
to give an overall system model. Several different
overall system models were used in different
stages of the study. The model shown in Fig. 6
was used in the study of the **U-fueled system.
This will be called the reference model. This
model resulted in a 44’th-order system matrix
with 4 time delays for heat convection and 6 time
delays for precursor circulation. Major modifi-
cations of this model which were used in some

aspects of the study are listed below:

1. The mixin§ pot was not included in the early
studies for the ***U-fueled systems. It was added
after experimental results' indicated significant
mixing of the fuel salt. '

2. For computing the eigenvalues of the sys-
tem matrix, each pure time delay for fluid trans-
port was replaced by a Padé approximation.
Effective delayed-neutron fractions were deter-
mined and Eq. (3) was used instead of Eq. (2).

3. In the models used in the MSFR code (see
Sec. IV), the heat exchanger and radiator models
were expanded. Instead of a single 5-node repre-
sentation for the heat exchanger, 10 sections (each
with 5 nodes) were used. Instead of a single 3-
node representation for the radiator, 10 sections
(each with 3 nodes) were used as with the heat
exchanger.

Calculations showed that results obtained with
the simpler heat exchanger and radiator models
gave good agreement with results obtained using
the larger models for these components.

IV. METHODS OF ANALYSIS
A. Transient Response

The transient response of the reactor system
was calculated for selected input disturbances

NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY VOL. 10 FEBRUARY 1971

(usually reactivity steps). The computer code
MATEXP® (a FORTRAN IV program for the IBM-
7090 or IBM-360) was used for these calculations.
MATEXP uses the matrix exponential technique
to solve the general matrix differential equation.
For the linear case, the general matrix differ-
ential equatien has the form:

= = Ax + f2) (18)
where

x = the solution vector

t = time |

A = system matrix (a constant square matrix
with real coefficients)

At) = forcing function vector.

The solution of Eq. (18) is

x = exp(Af)x (0) + f; explA(t - 7)] Alr)dT . (19)

MATEXP solves this equation using a power
series for the evaluation of exp(At):
exp(Af) =T + (Af) + 3(A8)* +. .. . (20)

In MATEXP, f(7) must be a step or representable
by a staircase approximation. For the nonlinear
case, the general matrix differential equation is

g;; Ax + AA(X)x +F() (21)

123

e e e -
Kerlin et al. @THEORETICAL DYNAMICS ANALYSIS

where

AA(x) = a matrix whose elements are changes
in the coefficients resulting from non-
linear effects.

The procedure used in MATEXP .to solve this
equation is to use an approximate forcing function
rather than to modify the A matrix continuously.
The procedure for proceeding from time-step j
to time-step j + 1 is

x(tj 1) = exp(at)e(t)) + [ 9 expla(t - 7)]
7
X {f(7) + AALx(7;)]x(7;)}dT . (22)

This result is analytically integrable and amen-
able to computer analysis. This method has
proved to be fast and reliable.

MATEXP uses a similar method for systems
with time delays.

B. Frequency Response

The frequency response for the ***U-fueled sys-
tem was calculated with a special-purpose digital
computer program, MSFR® (a FORTRAN IV pro-
gram for the IBM-7090 or IBM-360), and also
with a general purpose program, SFR-III' (a
FORTRAN IV program for the IBM-7090 or IBM-
360). The SFR-III program was used for the
analysis of the ***U-fueled system.

The basic approach in the MSFR program is
to program the transfer functions for all the sub-
systems and to connect them by the methods of
block diagram algebra to obtain the overall sys-
tem transfer function. This method proved to be
efficient (low computing time) and flexible (sub-
system models were changed readily by substi-
tuting different subroutines for the appropriate
part of the model). ‘

The SFR-III program uses a state-variable
approach to obtain the frequency response. The
system model is expressed in matrix form:

=Ax +d +gf(t) , (23)

S&

where
x = vector of system state variables

A = coefficient matrix (a constant, square ma-
trix)

d = vector of time delay terms (see below)

g = vector of constant coefficient of the forcing
function

f = the scalar fdrcing function.

124

The time delay vector allows any equation in the
set (row in the matrix differential equation) to
have terms containing the value of any state vari-
able evaluated at some prior time. Clearly, this
is needed to handle transport delays. The form
of this type of term is
7% &= Tii)
where

i = constant coefficient in row ¢ for the term
containing x; evaluated at a prior time
T = time delay for the effect of x; in row .

The Laplace transform of the time delay term is

L{ri]. 7 (¢ - 'ri].-)} = V% (s) exp(-7; s) . (24)

Thus, the Laplace transform of d in Eq. (23) is
L{d} = L(s, 7)%(s) , (25)

where

L(s,7) =a matrix whose elements are [;; =
7, exp(=T;; s)

x(s) = Laplace transform of x(2).

Equation (23) may be Laplace transformed to
give

sx(s) = Ax(s) + Lx(s) + gf(s) . (26)

Initial conditions are zero because the state vari-
ables represent deviations from equilibrium. The
transfer function is obtained from Eq. (26).

G(s) = x(s)=[sI-A-L]'Z. (27)

1
f(s)
The frequency response is obtained by evaluating
this equation for s =jw at selected angular fre-
quencies w.

The SFR-III program also furnishes sensitivity

to parameter changes. For instance, the fractional

change in G(jw) due to a fractional change in
coefficient, a;;, is
% 3G(jw)

This type of sensitivity coefficient is calculated
in SFR-III. The algorithm is obtained simply by
differentiating Eq. (27).

GUw) _ [sI -A - L] ' G(jw) . (28)

aa,-,-

It is noteworthy that the factors on the right side
of the sensitivity equation are evaluated in the
normal frequency response calculation. Thus, the
sensitivities are obtained only at the expense of a
matrix multiplication of known quantities.

NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY VOL. 10 FEBRUARY 1971
C. Stability Analysis

Three different methods were used for ana-
lyzing the linear stability of the system. These
were analysis by the Nyquist method, calculation
of the eigenvalues of the system matrix, and
analysis by the modified Mikhailov method.

1. The Nyquist Method—The stability analysis
by the Nyquist method followed standard practice.’
The MSFR code (see Sec. IV) was used to com-
pute open loop frequency responses. The Nyquist
criterion requirement for stability is that the net
number of encirclements of the (-1,j0) point for
- o < @ < © must be equal to the number of right
half-plane poles of the open loop transfer function.
Thus, it is necessary to know the stability char-
acteristics of the open loop system prior to
analysis of the closed loop system. In the MSRE
analysis, it was assumed that the open loop trans-
fer function had no right half-plane poles. This
was verified in other analyses.

2. Eigenvalue Calculation—The eigenvalues of
the A matrix (numerically identical with the poles
of the closed loop transfer function) must have
negative real parts if the system is stable. Eigen-
values were computed using a computer code
based on the QR transform method.’

3. Modified Mikhailov Method—A new method
was developed'® for stability analysis of large
state-variable system models (pure time delays
in the model are allowed). The criterion is that
a plot of the function M(jw) for - ©* < w < must
have no net encirclements of the origin for M(jw)
given by

det (jwI-A - L)

 

M(jw) = (29)

n .
I (jw + la;; )
1=t

D. Stability Range Analysis

After the analysis of the **°U-fueled MSRE
using design parameters indicated that the system
was stable, a systematic study of the influence of
parameter uncertainties was made. The maximum
expected range on the value on each important
system parameter was estimated. Then, an auto-
matic optimization procedure'’ was used to find
the combination of parameters in this region of
parameter space which gave the least stable sys-
tem. A simplified system model was used for this
study (only one graphite node and two fuel nodes
to represent the core). These calculations gave
combinations of system parameters which result
in the least stable configurations. The parameters
NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY

VOL. 10 FEBRUARY 1971

Kerlin et al. THEORETICAL DYNAMICS ANALYSIS
corresponding to this least stable configuration
were then used in a stability analysis using the
more detailed model. This analysis indicated that
the system is stable for any combination of sys-
tem parameters within the predicted uncertainty
range.

V. RESULTS

The methods described in Sec. IV were used
with the models described in Sec. III to analyze
the dynamics of the MSRE. Results for the **U-
fueled system are given first, followed by results
for the ***U-fueled system. Also, a comparison of
system performance with 235 fuel and with **°U
fuel may be obtained by comparison of results
from similar calculations for the two systems.

A. 25U-Fueled System3

1. Transient Response—The MATEXP code was
used with the state variable model to compute the
response of the uncontrolled MSRE to a step input
in reactivity. The results for a step input of
0.01% dp for low power operation and for high
power operation appear in Fig. 7. At low power,
the response is a low frequency, lightly damped
return to equilibrium. At high power the response
is a higher frequency, more strongly damped
return to equilibrium.

2. Frequency Response—The results of a set of
frequency response calculations using the MSFR
code (see Sec. IVB) appear in Fig. 8. The results
indicate fairly sharp peaks in the amplitude at low
frequency for low power operation, and broader
peaks at higher frequencies for higher power
operation. This behavior is consistent with the
transient response results. In general, the fre-
quency response plots are rather featureless and
indicate no dynamics problems for the system.

The results of the frequency response analysis
and the transient response analysis indicate that
the natural period of oscillation of the perturbed
reactor is a strong function of the operating
power level. This natural period may be obtained
directly from the transient response results or
from the location of the dominant amplitude peak
in the frequency response results. The dependence
of natural period of oscillation on power level
appears in Fig. 9.

2. Stability—TFor the ***U-fueled system, the orig-
inal stability analysis was based on a Nyquist
analysis and an eigenvalue calculation. The Ny-
quist plot appears in Fig. 10 for low power oper-
ation and for high power operation. The locus is

frequency, more strongly damped behavior at
higher power. Also, stable system operation is
indicated at all power levels with relative sta-
bility increasing as the power level increases.

B. 233U-Fueled System

1. Transient Response—The MATEXP code was
used with the state variable model to compute the
response of the uncontrolled, ***U-fueled MSRE"
to a step input in reactivity. The results for a
step input of 0.01% 6p are shown in Fig. 7.

Other transients which were calculated for the
U-fueled system appear in Fig. 12. At the
higher power levels the power rises sharply after
a step increase in reactivity, but the temperature
effects in the core promptly counterbalance the
reactivity input, and the power decreases toward
its initial level. However, before returning to its
initial level, the power levels out on a transient
plateau. It stays at this level until ~17 sec after
the reactivity perturbation; then it again begins
to decrease. The power plateau is observed
because a quasi-steady state exists in the core

region. The inlet temperature is the same as it
was before the perturbation, and the core nuclear
average temperature has increased enough to
compensate for the reactivity change. After ~17
sec (the transit time of the fuel in the external
loop) the return of higher-temperature salt in-
creases the inlet temperature and introduces
negative reactivity through the negative temper-
ature coefficient. After sufficient time the reactor
returns to the initial power level, at which time
the net increase in average temperature compen-
sates for the step reactivity input. This behavior
was not observed in the ***U-fueled system for
the power levels considered.

A comparison of the step response of the sys-
tem for the complete, nonlinear model and for a
linearized model was made. The results appear
in Fig. 13. It is observed that the nonlinear effects
are more important at low power where larger
fractional power changes can occur before the
inherent temperature feedback can cancel the
inserted reactivity.

2. Frequency Response—The results of a set of
frequency response calculations using SFR-III
appear in Fig. 14. The results are similar to the
results for the **°U-fueled system. In general,
the dominant amplitude peaks for the *3yu-tueled
system are lower, broader, and at slightly higher
frequencies than for the **U-fueled system. This
is mainly due to the greater negative temperature
feedback in the ***U-fueled system resulting from
the greater magnitude of the negative fuel temper-
ature coefficient of reactivity which overrides the
destabilizing effect of the lower delayed-neutron
fraction. As with the **°U-fueled system, the fre-
quency response results indicate a well-behaved
system.

The dip in the frequency-response amplitude
at 0.24 rad/sec is due to the fuel recirculation
effect. The total loop time is 16.73 + 8.46 = 25.19
sec (see Table I). The frequency associated with
this is 6.28/25.19 = 0.24 rad/sec. Experiments
with the **°U fueled system® indicated that the dip
was much smaller than predicted by a model
which used pure time delays for fuel transport.
Consequently, a first-order lag representation of
a mixing pot was added to the model. Calculations
were made to determine the effect of assigning
different fractions of the external loop time to the
mixing pot holdup time. These results appear in
Fig. 15 for operation at 8 MW.

The sensitivity of the frequency response to
parameter changes was also calculated using
SFR-III. Some results are shown in Fig. 16 for
operation at 8 MW. These clearly show the fre-
quency range over which the parameters have
an important effect on system dynamics. For

example, the large changes in the mixing pot
holdup time and the heat exchanger characteris-
tics at ~0.24 rad/sec suggest that fuel salt
recirculation effects are important factors in
determining the amplitude dip at 0.24 rad/sec.

3. Stability—For the **U-fueled system, the sta-
bility analysis was based on an eigenvalue cal-
culation and a modified Mikhailov analysis. The
eigenvalues appear in Fig. 17. All of the eigen-
values have negative real parts and the real part
of the dominant eigenvalue becomes more negative
as the operating power level increases. The
results of the modified Mikhailov analysis appear

in Fig. 18. (These curves only show the range

0 <w <, The locus for - <w < 0 is simply
the mirror image around the real axis.) No
encirclements of the origin were observed for any
power level, indicating stable system operation
at all operating power levels.

Vi. CONCLUSIONS

A detailed analysis of the dynamics and sta-
bility indicates that the system is stable and
operable at all power levels. Furthermore, rela-
tive stability increases as the operating power
level increases. The smaller delayed-neutron

dynamics or stability problems. This is because
the stabilizing effect of a more negative fuel
temperature coefficient of reactivity in the **U-
fueled case compensates for the effect of a
smaller delayed-neutron fraction.

Numerous analytical methods were used in the
studies. Experience showed that the effort re-
quired to implement the different methods was
justified by the increased understanding of system
characteristics made possible by interpretation of
the various results. It is felt that, in general, a
