FOREWORD

This quarterly progress report of the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Project at ORNL records the
technical progress of the research on Circulating-Fuel Reactors and all other ANP research at
the Laboratory under its Contract W-7405-eng-26. The report is divided into three major parts: |.
Reacter Theory, Componenf Design and Testing, and Construction, Il. Materials Research, and
[l. Shielding Research.

The ANP Project is comprised of about 300 technical and scientific personnel engaged in
many phases of research directed toward the achievement of nuclear propulsion of aircraft. A
considerable portion of this research is performed in support of the work of other organizations
participating in the nafionf:l ANP effort. However, the bulk of the ANP research at ORNL is
directed toward the development of a circulating-fuei type of reactor.

The effort on circulating-fuel reactors was, until recently, centered upon the Aircraft Reactor
Experiment. The equipment for this reactor experiment has been assembled, and the current
status of the experiment is summarized in Section 1 of Part |.

The design, construction, and operation of the Circulating-Fuel Reactor Experiment (CFRE),
with the cooperation of the Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Division, are now the specific long-range
objectives. The CFRE is to be a power plant system that will include a 60-Mw circulating-fuel
reflector-moderated reactor and an adequate heat disposal system. Operation of the system will

be for the purpose of determining the feasibility and the problems associated with the design,

construction, and operation of a high-powered reflector-moderated aircraft reactor system. The

design work, as well as the supporting research on materials and problems peculiar to the CFRE

(previously included in the subject sections), is now reported as a subsection of Section 2,

¥

““Circulating-Fuel Reflector-Moderated Reactor.’

The ANP research, in addition to that for the Circulating-Fuel Reactor Experiment, folls

into three general categories: studies of aircraft-size circulating-fuel reactors, materials problems

associated with advanced reactor designs, and studies of shields for nuclear aircraft. These"

phases of research are covered in Parts |, H, and lll, respectively, of this report.

SUMMARY

PART |. REACTOR THEORY, COMPONENT
DESIGN AND TESTING, AND CONSTRUCTION

Circulating-Fuel Aircratt Resctor Experiment

The water tests of the fuel and the sodium cir-
cuits of the ARE system at room temperature were
completed (Sec. 1). The sodium circuit was pres-
sure-filled with water from the sodium fill tanks,
while the fuel system was vacuum-filled to ensure
the elimination of gas pockets in the fuel system.
Both systems were found to function properly, and
the filling, circulating, and draining operations
were effected with a minimum of difficulty. After
the water was drained, the system was dried by
heating it to approximately 600°F. The electrical
heating system was found to be satisfactory in
the check thus afforded.

The final system completion work is now under
way, that is, removal of the sodium system reactor
bypass, completion of the fuel-enrichment system
installation, completion of thermocouple and insu-
iation installation, and other minor modifications.
When this work is completed,
charged to the system and the high-temperature
checkout phase of the experiment will be initiated.

The neutron source was put into the reactor, and
the nuclear checked out.
Also, mechanical checks were made of the per-
formance of the safety and control rods. The
building electric and helium systems were made
ready to accommodate the loading facilities, and
final arrongements were completed for attaching
the fuel-sampling equipment.

Radiation damage experiments indicated the de-
sirability of providing gamma shielding at several
points where elastomers were used (belts, dia-
phragms, etc.}. Where shielding was impractical,
the composition diaphragms were replaced with

The results of operation of the reactor system
component test loop at K-25 are encouraging in
that the loop has now been operated without major
difficulties for more than 1800 hr. None of the
minor difficulties encountered would indicate that
serious problems might arise in operation of the

ARE.

Reflector-Moderoted Reactor

The program for the development and construc-
tien of the Circulating-Fuel Reactor Experiment
(CFRE) has been outlined, .and many of the de-
velopment projects are under way. Tentative
design data have been compiled and o flow sheet
has been prepared (Sec. 2). The first priority
development project, the test of beryllium in con-
tact with sodium and Inconel under thermal stress,
has been completed. The results of this test were
needed in the determination of the dmcunf of
poison to be expected in the reflecter. The test
indicated that beryllium will not crack under the
thermal stresses involved in the temperature range
1000 to 1300°F. Since corrosion and mass transfer,
as well as thermal stress, will be important in the
beryllium-lnconei-sodium system, many static and
dynamic tests under varieus conditions have been
made. There is considerable evidence to indicate
satisfactory compatibility in the beryllium-Inconel-
sodium system at temperatures up to 1200°F.

The temperature coefficient of reactivity for the
CFRE was computed on the UNIVAC and, for rapid

- temperature changes, was found to be -3.5 x

10-°/°F. The critical mass computed for the
rhombicuboctahedral critical assembly was rede-
termined because of errors found in the originaol
data. The redetermined value agreed closely with
the experimental value, but, since the criticol
mass is not very sensitive to errors in detail,
further evaluation of the agreement must await
additional experimental results,

Experimental Reactor Engineering

The emphasis in the engineering work is now
on development of components for an in-pile loop
for insertion in a horizontal beam hole of the MTR
and the design ond construction of forced-circu-
lation corrosion testing loops (Sec. 3). The in-pile
loop for insertion in the MTR is o joint ORNL and
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Division project. It is
to circulate proposed fuel mixtures in the high-flux
of the MTR so that the extent of radiation damage
to materials of construction and the effect of radi-
ation on the fuel can be determined. Two types
of pumps have been developed for in-pile use: a

L |
ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

vertical-shaft centrifugal sump pump for instal-
lation external to the reactor shield and o hori-
zontal-shaft sump pump for insertion inside a beam
hole. A turbine-type impeller is being considered
for the horizontal-shaft pump because it would
have the advantage that both the inlet and dis-
charge could be at the bottom. Hydraulic motors
of suitably small dimensions have been found to
be satisfactory drives for these pumps.

Two series of Inconel forced-circulation cor-
rosion loops for circulating fluoride mixtures are
being developed to meet the following require-
ments: (1) a Reynolds number of 10,000 with
temperature gradients of 100, 200, and 300°F and
(2) a temperature gradient of 200°F with Reynolds
numbers of 800, 3,000, and 15,000. The maximum
fluid temperature is to be 1500°F,

A study is under way of the cavitation phe-
nomenon associated with operating liquid metal
systems at elevated temperatures, high flow rates,
and high pump speeds. A correlation of fluid-flow-
noise infensity with pressure data was noted.

The number of stations available for convection-
loop testing was increased from 18 to 31 and the
basic design of the loops was simplified. Various
means of heating the loops and of making operation
of them more automatic are being studied.

Critical Experiments

The first step of the present critical experiment
program was the construction of a small two-region
reflector-moderated reactor to provide experimental
data on a system of simple geometry and materials
for use in checking the calculational methods
being used (Sec. 4). The core consists of alter-
nate sheets of enriched uranium metal and Teflon
and is surrounded by a beryllium reflector. The
uranium loading can be varied, within the specified
dimensions, to make the system critical. The
assembly was looded as prescribed by the multi-
group calculations but was not critical. However,
when the calculations had been corrected to take
into account errors in the original data, a new
attempt to achieve criticality with the prescribed
loading was made. The corrected prescribed
loading was 20.9 to 22.75 |b of U??® and the
experimental loading was 24.35 1b of U235, A
larger critical assembly of the same shape is to
be constructed that will consist of three regions,
with the beryllium island and the reflector sepa-
rated by the fuel annulus. A further check on the
calculational methods will be obtained.

PART H. MATERIALS RESEARCH
Chemistry of Molten Materials

Studies of the fluoride systems of interest as
reactor fuels were continued, with particular em-
being given to systems in which the
uranium-bearing component is the less corrosive
UF, or a mixture of UF, and UF, rather than UF,
alone (Sec. 5). Recent attempts to correlate the
anticipated reduction of UF, in the UF -bearing
melts with wet chemical analysis for UF, and
UF, and results of petrographic examination show
some surprising anomalies. When UF, dissolved
in LiF, in NaF--ZrF4-UF4 mixtures, or in NaF-LiF
mixtures is treated under flowing hydrogen at
800°C with excess uranium metal, 90% or more
of the UF, is reduced to UF,. However, when
this technique is applied to UF, in NaF-KF-LiF
mixtures, the reduction is only 50% complete at
800°C and, perhaps, 75% complete at 600°C.
Petragraphic examinations of the specimens reveal
no complex compounds of tetravalent uranium; it
is possible that the UF, is “hidden’” in solid
solutions or in complex UF4-UF3 compounds in
which it is not at present recognizable.

Solid phase studies of the NaF-ZrF -UF, system
were initiated following completion of studies of
the NaF-ZrF, system, and to date no ternary com-
pounds have been discovered. A tentative equi-
librium diagram was prepared.

phasis

A methed for large-scale purification of rubidium
fluoride has been developed that can be used if
material sufficiently free from cesium cannot be
obtained from commercial sources. Fundamental
studies of the reduction of NiFF, and FeF, by H,
in NaF-ZrF, systems were made as a means of
determining possible improvements in purification
techniques. Also, methods for preparing simple
structural metal fluorides were studied.

Large quantities of puritied ZrF ,-base fluorides
were prepared for engineering tests at ORNL and
elsewhere, and the demand for purified fluorides
of other types is rapidly increasing. Therefore
preparation and purification methods have been
studied intensively in an effort to lower production
time and costs. Developments indicate that the

price of purified NaZrF, and NoF-ZrF ,-UF, mix-

tures may be halved in the next few months.

Corrosion Research

The static and seesaw corrosion testing fa-
cilities were used for further studies of brazing

-
o
alloys, special Stellite heats, Hastelloy R, In-
conel, graphite, and various ceramics in sodlum
flucride fuel mixtures, and other mediums (Sec. 6).
The brazing alloy 67% Ni-13% Ge~11% Cr-6%
Si—-2% Fe~1% Mn was found to have good corrosion
resistance in fluoride fuels and fair corrosion
resistance in sodium and therefore will be useful
for the fabrication of many reactor components.

In the thermal-convection loop studies, UF,-
bearing fuels were tested in Inconel. Hot-leg
attack is not found in Inconel loops in which ZrF -
base fluoride mixtures with the uranium as UF,
are circulated. A deposit is, however, found on
the hot-leg surface. Only preliminary information
is available, but it appears that neither attack
nor a hot-leg layer is found with alkali-metal-base
fluoride mixtures containing UF,. Mixtures of
UF, and UF, result in a reduction in attack from
that found with only UF,, but some attack is
present, and in high-uranium-content systems the
attack may be significant,

Several Hastelloy B loops have now been suc-
cessfully operated in both the as-received and the
over-aged conditions. In both coses @ consider-
able increase in hardness occurs during operation.
With ZrF, -base mixtures containing UF,, very
little attack is found, even after 1000 hr.

Thermal-convection loop tests of molten lithium
in type 316 stainless steel were operated for 1000
hr. There were no signs of plug formation, and
only a small amount of mass transferred material
was found in one loop. Alloys of 45% Cr—55% Co,
Ni-Mo alloys, and the Fe-Cr-base stainless steels
have been shown to be more resistant to corrosion
and mass transfer in liquid lead than are the pure
metals. Their resistance to mass transfer can
probobly be related to the formation of interme-
tallic compounds. |

Metallurgy

Creep and stress-rupture testing by the tube-
burst method has been studied intensively (Sec. 7).
In the tube-burst tests, a tube that is closed at
cne end is stressed with an internal gas pressure.
The stress pattern introduced into the specimen
in this fest approaches the stress pattern that will
be found in ANP-type reactors. Apparatus for the
tests has been constructed, and a theoretical
analysis has been made with which o check en the
experimental results can be obtained.

In the investigation of high fhermql-conductwlty

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1954

fins for sodium-to-air radiators, stress-rupture and
creep tests were made on copper fins with various
types of cladding at stress levels between 500 and
2000 psi at 1500°F. The tests show that for o
1000-hr exposure in air, stresses greater than 500
psi and less than 1000 psi are tolerable; that s,
in this stress range there is no indication of
brittleness in the core or oxidation of the core
due to cladding failure of type-310 stainless-steel-
clad copper fins. From the over-all considerations
of melting point, oxidation resistance, dilution of
fin and tube wall, formation of low-melting eu-
tectics, and flowability, it was found that Coast
Metals alloy 52 was the best brazing alley for
use in the construction of radiators with high-
conductivity fins. A sodium-to-air radiator with
6 in. of type-430 stainless-steel-clad copper high-
conductivity fins was fabricated by use of a combi-
nation heliarc welding and brazing procedure.

Packed-rod nozzle assemblies were fabricated
for the 100-kw gas-fired liquid-metal-heater system,
and work was started on the formation of duplex
tubing. An attempt is being made to prepare tubing
that will have good corrosion resistance on the
inner surface and oxidation resistance on the outer
surface.

Attempts are being made to find new alloys in
the nickel-molybdenum system that will have better
high-temperature strength and fluoride corrosion
resistance than Inconel has. Hastelloy B satisfies
these requirements, but it has poor fabrication
properties and oxidation resistance; it also loses
its ductility in the temperature range of interest
for application in high-temperature circulating-fuel
reactors. lInvestigations are under way to find a
suitable melting practice and heating treatment
that will increase the ductility of Hastelloy B in
the temperature range of interest.

Heot Transfer and Physical Properties

The enthalpies and heat capacities of NaF-ZrF -
UFJ (65-15-20 mole %) and of LEF-N0F~UF4 (57.6-
38.4-4.0 mole %) were determined (Sec. 8), The
thermal conductivity of NaF-KF-UF, (46.5-26.0-
27.5 mole %) was found to be 0.7 Btu/hr-f’rz(ol:/ff)
that for KF-LiF-NaF-UF , (43.5-44.5-10.9-1.1 mole
%) was 2.0, and that for LiF-KF—UFd (48.0-48.0-
4.0 mole %) was 1.4. A new electrical conduc-
tivity device has been constructed and has been
successfully checked with molten salts of known
conductivity.
ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

A device for studying the rates of growth of
tube-wall deposits has been successfully tested
with a simple heat transfer salt. Also, a hydro-
dynamic flow system for studying the reflector-
moderated reactor flow structure has been tested.
A mathematical study of the temperature siructure
in converging and in diverging channel systems
that duct fluids with volumetric heat sources and
a study of wall cooling reguirements in circulating-
fuel reactors were made.

Rudiation Damoge

Additional irradiations of Inconel capsuies con-
taining fluoride mixtures were carried out in the
MTR (Sec. 9).
UF,-bearing fue! has been examined, and it shows
no corrosion, in confrast to that found previously
with UF  -bearing fuels.

Inspection of the LITR in-pile loop, which failed
prior to startup, disclosed that the failure was
caused by ¢ bregk in the weld connecting the pump
discharge nipple to thz fuel line. Design revisions
and refabrication of some of the parts are in prog-
ress. Developmental work continued on a smaller

vestigations are being made of the oxidation of
Ut', and of UF, with oxygen at slevated tempera-
tures,

An improved method for the determination of
lithium in NaF-KF-LiF-base fuels was developed.
Also, studies were made of the solubilities of
potassium, rubidiym, and cesium tetraphenyl-
borates in various organic solvents to ascertain
differential solubilities.

PART ill, SHIELDING RESEARCH
Shialding Analysis

Application of the Monte Carlo method to the
calculotion of gamma-ray penetration of crew
shie!d sides has been worked out, and the method
appears to be quite satisfactory for this type of
problem (Sec. 11). Considerable progress has been
made on understanding the Tower Shielding Fa-
cility (TSF) mecsurements of ground and air
scattering. Expressions have been derived which
describe the effect of ground interference with the
air-scattered flux, and thus it is now possible to
estimate ground-scaitered radiation both «t the
TSF and in on airplane at landing and ftakeoff,
Calculations have been set up for evaluating
multiply scattered radiation in air. The values
obtained will be of considerable importance in
studies of the highly asymmetric but light shields
of several current designs.

Lid York Shislding Facility

Preparations for a second series of shielding
tests for the reflector-modercted reactor ot the
Lid Tank Shielding Facility (LTSF) have included
the construction of a large tank which will hold
all the components of the mockups and the irradi-
ation of the UF C,F,  solution which may be
used to simulate the reactor fue! in mockup ex-
periments (Sec. 12). Measurements of the removal
cross section of carbon made in a continuous

o, = 0.750 barn. This is to be compared with the
previous value of 0.81 1 0.05 barn measured behind

‘Bulk Shielding Facility

The use of a graphite reflector as a shieid com-
ponent has been investigated at the Bulk Shielding
Facility (BSF) with measurements of attenugtion
through various thicknesses of the material (Sec.
13). The fast-neutron spectrum of the BSF reactor
from 1.3 1o 10 Mev through 1 ft of graphite was
also measured. Removal cross section values for
the carbon were determined to be 0.82 barn for a
1-ft slab, 0.84 barn for a 2-ft slab, and 0.80 barn
for a 3-ft slab.

An experiment has been performed at the BSF
to provide an experimental basis for future esti-
mates of the amount of visible light around o
nuclear-powered aircraft. Measurements in an air-
filled tube placed against the reactor have indi-
cated that the maximum glow will occur at!a

Tower Shielding Facility

Measurements of the ground and goir scattering
of neutrons have been made at the Tower Shielding
Facility (TSF) (Sec. 14). A preliminary anolysis
indicates that the contribution at the maximum
altitudes (around 200 ft) is between 2 and 5% of
the total scattered neutrons for differential ex-
periments.

A new procedure for a calorimetric determination
of the power of the TSF reactor has been devised
which is based on the relationship between the
rate of temperature rise in the water of the reactor
tank and the reactor power. The resuits of three
experiments were consistent to within 1%. The
next series of tests at the TSF will be on the

THE EXPERIMENTAL REACTOR SYSTEM

A general revision was found to be necessary
in the ARE ‘in that shadow shielding had to be
installed, at several points where elastomers were
used (belts, diaphragms, etc.),to provide protection
from gamma fields that would: have produced pro-
hibitive degrees of radiation damage. At some
points, where shielding was impractical, the compo-
sition diaphragms were replaced by metal dia-
phragms.

The entire ARE system has now been completely
checked out as far as rocometemperature preoper-
ational tests are concerned. Both the fuel and the
sodium circuits have been operated simultaneously
with water as the circulated liquid in each circuit.
The moderator volume of the reactor was bypassed
for these tests to keep water away from the be-
ryllium oxide blocks.

The sodium circuit was pressure-filled with
water from the sodium fill tanks, while the fuel
system was vacuum-filled to ensure the elimination
of gas pockets in the fuel system. Both systems
were found to function quite satisfactorily, and the
filling, circulating, and draining operations were
effected with a minimum of difficulty.

During these operational shakedown tests, it was
found that the gas lines to the sump tanks could
not be kept pressure tight because the Swagelok
fittings developed leaks. All these joints have
therefore been silver-soldered to correct this
situation,  The pumps performed satisfactorily,
and useful system curves for actual future operation
were obtained.

After the water tests of the system had been
completed, it was necessary to remove oll water
from the system. This necessitated heating the
entire system to o temperature of approximately
600°F. This operation provided the first check out
of the electrical heating system.
performance was gratifying.  Such troubles as
arose were corrected rather easily, and, in general,
the heating of the system was effected with very
little ditficulty.

A CO, cold trap was incorporated in the off-gas
line while the system was being heated to collect
all moisture that was driven from the system. Dry

Here again the

air was admitted to the fill tanks, and both the
fuel and the sodium systems were flushed with
this dry air, the air leaving the system through the
CO, cold trap. When the dew point of the exit air
from this cold frap reached ~30°F, the system was
considered to be dry and the electrical heat was
turned off.

Befare the heat was removed from the system,
however, the temperature on the thermal barrier
doors around the heat exchangers was raised to
approximately 1000°F and operation of the doors
was checked., Even though the doors had been
reworked to eliminate sticking, it was found that
the doors were still binding. When the barrier
doors were removed, it could be seen that the side
guides whichrun the height of the door were binding
in the guide ways of the door frames. This binding
was resulting from the bowing of the guide rails
caused by the thermal gradient which exists in the
door. The door does not require these side guides,
since the door housing provides ample guides for
the normal functioning of the doors. Therefore the
side guide rails are being removed so that there
will be no further binding of the barrier doors.

It was also noted while the system was hot that a
considerable volume of kerosene was being driven
out of the beryllium oxide moderator blocks by the
high tempercture. The kerosene had been absorbed
by the blocks during the cutting operations. To
remove the kerosene, a vacuum was pulled on the
moderator volume of the reactor. A CO, cold trap
was inserted in the vacuum line to the moderator,
and while the reactor wos maintained at a temper-
atyre of approximately 450°F, the vacuum pump was
run continvously. This operation was continued
until no more condensate of the kerosene distillation
was being collected in the cold trap. Approxi-
mately 2 gal of kerosene was removed by this
procedure. |t is possible — in fact, fairly certain -
that some residue was left in the moderator blocks.
It was the consensus of the chemists that this
would not have an adverse effect on the sodium
coolant, and therefore nothing further is to be done
about the small amount of tarry residue remaining
in the reactor moderator blocks, ’

the hot.gas leck test of the fuel system will be

methods for the presence of krypton in the annulus.

determined. Upon removal of the fuel heat ex-
changer bypass loop, a glass rotameter was tempo-
rarily installed in the fuel circuit between the
reactor outlet and the heat exchangers. A direct
calibration of the high-temperature fue! rotameter
against the glass rotameter was obtained with
water as the fluid. Conversion of water flow to

During the period of water operation, data on

Also, the pressure head from the pump suction to
the reactor inlet was measured (Fig. 1.2). The
system characteristics, as shown in these two
curves, should be the same during operation with
fluorides.

By using a calibrated orifice installed tempo-
rarily in the sodium bypass line around the reactor,
it was possible to measure the flow rate while
operating the sodium system with water. The
pump speed was recorded and alsc the pressure
head from the pump suction to the reactor outlet.
The system characteristics with water, shown in
Figs. 1.3 and 1.4, should be valid while operating
with sodium as the fluid. During operation with
sodium, the flow rate in each of the two loops will
be measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter.
The sum of the two flow rates should equal the
total flow as obtained from the pump speed.

PREPARATIONS FOR LOADING THE ARE

Mafericls Chemistry Division

All the preliminary preparations for loading the
barren and enriched fluoride mixtures into the ARE
have been completed. The necessary control
panels have been assembled, and furnaces, heating
units, transfer lines, and various complementary
equipment are now ready for installation. The
exact location of the various operations has been
determined.. However, because of the large amount
of construction work which has been carried out in

il
ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

the ARE building around these locations, none of
the parts necessary for the loading and sampling
operations have yet been installed. Testing of the
equipment ofter installation and before the filling
operation should require approximately ore week.
It is anticipated that all personnel to be invelved
with the loading and sampling operation will be
made thoroughly familiar with the equipment and
its operation during this testing period.

of the aluminum cans to minimize the possibility
of melting these containers.

For the second test the apporatus was filled
with 500 1b of NaF.-ZrF, (50-50 mole %), and this
material was fransferred at 1200 to 1250°F to the
aluminum cans in 70~ to %0:1b increments without
difficulty, Attempis to transfer at 1100 to 1150°F,
however, led to occasional freezing at the pouring
spout and indicated that unless much more reliable
temperoture control could be effected, operation
at this low temperature could hardly be considered
to be feasible.

The fuel from an aircraft reactor would be re-

the uranium hexafluoride from excess fluorine by
trapping the uranium salt in a cold trap and re-
subliming the UF [ from it, and fabrication of a new

in the scrubbing step was less than 0.001%. Frac-
tional distillation of the UF  from this step, which
would be performed in order to obtain complete
decontamination, could be carried out in only lightly
shieided equipment.

Two experiments on scrubbing UF , with molten
NaF-ZrF, were carried out. In one, an acetone-dry
ice cold trap was used between the fluorination and
scrub steps; the uranium hexafluoride was cone
densed {and thus separated from excess fluorine)
in the cold trap and was then resublimed from it.
The uranium was recovered from the scrub salt by

trap was used, but the decontamination obtained
was the same (Table 1.1). it is thought that
resublimation of the salt-scrubbed product would
achieve additional decontamination.

runs by dissolving a 224-day-irradiated, 30-day-

had a compesition of 54.0-42.4-3.6 mole % and an

The conversion of UF, to UF, in Run A was
relatively poor, with 1.6% remaining in the fluori-
nation salt. This was due to a fluorination period
of only 3 hr. A longer fluorination period of 5 hr
lowered the loss to 0.003%. The same time was
used in refluorinating the scrub salt of Run B to
recover 98.5 wt % of the initial uranium, Since

Seal-Gas Pressure-Balancing System

W. G. Cobb

Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

A seal-gaos pressure-balancing system was de-
veloped and has been installed in the ARE pumps.
This system automatically maintains agaspressure
in the lubricant chamber around the lower me-
chanical seal that is slightly higher (]/2 to 2 psi)
than the pressure in the pump tank volume in order
to impede the outward leakage of vapors into the
lubricating-oil system. The equipment involved
consists of a differential supply valve, a differ-
ential vent valve, and the requisite pipe con-
nections. In addition to providing a master-slave
relationship for maintaining the pressure differ-
ential across the seal, the system has two charde-
teristics which are advantageous to ARE pump
operation.  The first advantage is that it will
provide automatic bleed-off of excessive oil system
pressures created by the gas which will be evolved
from irradiation of the lubricating oil. The second
advantage is that it will maintain a greater (1’2- to
2-psi) pressure across the lower seal even when
subatmospheric pressures are introduced to the
pump tank, for example, when the ARE fuel system
is being vacuum filled.

Radiation Damage to Pump Drives

W. G. Cobb A. G. Grindell

Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

Some alternatives to the usual V-belt pump-

power transmission system were investigated
in an attempt to find a system that would not be
affected by radiation. The alternatives studied in-
cluded direct in-line drives, angle-gear-box drives,
silent-chain drives, and improved V-belt drives.
The use of direct drives would have required
modification of the concrete shielding above the
pump pits, and the use of the angle-gear-box drive
would have required development of suitable lubri-
cant seals. The silent-chain drive tested did not
have the required mechanical reliability.®

Two improved V-belts, a Browning B-105 Super-
grip belt (rayon cords in a neoprene matrix) and a
Browning B-103 Grip belt (cotton cords in a rubber
matrix), were irradiated, under operating tension,
through a short length of the belt by a Co%? source
to total doses of 10% and 107 rep, respectively.

After irradiation each belt was used in the cold
shakedown test stand to drive a pump rotary ele-
ment at 1600 rpm with no pump load. After 90 hr
of operation, the B-105 belt showed no visible
damage and was returned to ARE personnel. After
75 hr of operation, the B-103 belt showed no visible
damage and was transferred to the pump in the
reactor component test loop pump to transmit 3 hp
at 800 rpm. This belt, which has now been in
service for more than 900 hr, has increased in
length approximately 1 in. Failure of the belt
does not appear to be imminent, and pump operation
has not been affected. An idler pulley is used to
maintain tension,

On the basis of these tests, it was decided to
use the cotton-corded, rubber-matrix V-belts on
the fuel and the sodium pumps in the ARE. As an
additional sofeguard, the belt on the fuel pump
drive will be shielded with lead.

Radiation Damage to Shaft Seal

Solid State Division

The rotary subassembly of the ARE pump con-
tains six Buna-N O-ring static seals which will
receive radiation during reactor operation. To get
information on the expected life of these seals,
an O-ring sealing arrangement similar to two of
the pump seals was constructed and was placed in
the LITR flux. The test assembly included six
radial O-ring seals and three gasket O-ring seals.
One side of the seals was supplied with oil at
75-psig pressure, and the other side was vented to
the reactor off-gas system through bubblers and a
catch tank so that it was possible to detect any
appreciable leakage by the seals. Since the seals

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1954

were vented in four groups, it wos possible to get
some information on variations in seal life. Differ-
ences in the following might produce such vari-
ations: (1) flux density over test assembly,
(2) twisting and rolling of the rings during assembly
for testing, (3) the O-rings, and (4) the machined
parts.

The gomma radiation intensity at the test lo-
cation in the LITR was estimated by extrapolation
from data taken on the Bulk Shielding Facility.”
The neutron flux was negligible. The resulis are
reported in Table 1.2, which gives time of irradi-
ation to first observed leakage and the total esti-
mated dose to first leakage. Examination of the
O-rings aofter irradiation revealed substantial
hardening. No appreciable elastic recovery of the
rings occurred upon removal from the container.

The O-rings to be used in the ARE will not be
in sohigh a flux as that used for these experiments,
and they will be under much lower pressures,
Since it is not essential in the ARE application
that the O-rings retain their resiliency, the resuits
of these experiments do not have immediate signifi-
cance. It is evident from these tests, however,
that O-rings cannot be used successfully in future
high-power reactor applications.

Operation of the reactor system component test
loop® at K-25 was temporarily halted after 1047 hr
of operation to remove one ARE core hairpin tube
for metallographic examination, Shutdown, tube
removal, tube replacement, and re-startup were
accomplished under a complete helium blanket to
prevent air from contaminating the fluoride mixture
or the inside of the Inconel system. An irradiated
V-belt that was installed, as described above,
after 875 hr of system operation has operated for
more than 900 hr of the approximately 1800 hr
of system operation. Plugging of gas line con-
nections to the pump tank by ZrF ,-vapor condensate
has occurred periodically. In some instances the
plugs have been removed by heating the gas line
involved and blowing the vaporized ZrF, back
into the pump tank. No completely satisfactory
solution to this problem has been found to date;
the wvse of o lorge-capacity vapor trap is being
studied as a possible solution.

fore it appears that corrosion from impurities will
not be a serious problem in the ARE. Since this

should have been worse than those in the ARE.
No information on the amount of corrosion that
may be expected from mass transfer could be
obtained because the loop is being operated isc-

Four years of work on the ANP Project ot ORNL.
have led to the belief that the circulating-fluoride-
fuel reactor with reflector moderation and a spheri-
cal-shefl heat exchanger can be developed into
an aircraft power plant of exceptionally high per-
formance.!  This view has been supported ‘in
recent months by the results of studies by USAF
contractors. - The question has now become how
best to bridge the gap between the ARE and a
prototype aircraft power plant.

It was proposed about a year ago that a 50-Mw
reactor be built so that the feasibility of con-
structing and operating a circulating-fuel reflector-
moderated reactor could be investigated and its
performance characteristics, particularly with ref-
erence to control, shielding, heat transfer, and fluid
flow, could be determined. Preliminary estimates
indicated that a power of at least 25 Mw would
be required to disclose the more important control
characteristics. Other studies indicated that an
output of 50 Mw would be required for the lowest
powered aircraft likely to be tactically useful (for
radar picket. ships, patrol bombers, etc.), while
an output of 150 to 200 Mw would be required (with
chemical-fuel augmentation)} to power a strategic
bomber. Preliminary reactor test unit designs and
cost estimates indicated that the time and cost
involved would be roughly propertional to the rated
output of the reactor (largely because the size
and cost of the heat exchangers, pumps, and heat-
dump equipment vary directly with reactor power).
After much analysis and discussion it was decided
that 60 Mw represented a good compromise for the
power rating -and that such a reactor, to be called
the Circulating-Fuel Reactor Experiment (CFRE),
should be built by ORNL, with the aid of the
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Division. This test unit
is to embody the basic features and proportions
that have made the circulating-fuel reactor at-
tractive for aircraft use, but the details of the
pumps, radiators, and cuxiliary equipment will not
have to meet aircraft requirements of size, weight,
etc. An operating life of 500 hr, of which a sub-
stantial portion should be at or near 60 Mw, was

considered to be a desirable goal. The information
gained from this project should serve to provide
a sound basis for the design of the full-scale
aircraft reactor.

As has been the case with the ARE, the CFRE
will require a major supporting effort on the part
of various. groups in the ORNL organization to
obtain much essential information not yet avail-
able. The program on fuel chemistry, for example,
will continue along the lines it has followed. The
results of research on both the basic chemistry
and the in-pile and out-of-pile corrosion tests are
obviously vital to the project. Metallurgical re-
search on promising alloys, welding and brazing
techniques, strength properties at various tempera-
tures and in various ambients, and related work
will help greatly to increase the reliability, and
possibly the operating temperature, of the system.
Tests under way ot the Tower Shielding Facility
coupled with further Lid Tank Shielding Facility
tests will provide a more complete basis for the
aircraft shield design. Multigroup calculations
coupled with critical experiments should provide
additional information on the static physics of
the reactor. Much test work in experimental engi-
neering will be required to validate key features
of the design.

DESIGN OF THE CFRE

be simplified if simplification proves to be ex-
pedient. l arge blowers coupled to banks of NaK-
to-air radiators will be used to provide heat dumps
that will be simpler, more reliable, and easier to
control than turbojet engines. While conventional
heat exchangers like those of the ARE might be
used, experience in fobricating and testing tube-
and-plate finned radiators® indicates that aircraft-
type radiators should cost little more and that they
will make o much neater, more compact instal-
lation.  Further, they will effect a manyfold re-
duction in the NaK heoldup in the system and will
give a thermal inertia and a NaK transit time es-
sentially the same as those for a full-scale aircraft
power plant. The fabricating and operating ex-
perience obtained should also prove to be quite
valuable, |t appears that d-c motors will be the
most practical means for driving the various pumps
in the system, but the blowers will probably be
driven by a-c motors, with control being effected
by the use of air bypass valves and/or shutters.

CFRE COMPONENT DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
The projected design effort for the CFRE has

been tied closely to o comprehensive series of
component development projects. A list of these
projects as currently conceived is given in Table
2.5. 1t is fully expected that the need for ad-
ditional projects will develop as the program
evolves, but those listed should provide the most
important information required.

The first project was completed recently, and
the results are presented below; work on some of
the other projects is well under way. The test
of beryllium in contact with sodium and Inconel
under thermal stress was given high priority be-
cause the results were needed in the determination
of the amount of poison to be expected in the

reflector. With the amount of poison in the re-

flector known, the reactor critical mass, the core
size, the fuel concentration, etc. could be de-
termined. In the second test, which is well under
way, the hydrodynamics of the pump-volute, ple-
num-chamber, and core system are being studied.
Work on the same basic problem is also being done
by the Heat Transfer and Physical Properties
Group and by the Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Di-
vision. It is hoped that the different approaches
of the three groups will lead to a thoroughly sound
solution. The objective of the third project is to
produce a plastic model of a pump and header-tank
arrangement that will remove xenon from the fuel,
Data on the solubility of xenon in the fuel and on
the rate of production of xenon in the fuel are
being obtained by the Fuel Chemistry and Radi-
ation Damage groups; the data thus obtained will
provide a measure of the efficiency of xenon re-
moval by the pump, An in-pile test of a full-scale
pump may be required eventually. Xenon removal
by the pump is very important, from the control
standpoint; in addition, if it can be effected as
planned, the bulk of the other volatile fission
products will also be removed. This will dispose
of a major potential hazard in the event of a
reactor failure and should simplify the reactor
installation design problem.

The information given in Table 2.5 for most
of the other component development projects is
largely self-explanatory. To expedite the work,
some of the projects can be undertaken by other
organizations; for example, another organization
might undertake the entire job of designing, de-
veloping, and fabricating the fill-and-drain system,
the fuel addition equipment, the control rod drive
mechanism, or the sample heat exchanger tube

bundle.

The last project listed, the Zero Power Unit
(ZPU), deserves special mention. Experience with
the ARE has demonstrated that many problems will
arise in the fabrication of the CFRE and that there
will be o number of doubtful items, especially
welds, that could hardly be trusted in a high-power
reactor. This seems particularly true of the re-
actor core, heat exchanger, and pressure shell
assembly, If it is accepted that the first attempt
at fabricating the uwnit will leave much to be de-
sired, planning to use it as a hot mockup seems
to be more sensible than spending much time and
money trying to rework and patch it. It can be

nuclear power. Even if a leak should develop in
one of the welds, there would be no serious con-
tamination problem. Upon completion of the en-
durance test, it should not be difficult to make a
thorough inspection of the parts —~ something that
could hardly be done after sustained operation at
high nuclear power.

At first thought, the ZPU might appear to delay
the program, but closer inspection indicates that
it may actually save a substantial amount of time,
because efforts to get it into operation can proceed
at full speed without the inevitable hazards, re-

20

inhibitions, and hesitations that would
accompany high nuclear power operation. Work on
the CFRE can proceed at o more deliberate pace,
and the mistakes disclosed by work on the ZPU
can be avoided. The degree to which the ZPU
will be a mockup of the CFRE will depend upon
the problems that develop in the course of the
component test work. It is hoped that a 10-Mw
gas-fired furnace can be used, in place of one of
the two CFRE heat dumps, in making some heat
transfer tests on the fluoride-to-NaK heat ex-
changer and in obtaining a temperature gradient

The three-group, three-region code for reactor
statics calculations® on the ORACLE has been
completed. The temperature effects for the CFRE
were computed on the UNIVAC for three reactors:
a 50-Mw reactor with Incone! coolant tubes in the
reflector, a reactor without these tubes, and a
reactor in which the !Inconel in the core shells was
replaced by columbium clad with 0.010 in. of
The temperature coefficient for rapid
temperature changes turned out to be about -3.5 x
1073 /°F, and the temperature coefficient for slow
effects is —2.6 x 1072 /°F for the heavily poisoned
reactor with the Inconel coolant tubes, but it in-
creases to —3.3 x 107°/°F and -3.8 x 1073 /°F,
respectively, for the reactor without the lnconel
coolant tubes and the reactor with the Inconel-clad
columbium core shells.

ect. A report on the results of the latter calcu-
lations is being prepared and will be issued by the
Curtiss-Wright Corp.

A redetermination of the critical mass for the
(CA-19)
was found to be necessary because of an error in
carbon transport cross-section scaling, a differ-

rhombicuboctahedron critical assembly

ence in reftlector geometry from that assumed for
the original calculations, and an actual Teflon
density lower than that used in the calculations.
In addition, a small correction {about 1% of critical
mass) was made for the presence of the aluminum
lattice supporting the reactor and for the aluminum
control red sheaths.

The eigenvalues of the difference-equation ap-
proximation fo the age-diffusion differential equa-
tion vary with lattice spacing. Calculations were
therefore made with three different spacings in
order to evaluate this effect. A foil of 0.004 in.
thickness was used in the calculagtions. The
resuvlts, corrected as mentioned in the preceding
paragraph, are given in the following:

Space Interval, Ar Calculated Critical Mass

(em) (Ib)

0.457 22.75
0.914 21.47
1.828 20.91

The data are plotted in Fig. 2.2. A Lagrangian
extrapolation to a zero lattice spacing gives a
critical mass estimate of 24.70 Ib. The assembly
became critical at a loading of 24.35 b of U233,

It is recognized that the agreement between
calculation and experiment may well be fortuitous,
since the critical mass is not very sensitive to
errors in detail. Further evaluation of agreement
(or lack thereof) must await additional experi-
mental results. Calculations are now being made
for the next critical assemblies, that is, the three-
region assemblies consisting of a beryllium island
and reflector with a Teflon and uranium-foil fuel
annulus. The fuel annulus will be surrounded by
core shells; aluminum core shells will be used for
one assembly and Inconel for the next.

effects of severe thermal stresses in beryllium at
temperatures between 1000 and 1300°F.% 1% There
has been serious concern as to whether cracking
or distortion in the beryllium would prove to be a
major problem. Therefore a test on the beryllium
block shown in Fig. 2.3 was devised to investigate
the effects of power (and hence thermal) cycling.
The test loop used is shown in Fig. 2.4. Heat
was generated in the beryllium block by simple
electrical-resistance heating with a current of
about 15,000 amp through the beryllium block.

tube bank to the corresponding holes in the be-
ryllium block, through the upper tube back into
the outlet header, out to the radiator section, and
back to the pump. Banks of tubes were used to
duct the sodium to and from the block to minimize
the flow of electrical current through the sodium
inlet and outlet header tanks. A bypass filter
arrangement was provided, as well as bypass
cooling flow to the sodium-filled lugs connected
to the transformer bus bars.

The high-power-density volume heat source
coupled with transverse sodium flow through the
drilled holes gave a high thermal gradient around
the holes. During the course of the test the power
density was cycled regularly by alternating the

28

operating conditions as shown in Table 2.6, which
also compares the operating conditions for the
thermal stress test with those for the CFRE,

The test included an initial 100-hr period at a
constant high power density followed by power
cycling at the rate of one cycle per day. The
changes from one power level to the other were,
in all cases, performed at a fairly uniform rate in
a l-min interval. The test was concluded after
1000 hr of operation, including 36 cycles. The
beryllium sample is now being examined by the
Metallurgy Division for dimensional stability and
evidence of mass transfer, corrosion, or erosion.
Visual inspection of the sample after the test
indicated that no distortion, cracking, or erosion
of the beryllium had taken place.

BERYLLIUM-INCONEL-50DIUM SYSTEMS

The compatibility of sodium, beryllium, and In-
conel has been studied by using whirligig, seesaw,
thermal-convection-loop, and = forced-circulation-
loop tests. The results obtained to date indicate
that it will be possible to use beryllium unclad
in the CFRE if the temperature of the sodium-
beryllium-Inconel region (that is, the reflector and
the island) is kept below 1200°F. The main effect
observed thus for in the tests has been the type
of mass transfer usually found when dissimilar
metals are used in a system. In this case the
mass transfer has been evidenced by the alloying
of beryllium with the Inconel walls in regions
where the beryllium and Inconel were close to-
gether, with only stagnant sodium separating them.

Beryllium-lhconel-Sodium Compatibility Tests

E. E. Hoffman W. H. Cook
C. R. Brooks C. F. Leitten
Metallurgy Division

Nine tests of the compatibility of beryllium,
sodium, and inconel in dynamic systems have been
completed (Table 2.7). In the whirligig tests o
circular loop of Inconel tubing with a berylllum
insert was pdrfiy filled with sodium which was
circulated at o velocity of 10 fps. For four of

 

these tests there was no temperature differential,
but for one test there was a differential of 140°F.
These tests were of 300-hr duration. Two thermal-
convection loops of Inconel with beryllium inserts
were tested for 1000 hr with sodium circulating
at a relatively low velocity (approximately 2 to
10 fpm). In addition, seesaw tests were performed
in which beryllium specimens were retained in the
hot zones of osciilating Inconel tubes partly filled
with sodium which cvrculoted at a velocity of

3 fpm.

Macroscopic examination failed to show attack
on the Inconel, but two specimens showed de-
posits. Black layers were formed in the annular
space between the beryllium insert and the en-
closing Inconel sleeve in the whirligig and thermal-
convection-loop tests. The layer was very ad-
herent and made removal of the insert difficult;
consequently, the weight change data obtained
were not considered as being relmb!e.

A picture of this layer from © whirligig ioop
operated at 1300°F is shown in Fig. 2.5. Micro-
scopic examination showed that the maximum depth
of attack on the inside surface of the Inconel did
not exceed 0.5 mil. Chemical analysis of the
sodium bath reveaied less than 0.04% berylliom
in the sodium. In all tests, beryllium was detected

3. EXPERIMENTAL REACTOR ENGINEERING
H. W. Savage

Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

The emphasis in the engineering work has shified
to research and component development for the
CFRE and for in-pile loops, since most of the
preoperational ARE tests have been completed.
Twe types of puinps have been developed for in-
pile loop use, The vertical-shaft centrifugal sump
pump, which would be installed outside the reoctor
shield and thus would require auxiliary shielding,
is now being fabricated in sufficient quantity to
meet the demands of the in-pile loop program and
the forced-circulation corrosion testing program,
The small (4-in.-OD)}, air-driven, horizontal-shaft
sump pump being developed for insertion in a
reactor beam hole was tested with NaF-ZiF, at
1350°F.  Some difficulty was encountered with
initial priming, but operation was otherwise satis-
factory. A new, small pump that has the required
small holdup volume is being designed. This
pump, which will use o turbine-type impeller, has
the advantage that both the inlet and discharge
can be at the bottom. Hydraulic drive motors of
suitably small dimensions have been found to be
satisfoctory drives for these pumps.

Additional work has been done on the development
of forced-circulation corrosion-testing loops for
obtaining information on the corrosion of Inconel
in high-velocity turbulent fluoride mixtures with
large temperature differentials in the system. Two
series of loops are being constructed to meet the
following requirements: a Reynolds number of
10,000 with temperature gradients of 100, 200, and
300°F and o temperature grodient of 200°F with
Reynolds numbers of 800, 3,000, and 15,000. The
maximum fluid temperature is to be 1500°F. A
forced-circulation loop is also being developed for
testing combinations of structural metals in contact
with high-velocity turbulent liquid metals under
high temperature differentials,

IN-PILE LOOP COMPONENT DEVELOPMENT

¥W. B, McDonald

Aircratt Reactor Engineering Division

An in-pile loop for insertion in the MTR is to be
designed, constructed, and operoted as a joint
ORNL and Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Division
project. The loop is being developed for circu.
lating proposed fuel mixtures so that the extent
of radiation damage to materials of construction and
the effect of radiation on the fuel can be de-
termined, Preliminary ORNL work on this project
is concerned with the design and development of
components of a loop to operate in o horizontal
beam hole. Further developmental work was also
done on the vertical-shaft centrifugal pump for use
with both in-pile and out-of-pile forced-circu-
lation loops.

Horizontal-Shaft Sump Pump
D. F. Salmon J. A, Conlin

Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

The air-driven horizontal-shaft sump pump de-
scribed previously! was operated with NaF-ZrF ,
at 1350°F, |t produced a 70-psi head at 6000 rpm
and a flow rate of 1.5 gpm. Initial difficulty in
priming the pump was solved by momentarily
flooding the impel!ler labyrinth. This pump, which
was built as a pilot model for checking design
principles, hot pump performance, and reliability,
has too large a volume holdup for in-pile use and
will now be used as a laboratory pump.

A new pump has been desighed that has the
required small pump holdup volume. For priming,
this design incorporates a boffle in the sump tank
that will permit remote, momentary flooding of the
impeller eye and the labyrinth behind the impeller.
A turbine-type impeller is used instead of the
conventional centrifugal impeller.

it has been experimentally determined, with
water, that the turbine type of impeller will prime
itself if the inlet and outlet are placed at the
bottom of the pump and the fluid is maintained at
a level about half way between the bottom of the
impeller and the impeller center. The horizontal
sump pump principle is used, with the sump having
a minimum volume that acts merely as an expansion
chamber and a reservoir to replace and catch the
fluid leaking past the labyrinth seal. Excessive
impeller end clearances are necessary for this
type of pump because of the severe temperature
gradients present. However, estimated available
pump heads (25 ft at 4500 rpm and 1.5 gpm} are
greater than the estimated requirements. Hydraulic
efficiency of the pump will be low but performance
will be reliable.

Further work has been done on centrifugally
sealed and frozen-fluoride-sealed pumps, and it
has been established that the centrifugally sealed
pump requires too greata volume of fluid for sealing
for it to be considered for in-pile use and that the
leakage rate of the frozen-fluoride-sealed pump is
excessive. However, the centrifugally sealed
pump, which will be useful for other applications,
has been modified to include a system that makes
the pump self-priming and deaerating. By con-
trolling the seal level and using a proper venting

sequence, the pump can be easily stopped and
restarted. A pilot mode! of the pump, similar to
the pump previously described,? has been designed
that incorporates these features (Fig. 3.1} and an
integral sump tank connected by a passage to the
seal cavity.

In operation, the system would be filled tc the
full level. The seal cavity and sump tank would
then be pressurized through the gas inlet tube to
the predetermined pressure necessary to obtain a
positive pump inlet pressure during operation, and
the pump would be started. The centrifugal force
would cause the liquid in the seal cavity to form a
rotating annulus. The annulus of fluid would
develop a small pressure and thus pump fluid into
the discharge tube, through the loop, and back to
the pump. The small bieed hole from the pump
discharge to the sump tank would permit deaeration
by bypussing aerated fluid from the pump into the
sump. The bypassed fluid would be replaced by
clear fluid from the seal. When the pump was
primed and deaerated, a continuous flow of fluid
would pass from the bleed hole to the sump to
remove any accumulation of gas. Throughout this
operation, fluid entering the loop from the seal to
either fill the loop or replace the bleed flow would
be replaced by fluid from the sump, and sufficient
fluid would thus be in the seal for sealing. There-
fore there is a lower limit on the run level in the

times to provide the necessary flow into the seal.

To stop the unit, the sump tank would be vented
at the same time the pump was stopped, but the
gas pressure would be maintained unti! draining
had been completed. This would cause a flow of
gas along the shaft into the seal cavity and would
blow out any fluid that might enter along the shoft.
I+ would also maintain a seal cavity pressure
somewhat greater than the sump tank pressure and
would force the fluid out of the seal into the sump.
If this procedure were not followed, the sealing
annulus of fluid would, upon collapsing when the
pump was stopped, momentarily fill the seal cavity
above the shaft level and cause fluid to enter
along the shaft,

Vertical-Shaft Centrifugal Sump Pump
D. R. Ward

Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

Developmental work has been continued on the
vertical-shaft cenirifugal sump pump (Model LFB)
for use with forced-circulation loops, both in-pile
and out. This is a vertical-shaft cenirifugal sump
pump with a side inlet and a bottom discharge
(Fig. 3.2). A Graphitar face seal prevents the
pressurizing gas from escaping along the shaft.
Circulating spindle oil serves to lubricate this
face seal and to carry away heat from the seal
region.

Typical performance curves for this pump with
water are shown in Fig. 3.3. In o recent test the
pump was run for 864 hr at 6000 rpm while pumping
1400°F sodium at about 3 gpm. Typical oil leakage
past the shaft face seal was under 0.1 cm3/hr.

Developmental work during the past eight months
has resulted in the following improvements in this
pump: the elimination of the tendency for the pump
to introduce gas into the liquid stream at flow
rates up to 6 gpm; an improved anti-flowback seal
to prevent recirculation of the liquid within the
pump; an improved means for cooling the face-seal
region of the pump; and a reduction of pump volume,
which is desirable when the pump is used for
in-pile loop tests.

The main difficulty, that of gas entrainment, was
primarily caused by vortexing and the passage of
gas downward along the rotating shaft. The ad-

dition of vertical baffles adjacent to the shaft
merely broke up the large vortex into several
smaller ones, which were just os objectionable.
The problem is solved in the present arrangement
by permitting liquid from the high-pressure region
of the pump to be bypassed up through a hole in
the shaft to an annular space surrounding the
shaft.  This liquid, in turn, forms a seal and
prevents the gas from following its former path.

Acceptance tests for these pumps include oper-
ating each pump with water to check the pumping
characteristics and freedom from gas entrainment
and pumping sodium at T1400°F for 72 hr at 6000
rpm with acceptable oil leakage past the face seal.
This hot test also serves to clean oxide film from
the wetted pump parts, as well as to reveal any
mechanical faults that might be present. Five of
these pumps are being built, and four similar
pumps {Model LFA} are now in use.

Hydrauvlic Motor Pump Drives
4. A. Conlin

Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

Two types of hydraulic motors have been found
to be suitable for use os in-pile pump drives. The
first, a gear-type motor rated at 1.75 shp at 3500
rpm, was operated at 6000 rpm for 500 hr under a
light load (about 0.08 shp) that was obtained by
Upon
completion of the test the motor was disassembled
and was found to be in good condition. The rubber
lip shaft seal had worn a slight groove in the
shaft, and o carbon-like deposit which had ac-
cumulated on the shaft just outside the seal caused
the seal to stick slightly after it had been idle for
a prolonged period. However, throughout the test,
sea! leakage was nregligible. The only other indi-
cation of weoar was a slight scoring on the gear
sides adjocent to the shaft end of the motor.

The second motor, an axial-piston type rated at
3.8 shp at 6060 rpm continuous duty, was run for
100 hr at 6000 rpm. Operation was completely
satisfactory, and, since this motor is rated at
6060 rpm, further testing was judged to be un-
necessary.

The axialepiston motor was chosen for in-pile
service, since it is considered to he the more
reliable unit. Throughout these tests, hydraulic
oil with a viscosity of 155 SSU (seconds Saybolt
universal) at 100°F and a viscosity index of 100
It should be noted that during initial
testing of the gear-type motor, oil with a viscosity
of 290 to 325 SSU at 100°F was used, and, as a
result, excessive overheating of the motor occurred
to the extent that the shaft turned blue. Despite
this, the motor completed the test satisfactorily.

at ain apparent mass flow rate of 400 to 450 Btu/hr
with a temperature differential up to 300°F.% The

fluid velocity in the loop normally was maintained
at about 1.7 fps at a temperature gradient of 165°F.
Termination of the test resulted from a short in
the motor leads and subsequent rupture of the
heated section of the loop. The test facility,
shown in Fig. 3.4, is being rebuilt and is approxi-
mately 80% complete. The final design conditions
are presented in Fig. 3.5. Reports which give a
detailed presentation of the design and an analysis
of the initial operation are being prepared.?s3

In the design of the loop for electrical-resistance
heating, a resistivity value® of 98 gohm-cm was
used for Inconel in computing the necessary length
of the resistonce-heated tube. However, data
obtained during the loop operation indicated that
the actual resistivity of the Inconel was about
70 to 80 pohm-cm. To resolve the discrepancy, a
duplicate of the heuating section of the loop was
filled with NaF-ZrF .UF, (50-46-4 mole %) and
alternately heated and
potential ond current measurements were made.
Sixty-two measurements were made in the tempera-
ture range of 800 to 1600°F, and the average
resistivity of the Inconel was found to be 75

A program is under way for the design, con-
struction, and operation of two series of forcad-
circulation loops for studying the effect of temper-
ature gradient and fluid velocity on the phenomenon
of mass transfer in Inconel systems containing
fluoride mixtures at elevated temperatures.” The
requirements of the two series of loops are a
Reynolds number of 10,000 with temperature gradi-
ents of 100, 200, and 300°F and o temperature
gradient of 200°F ond Reynolds numbers of 800,
3,000, and 15,000. The maximum fluid tempercture
is specified as 1500°F, and the Reynolds numbers
are to be evaluated at that temperature. The loops
are to be consiructed of Inconel tubing. The
maximum tube-wall temperature is to be 1700°F,
and the surface-to-volume rotio is to be held
essentially the same for each loop.

A summary of the design dimensions and expected
operating conditions for each of the six loops is
presented in Table 3.1, which also indicates the
current status of each loop. Three methods of
heating were studied: electrical-resistance, gas-
fired furnace, and liquid bath. The liquid bath
was discounted because it would require pres-
surization of the liquid metal an excessively long
heat exchanger,and a large investment. A gas-
fired furnace was considered, but lack of operating
experience and the high heat flux necessary for
the loops indicated the use of electrical heating,
with which considerable experience has been ob-
tained. A gas-fired furnace is being studied as a
possible heat source for a large number of cor-

A loop for testing combinations of structural
metals in contact with high-velocity turbulent
liquid metals under high temperature differentials
is being developed. If combinations of materials
are found that are satisfactory for use in liquid
metal systems, greater flexibility and ease of
construction may be attained. An optimized design,
patterned after that used for beryllium-Inconel-
sodium mass transfer tests {cf. Sec. 2, “'Reflector-
Moderated Reactor’’), has been developed and is
to be used first for testing combinations of Inconel
and type 316 stainless steel in sodium.

GAS-FURNACE HEAT-SOURCE DEVELOPMENT

University of Mississippi

Several exploratory tests were made of com-
merciai and ORNL-designed-and-fabricated burners
for use with the gas-furnace heat source described
previously.'? The heat release intensity desired

is on the order of 3000 Btu/ft3.sec, which is of the
same order as that attained in jet aircraft burners.

The maximum rate of heat release obtained in
the tests, 170 Btu/ft%, was obtained with the
burner designed by A. P. Fraas. The results of
these exploratory tests are presented in Table 3.2.
Although the rate of heot release contemplated in
the original design (about 3000 Btu/ft3.sec) was
not approached in these tests, it appears that
rates higher than 170 Btu/ft3.sec can be attained
by securing more rapid mixing of air and gas,
preheating the combustion-air, and providing a
positive pressure in the combustion chamber.
Additional tests are to be made.

on the cavitation phenomenon in forced-circulation
high-temperature sodium systems, a preliminary

study was initiated,

Tests were run on the ARE hot pump test facility
in which pressures at the venturi throat could be
varied by varying the pressure of the blanketing
gas. Thus it was possible to vary the pressures
without changing the pump speed, the throttle
valve setting, or the temperature. Data were taken
during eight runs at temperatures in the range
1200 to 1500°F. Measurements were made of pump
discharge pressure, venturi throat pressure, and
pump suction pressure as the pump suction pres-
sure was varied, Cavitation was found to begin
when the venturi throat pressure ceased to decrease
uniformly with decreasing pump suction pressure.
Also, as cavitation began, the loop pressure drop
increased and the flow rate decreased. Observation
of fluid flow noise revecled a coirelation of noise
intensity with pressure data.

The pressure at which cavitation occurred cannot
be exactly ascertained, since the pressure at the
middle of the throat of the venturi is obviously
not the lowest pressure in the venturi. In water
cavitation, bubbles form at the start of the flow
expansion, and, in the particular venturi used, the
rather sharp radius at the transition from the throat
to the diffusion cone probably coused flow sepo-
The minimum pressures cbserved at the
throat were within 1 psi of the vapor pressure of

Instrumentation for measurement of subaimos-

pheric pressures was required for these high-
temperature (up to 1500°F) sodium-cavitation
studies. A Moore null-balance bellows-type pres-

sure transmitter and a Moore Model 60-N *‘nullmatic’’
pilot valve modified to vent the pilot valve to «
vacuum source proved to be satisfactory for this
application. When the venting atmosphere or sink
pressure is reduced, the unit is capable of meas-
uring correspondingly process pressures.
Pressure measurements were made over the range
of 20 to 1.6 psia, with the sodium-filled transmitter
maintained at about 650°F. The zero shift of the
pressure transmitter ranged from +0.3 to 0.2 in.
Hg over the range.

A second check of the zero shift was made as
the transmitter temperature was varied from 800 1o
470°F with a constant system pressure of approxi-
mately 16.2 psia. The zero shift then observed was
+0.1 to -0.2 in, Hg. In general, the performance
ot this pressure-measuring device was quite satis-
factory; a more highly refined application of this
device might lead to even smaller zero shift. A
report covering this modification is being prepared.

EXPANSION AND IMPROVEMENT OF THERMAL-
CONVECTION LOOP TESTING FACILITIES

E. M. Lees

Aircraft Reactor tngineering Division

The number of power panels installed for sup-
plying thermal-convection loops has been expanded
from 18 to 31 so that tests of long duration and
extensive tests of ‘‘new’’ materials can be made
rapidly. Materials such as the Hastelloy alloys,
molybdenum, and nickel-molybdenum alloys are
to be tested to determine the effects of time,
temperature, temperature difference, loop pre-
cleaning methods, fluid pretreatment methods,
corrosion inhibitors, etc.

Samples of newly designed heating equipment
have been ordered for study, with the expectation
of replacing the present method of installing

custom-tailored heating units and insulation on
each loop. Split-tube furnaces that would remain
in place from test to test may possibly be used.
The possibilities of automatizing operation of the
loops and of providing safeguards in case of
shutdowns because of power failures or other
emergencies are also being studied. The loops
have been redesigned so that they require fewer
welds, and the sharp angles of liquid flow have
been eliminated. Figure 3.6 shows the old and
the improved designs.

The first step of the present critical experiment
program was the construction of a small two-region
reflector-moderated reactor to provide experimental
data on a system of simple geometry and materials
for use in checking the present calculational
methods.’ The assembly is approximately spheri-
cal, 41 in. in outside diameter, and has a center, or
core region, that is about 15 in. in diameter.? The
core consists of alternate sheets of enriched
uranium metal (4 mils thick) and Teflon, (CFz)n'
and is surrounded by a beryllium reflector. It is
possible to vary the uranium loading, within the
specified dimensions, in order to make the system
critical, The Teflon and the uranium have been cut
to the various shapes necessary to form the sub-
assemblies required to conveniently construct the
core. A summary of the materials in the first criti-
cal assembly is given in Table 4.1. The aluminum,
which is a necessary structural material, is present
in the core as a vertical double sheet at the mid-
plane and in the reflector as fairly well-distributed
sheets and rods. The coating material, which con-
tained 31.8 wt % C, 61.9 wt % F, 5.5 wt % Cr, and
0.83 wt % H, was applied in a thin layer to the
uranivm metal to reduce oxidation. The Scotch
cellophane tape was used to hold the core sub-
assemblies together. A view of the mid-plane of
the reactor as initially assembled is shown in Fig.
4.1. The small rectangular holes below and to the
right of the core are the aluminum guide channels
for the control and safety rods.

that these calculations were in error because of
a numerical error in one of the ¢ross sections and
that the predicted critical mass range should have
been 20.9 to 22.75 Ib of U?33, The system was
made critical with 24.35 Ib of U?35 and had an
excess reactivity of approximately 7 cents, with
about 20% of the mid-plane aluminum plates omitted.
It has since been shown that the mounting of this
plate resulted in a reduction in reactivity of ap-
proximately 10 cents, and therefore the system as
designed and loaded with 24.35 |b was slightly
subcritical. Sufficient excess reactivity for sub-
sequent experiments has been gained by the addi-
tion of a cylindrical annulus of beryllium reflector
]7]/2 in. long and 27/8 in. wide with its axis perpen-
dicular to the mid-plane. This addition gave an
increase in reactivity of 65 cents, The extra
beryllium at the top of the reactor was removed
during flux measurements.

It was discovered, however,

Measurements of neutron flux have been made in
a vertical direction along a radius by using indium
foils with and without cadmium covers. The foils
are 10-mil aluminum-indium alloy, 5/16 in. in diame-
ter, having an effective indium thickness of 3 x
107 in., and the cadmium covers are 20 mils thick.
The results of these measurements are given in

of the some shape that will consist of three regions,
with the beryllium island and reflector separated
by the fuel annulus. The diameters of the beryilium
islond and the fuel annulus will be about 10.4 and

tained in stainless steel tubes distributed in on
organic liquid in a pattern designed 1o give a uni-
form radial thermal-neutron flux. The liquid, Furfural
(C5H402), which also serves as a neutron reflector
on the lateral surface of the cylindrical tube bundle,
has a hydrogen density opproximately the same as
that of water under the temperature and pressure
conditions designed for the SCWR. It simulates
the nuclear properties of supercritical water as
well as can be determined without further knowledge
of the effect of binding energies on diffusion and
slowing down lengths, Stainless steel was inserted
in the fuel tubes to represent the reactor structure.

The loading of the critical assembly was calcu-
lated by Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Division person-
nel,® by use of a four-group diffusion theory method,
to be 15.34 kg of U?3% and 261 kg of stainless
steel in o 76.2-cm equilateral right cylinder with a

fuel distribution is plotted in Fig. 4.4 as the smooth
curve and is compared to the stepwise distribution
achieved when aoll tubes are identically loaded,

In the experimental study, a quantity of UO,F,
aquecus solution, containing uranium enriched to
93.14% in U?3%, was distributed among the tubes
at a U23% concentration of 0.505 g/cm®. The
number of tubes required for criticality was meas-
sured as a function of the Furfural height as in-
creasing quontities of stainless steel were inserted
ond as the solution was diluted. In this manner a
stepwise opproach was made to a loading of uniform

0.30 \

concentration which would be critical at the de-
signed linear dimensions of both fuel solution and
Furfural and which would contain the prescribed
mass of stainless steel. These conditions have
not been achieved because the last dilution was
overestimated and a large part of the solution is at
a concentration somewhat lower than required for
criticality, a deficiency compensated for by locating
about 50 tubes of higher concentration fuel in one
peripheral section.

MATERIALS RESEARCH
5. CHEMISTRY OF MOLTEN MATERIALS

W. R. Grimes
Materials Chemistry Division

Studies of the NaF-ZrF -UF , system were initi-
ated after the solid phase studies in the NaF-ZrF,
system were completed, ond to date no ternary com-
pounds have been discovered in the NaF-ZrF -UF,
system, A tenfative equilibrium diagrom has been
prepared. The apparatus for visual observation of
melfing temperatures was used to observe eleven
NaF-UF, mixtures in the composition range 20 to
50 mole % UF ,, and a partial phase diagram of the
system was prepared. A new apparatus has been
constructed that will permit some manipulations to
be carried out with the fused salts in an inert
atmosphere.

Recent afttempts to correlate the anticipated re-
duction of UF, in the preparation of UF,-bearing
melts with wet chemical analysis for UF, and UF
and results of petrographic examination show some
surprising anomalies. When UF , dissolved in LiF,
in NaF-ZrF , mixtures, or in NaF LiF mixtures is
treated under flowing hydrogen at BO0°C with ex-
90% or more of the UF, is
reduced to UF,. However, when this techmque is
applied to UF, in NaF-KF-LiF mixtures, the re-
duction is only 50% complete at 800°C and, perhaps,
75% complete at 600°C. Petrographic exominations
of the specimens reveal no complex compounds of
tetravalent uranium; it is possible that the UF  is
“*hidden’’in solid solutions or in complex UF ;-UF,
compounds in which it is not at present recogniz-
able,

A method for the large-scale purification of
rubidium fluoride has been developed. All the
rubidium fluoride obtained from commetcial sup-
pliers to date has contained considerably more than
the specified quantity of cesium compounds, and
therefore almost all of it has been returned to the
vendors for further processing. The purification
method developed can be used at a reasonable cost

cesium cannot be obtained from commercial sources,

Values for the equilibrium constant for the re-
action

in molten NaZrF hove been re-examined by the use

of various ratios of UF:;/UF4 with chromium metal
in the charge., From the data obtained when this

initial ratio is less than 3, average values of
5 % 10-4 at 600°C and 6 x 10~% at 800°C can be
computed. At ratios larger than 3 the values in-
crease regularly; this rise is probably due to the
extreme difficulty in filtration and analysis of
samples containing 1 to 20 ppm of Cr**,  The
values at low UF /UF ratios agree quite weli
with the correspondmg vciues of 42 x 104
600°C and 4.1 x 1074 at 800°C obtained prevuously
when UF, and chromium metal were the charge
material.

Fundamental studies were made of the reduction
of NiF, and FeF, by H, in NaF-ZrF, systems as
a means of determining possible improvements in
purification techniques. Also, methods for pre-
poring simple fluorides were
studied. Additional measurements of decomposition
potentials of KCI and of various chlorides in molten
KCI at 850°C were made.

Preliminary measurements of the solubility of

Lorge quantities of purified ZrF -base fluorides

Since the consumption of NaF-ZrF, and NaF-

during the fiscal year, it is important to decrease
the cost of production of this material. The HF-H,
processing currently used is adequate from ali
points of view, but processing times of nearly
100 hr per batch are now required with the rela-
tively poor raw materials available. The sub-

thai the price of purified NaZrF . and NaF-ZrF -UF

It was assumed in the previous studies® of solu-
bility relationships for UF, in various fluoride
mixtures that in the presence of excess metallic
uranium or zirconium the uranium present in the
fused salt solution was trivalent. This assumption
seemed justified, since, for the reaction

Brewer's tabulation® of standard free energies of

AF® = =16 keal .

In addition, petragraphic exomination of the melts
obtained revealed the presence of red materiols
tentatively identified as complex compounds of
UF,, with green compounds of UF, showing only
in traces, if ot all. Since these observations were
those anticipated and since the petrographic ex-
aminations had previously been shown to be very
sensitive in detecting compounds of trivalent ure-
nium in systems which had been slightly reduced,
there seemed to be little reason fo believe that the
results of such examination might be unreliable,

During the past quarter, however, considerable evi-
dence has been accumulated by the most accurate
wet-chemical methods yet devised for determining
U3Y and U*" in fluoride mixtures which shows
that the reduction of UF, by excess uranivin metal
is not complete at B00°C. While the reduction in

NaF-ZrF, mixtures and in LiF appears to be 90%,
or more, complete, in such mixtures as NaF-KF-LiF
only about 50% of the UF, is reduced. Toward the
end of the quarter it became evident that severd
of the materials such as “3KF-2UF ;" previously
believed to contain only U®¥ regularly contained
large and varying quantities of U**. Furthermore,
the crystals containing variable quantities of U4*
are distinguishable as such only with great diffi-
culty, if at all, by petrographic and x-ray diffraction
examination, Consequently, the previously reported
data on the solubility of UF; in various systems
must be reinterpreted,

The reasons for the incomplete reduction of the
tetravalent uranium are not yet completely under-
stood, and it is not possible at present to define
the extent to which the reduction will proceed at
various temperatures aond in the various solvents,
Accordingly, the significance of much of the ma-
terial presented below is not completely known,

UF, in ZrF -Bearing Systems

The solubility of UF, in NaF-ZrF ; mixtures was

previously shown® to increase with increasing
temperature and with increasing Zrf, concentration
of the solvent over the range 47 to 57 mole % ZrF ,,
Since the publication of that information it has been
shown that the reduction of UF, in ZrF -bearing
melts by excess uranium metal is slightly less than
90% complete at 800°C, The temperature de-
pendence of the reduction is not yet known for
this system, but it is likely that the UF, is more
completely reduced at lower temperatures,

An examination of the NaF-ZrF -UF; system has
been ottempted by thermal analysis, with petro-
graphic examination of the resulting solid phases,
In these studies, UF:‘4 and excess uranium metal
are added to the desired NaF-ZrF ; mixiure before
the sample is heated, and the somple is stirred

Therefore

YUF, + hUe+— UF,

might be expected to reach its equilibrium value at
any temperature above the melting point. Conse-
quently, in contrast to experiments in which the
metallic uranium is removed by filtration af high
temperatures, the solid products in slowly cooled
melts might be expected to be nearly completely
reduced.

These studies indicate that UF, is the primary
phase in systems in which the NaF-to-ZrF , ratic is

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1954

less than 5 to 6 and that Na,U,F, appears as the
primary phase in systems in which the NaF-to-Z¢F
ratio is about 15, It also appears that Na,Zr F .,
crystals may contain small quantities of UF, in
solid solution. The solubility data obtained from
these ond previous studies give little reason to
expect that UF, can be dissolved in NaF-ZrF,
mixtures in sufficient amounts to provide fuel for
reflector-moderated reactors,

UF, in NaF-KF.LiF Mixtures
The solubility of UF, in the NaF-KF-LiF eutectic

was stated previously'? to be equivalent to at
least 15 wt % ot temperatures as low as 525°C,
Subsequent careful examination of this system has
revealed that when UF, and an excess of uranium
metal are added to the purified NaF-KF-LiF mixture
the dissolved uranium species aggregate at least
22% total uranium in the mixture. However, it is
obvious that only 40 to 45% of the soluble uranium
is present as UF; at 800°C, while 55 to 60% may be
trivalent at 600°C, Further study of the system will
be necessary before these values can be determined
more accurately,

Thermal analysis date have been obtained for
several mixtures which were prepared from UF , and
the NaF-KF-LiF eutectic and then treated with an
excess of uranium metal. The data obtained, as
shown in Table 5.2, are in agreement with the data
obtained from filtration studies which showed high
uranium concentrations at low temperatures. Petro-
graphic examination of these materialsreveoled that
at low uranium concentrations a red phase (refractive
index, about 1.44), which is probably I'(::,)UF:‘S and
which may contain UF ,, is predominant. At high

not known.

UF3 in NaF-RhF.LiF Mixtures

The previously reported!! data on the solubility
of UF, in the NaF-RbF-LiF eutectic composition
were based on the assumption that all the uranium
in the filtered specimens was UF ;. For more.recent
studies, the solubilities were determined by using
200-g samples of melt, mechanical agitation during
the equilibration period, and 20% excess uranium
for the reduction step. Samples of the equilibrium
mixture were withdrawn with a filter stick contain-
ing sintered nicke!l as the filter medium. The
samples were then analyzed for trivalent uranium
and for total uranium. The results of the analyses
are presented in Table 5.3.

 

VIR, J. Sheil and C. J. Barton, ANP Quar, Prog. Rep.
June 10, 1954, ORNL-1729, p 53,

The significance of the analyses for UF, is not
entirely clear, Petrographic examination of the
solidified filtrates indicated o reddish-brown ma-
terial, presumed to be RbyUF ., as the only colored
phase, While it is possible that this material could
accommodate UF, in solid solution, it deoes not
appear likely that as much as 75% of the total
uranium present could be hidden in this fashion,

The good agreement, for some of the mixtures
studied, between the theorstical uranium content
and the measured total uranium content indicates
that the reaction of UF, with uranium metal pro-
ceeded nearly to completion. Additional data on
this system will be needed before an interpretation
of the results can be presented.

UF3 in the Individual Alkali-Metal Fluorides

Filtered specimens from preparations in which
UF, dissolved in LiF was treated at 825 to 850°C
with excess uranium metal have shown that more
than 90% of the dissolved uranium is trivalent and
that it crystallizes as UF;.  Accordingly, it is
believed that the behavior observed by thermal
analysis of this system is that of LiF with pure,

UF, in Binary Alkali-Metal Fluoride Systems

A number of thermal analyses followed by petro-
graphic examination of the solid products have
been performed with UF, in each of the NaF-LiF,
NaF-KF, and LiF-KF eutectic mixiures. These
specimens were prepared, in each case, by reducing
the desired UF ,~alkali-metal fluoride mixture with
10% excess metallic uronium in nickel crucibles
blanketed with inert gas and fitted with stirrers of
nickel.

In the NaF-LiF system the lowest liquidus tem-
perature observed was at about 630°C at 10 mole %
UF; ond 36 mole % NaF, In all cases studied (up
to 30 mole % UF ;) only the free alkali-metal fluo-
rides ond the NaF-UF ; complex compound (Najl,F o)
were observed.

In the NaF-KF-UF; system the red compound
K3UF, appears as the only colored species in
mixtures containing up to 10 mole % UF,; the
optical properties are slightly different from those
of the compound crystallized fromNaF-free mixtures
and may indicate slight solid solution of NaF in
the crystals. Mixtures containing 20 to 40 mole %
UF; show increasing quantities of a blue phase
with optical properties which suggest that it is a
solid solution of NajU,Fg and K U, 1. Liquidus
temperatures in this system seem to be higher than
700°C in all cases.

Solutions of UF, in the LiF-KF binary system
show liquidus temperatures in the range 485 to
600°C. Petrographic examination of thesematerials
shows free LiF in all specimens, K,UF, in those
containing less than 10 mole % UF,, and K U, Fy
in those containing much above 10 mole % UF,,

Chemical analyses were not performed on any of
these materials, but it is likely thot considerable
UF , was present in these specimens, especially at
the higher temperotures. Additional studies of
these potentially valuable systems will be made,

PURIFICATION CF RUBIDIUM FLUORIDE

C. J. Barton, Materiols Chemisiry Division
D, L.. Stockton, ORSORT

All the rubidium fluoride cbtained from comimercial
suppliers to date has contained considerably more
than the specified quantity of cesium compounds,
and therefore almost all of it has been retumed to

60

the vendors for further processing. However, the
immediate need for small amounts of pure material
for phase equilibrium studies and for rubidium metadl
production has necessitated purification of some
material at ORNL.

Experiments '¢ have shown the feasibility of
separating rubidium from cesium with the ion ex-
change medium Amberlite IR-105, This resin was,
accordingly, used in all the experiments conducted,
The resin column consisted of a 3-in.,-dia glass
pipe containing a 6-ft bed of the resin. The column
was loaded for each run with about 350 g of crude
RbF known to contain about 20% CsF. Elution of
the rubidium was accomplished in about 35 liters of
0.5 M (NH ) ,CO,4 solution; the purity of the product
was not appreciably affected by elution rates in
the range 30 to 60 ml/min.

Elution of cesium from the column, which was
observed by use of Cs'37, required 65 to 70 liters
of the (NH,),CO, solution; elution was not greatly
improved by use of a 1.5 M solution. From a total
of 1775 g of crude RbF charged in five different
runs, somewhat more than 1 kg of RbF containing
less than 1% CsF was obtained. The KF content
(0.6% KF) was not appreciably affected by this
treatment.

It is apparent that this purification con

terials. During the past quarter, the values have
been checked with various ratios of UF4 to UF, as
starting materials in the NaZrF . solution. The
apparatus and details of the experimental technique
were the same as in previous experiments. The

It was necessary to calculate the final UF_ con-
centration, since accurate analyses for U3 in the
presence of Crtt could not be made; any error
arising from this calculation would be important
only at low UF; concentrations,

The data show that at both 600 and 800°C the

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1954

values of K _ remain constant at low UF 5-to-UF
ratios but increase rapidly as this ratio rises above
3. This rapid increase in K may be due to in-
complete removal by filtration of small amounts of
chromium metal or to uncertainties in analysis of
these frace quantities. Since, as shown above, the
UF ;-to-UF, ratio in NaZrF . solution in equilibrium
with uranium metal is about 9 at 800°C, it is not
likely that disproportionation of the UF, is re-
sponsible for the increase in K .

In any case, the agreement between the meon of
four values of the constant ot each temperature
with previously published values is extremely good.
Agreement among the various initial Uf""?;i'o:«U[':4

600°C (1 x 10=7) agrees with the previously re-

do not agree well with the value of 1.5 x 10~

In on ottempt to explain this discrepancy, the

that the reoction of ferrous metal with UF, had
not reached equilibrium in the reaction time allowed.

J. D. Redman C. F. Weaver
Materials Chemistry Division

It was shown in previous experiments that CrfF,
or some complex compound of divalent chromium
was the corrosion product in the ZrF4ubuse fluoride
melts of interest., However, when NoF-KF-LiF
mixtures, with and without UF . were tested in
equipment prepared from olloys containing chromium,
the reaction products found were complex com-
pounds of CrF . Since films that were apparently
NaK,CrF . or similar materials have been observed
in some experiments, attempts have been made to
observe the stability ond solubility of CrF, and
CrF, in typical salt mixtures of the two fypes.

In the temperature range 600 to 800°C, CrF, is
not stable in NaZrF. solution in contact with
equipment of nickel. Examination of filtered speci-
mens shows that the reaction

ECrFB + Ni&=—= NEF2 + 2CrF2
The solubility
of CrF, in the NaZrF g solvent seems fo exceed
6000 parts of Cr per million parts of salt at 600°C;
solubility ot 800°C seems to be at least 15,000 ppm
and may be considerably higher,

In the NaF-KF-LiF system it appears that CrF,

Whether the disproportionation re~

from the data available, It appears from preliminary
evidence, however, that the solubility of Cr3% is
several thousand parts per million at 600°C,

Reduction of NiF, by H, in NaF.ZrF, Systems

C. M, Blood H. A, Friedman
G. M, Watson
Materials Chemistry Division

The use of hydrogen as a reducing agent in the
removal of oxidizing impurities from fluoride melts
has been routine for almost two years. One of the
principal impurities removed is the Ni** introduced
as a result of treating the melts with hydrogen
fluoride in nickel containers at 800°C. Since
hydrogen was first employed in this fashion, kinetic
studies have been under way in order to supply data
on which improved fluoride production procedures

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1954

could be based, The Ni*" was found to reduce so
rapidly thot the controlling step was the rate of
removal of hydrogen fluoride from the melt; hence
the chemistry of the process presents no problem of
consequence from an engineering standpoint. With
the completion of measurements af 800°C during the
pust quarter, these studies have been discontinued,

The experimental method used for the measure-
ments at 800°C was the same as that used in
previously described experiments ot 600 and
700°C.'8  Figure 5.5 shows a comparison of the
effect of temperature on the rates of reduction for
four concentrations. The slopes of the curves show
that the apparent activation energy for the rate de-
termining step is about 7800 cal. This energy of
activation is in accord with the hypothesis that
the reaction is heterogeneocus and is catalyzed by
nickel surfaces.

The data presented here were all obtcined at
roughly the same gas flow rate (100 mi/min).
However, since the rate of reduction is dependent
on the flow rate and on the geomeiry of the appo-
ratus, the results must be considered merely as
representative and are subject to some voriation
with conditions; they apply to 3-kg batches in
4.in,-dia pots with hydrogen bubbles rising from
the notched end of a ]/4-in. vertical dip tube im-
mersed to a depth of 5 in.

in which the ratio of HF concentration at a given
flow rate to that found at a standard flow rate (210

pated, the ratio drops at high flow rates; however,
the ratic shows no sign of leveling off at low flow
rates, as would be expected. Although the curve
shows no justification for the practice, the lowest
flow rate found to be practicable (9 ml/min) was
considered to be equivalent to a zero flow rate
(thot is, the flow rate at which the HF concen-
tration could be expected to be at equilibrium),
and experimental values found in subsequent ex-
periments were corrected to the concentration that
they would have shown at such flow rate,

The experiments were performed by adding known

melt in a clean nickel reactor and measuring the HF
concentration of the effluent hydrogen passed at
carefully measured flow rates. The cumulative
total of HF removed was also determined by col-

of the excess caustic, The Fel, concentration at
any specified time could be calculated from the

periment and the HF yield after the specified time,

capable of high internal precision, yielded the
values plotted as the lower curve in Fig, 3.7. The
logarithm &f the HF concentration is plotted against

Equilibration Method, Since it was doubtful that
the lowest flow rate found to be practicable (9

librium conditions directly. A mixture of HF and
H, was bubbled through a melt containing Fe® and
FeF, until the influent HF concentration matched

66

that of the effluent. At that time a sample was
drawn through a sintered nickel filter ond analyzed
to determine the FeF, concentration,

Since the decomposition pressures of molten
KF-HF saturated with KF depend only on tempera-
ture, 19 definite mixtures of H2 and HF could be
obtained while hydrogen gas was passed over such
mixtures held ot a constant temperature. The
mixtures of H, thus obtained were used as influent
for the reactor containing the salt mixture,

In a typical experiment in which this method was
used, a batch (~3 kg) of previously purified NaF-
ZrF4 (53-47 mole %) mixiure was loaded into g
clean nickel reactor. The mixture was heated to
800°C and further purified with hydrogen until a
very low HF concentration (3 x 10~ mole/liter)
in the effluent gas denoted high purity of the melt.
The mixture was allowed to cool to rocom tempera-
ture, and FeF , and iron wire were added to the cold,
frozen mixture under an atmosphere of argon. The
mixture was then heated, melted, and brought up to
temperature while it was sparged with helium gas.
The reactor containing the KF«HF or HF generator
was heated separately to a convenient initic!

reacters — the HF generator and the equilibration
reactor — in order to clean out any NiF. films on
walls and to precipitate nickel impurities. After

connected in series, ond the inlet and effluent
gas streams were continuously sampled and ana-
lyzed.  The temperature of the furnace of the
generator was then adjusted until the analyzer

The gas mixture was allowed to bubble through the
system for extended periods of time, and somples
were taken intermittently for onalysis. When it was
considered that the system had approached equi-
librium, as indicated by a convergence of the in-
fluent and effluent compositions, the HF generator
was removed from the system and helium wos sub-
stituted for the influent gas mixture. A filtering
tube was introduced into the melt under an addi-
tional argon atmosphere and o filtrate was obtained,
The filtering tube with the frozen filtrate was re-
moved ond analyzed for iron, This procedure was
repeated with appropriate variation of the tempera-
ture of the HF generator and consequent variation
of the influent gas composition,

are less precise than those obtained by the dynamic

to the more complex apparatus and technique. How-

Preparation of Various Fluorides

B, J. Sturm E. E. Ketchen

Materials Chemistry Division

The simple structural metal fluorides have con-
tinued to be used extensively for numerous pur-
poses. A limited interest also has been maintained
in several of the complex fluorides formed by the
interaction of alkali fluorides with structural metal
fluorides. Some effort also has been expended on
the preparation of other simple fluorides, as well as
on the purification of small quantities of the struc-
tural metal fluorides. The identity and purity of
these fluorides have been established mainly by
chemical analysis supplemented by x-ray and petro-
graphic data in some cases.

The compound AgF, with an Ag-to-F ratio of

0.98, was prepared by heating Ag,CO, under HF

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1954

at 150 to 200°C, An attempt to prepare AgF by
reacting HF with AgCN was unsuccessful; most of
the AgCN did not react. Several batches of an-
hydrous ZnF, were prepared by heating ZnF »4H.,0
under HF at 600°C., The compound TeF, was
prepared by reacting Te and HN03 and reacting the
resulting TeO , with aqueous HF 1o give TeO,F ,-H 0,
which was thermally decomposed to vyield T'eOZ,
HF, H,0, ond the product TeF,. The TeF, wos
collected in a condenser held at 130 to 140°C,

Small quantities of Rb,CrF . and Li,RbCrF  were
prepared by heating the proper quantities of CrF
RbF, and LiF in sealed capsules at 900°C. The
Rb3CrF6 has properties approximating those of o
corrosion product found in a rubidium-base fuel.
The compound RbCrF, was prepared by heating
CrF, and RbF at 800°C in a sedled capsule.
Numerous batches of structural metal fuel- or
coolant-type fluoride complexes were prepared.
Among these (prepared by methods previously
described) were: K,CrF,, K,NiF,, and KNiF,.

The compounds NiF_, FeF,, and FeF, were pre-
pared in a high state of purity by hydrofluorination
of the corresponding chlorides,

Additional measurements of decomposition poten-

KCl ot 850°C were muade. Morgonite (A1,0,)
crucibles were employed with all the melts studied.
Platinum and nickel were used as cathodes, and
the anodes were of nickel, carbon (graphite),
chromium, and zirconium.

The solutions of various chlorides in KCl were
prepared by melting 2 moles of KCI with 1 mole of
the anhydrous chloride in a sealed, evacuated

adding appropriate quantities of KCl to the 33.3%
KCl mixtures so obtained. The data obtained

The NiCl, solutions, as far as is known, undergo
the same electrochemical reactions regardless of
concentration. Thus the changes in decomposition
potential with concentration may be assigned to
differences in NiCl, activity alone, With the aid
of the Nernst equation, the NiCl, activity at 33.3
mole % NiCl, may be computed to be 100 times that
in the 3.3 mole % solution and 300 times that in
the 1 mole % solution.

Solubility of Xeaon in Molten Salts

R. F. Newton, Research Director’'s Department
D. G. Hill, Consultant

The use of molten salts as reactor fuels offers
the possibility of removing the gaseous fission-
product poisons, of which zenon is the most im-
portant. {f, for exomiple, the xenon concentration of
the 60-Mw CFRE can be held at 10% of its equi-
librium value (1.1 x 1078 mole of xencn per milli-
liter of fuel), important perturbations in reactivity
can be avoided. In on circraft reactor, however,
it will be necessary to effect this removal of xenon
with an absclute minimum of auxiliary eguipment.

The available literature appears to contfain no
measurements of the solubility of gases in molten
salts.  Accordingly, it haos seemed desirable to
evaluate the solubility of xenon in molten fluorides
over the temperature range of interest, Preliminary
tests indicate that the following experimental tech-
nique is satisfactory.

The apparatus, which is constiucted of nicke!
where it will be in contact with the fluoride melt
and of glass elsewhere, consists of two sections
that can be isolated by freezing a plug of fluoride
in the U-tube connecting them,
the apparatus the melt is allowed to saturate with

xenon under predetermined conditions of tempera-
ture and pressure. Melting of the fluoride plug

plug isolates the sections again.

circulation of the hydrogen contained in the appa-
ratus through the solt and past a liquid-nitrogen-
cooled irap. After the stripping process is com-
plete, the hydrogen is removed, the xenon is allowed

to come to room ftemperature, and the amount col-

lected is ascertained by measurements in a modi-
fied Mcleod gage.

Preliminary experiments at 600°C ond essentially
1 atm of xenon indicate that the solubility in the
NaF-KF-LiF eutectic is not greater than 107
mole of xenon per milliliter of salt, The method and
technique proved to be feasible, but minor experi-
mental  difficulties necessitated modification of
the nickel apparatus. More accurate data under
these and other conditions will be available in the
neor future,

Meanwhile, in order to gain familiarity with the
technique, the solubility of xenon in the KNO,-
NGNOB eutectic (66 mole % NQNO3) has been
measured in an apparaius consiructed entirely of
glass. The solubility of xenon in this melt is
about 8.5 x 1078 mole/ml at 280°C and 10-7
mole/ml at 360°C. This liquid apparently shows
the positive temperature coefficient of solubility
expected for gases in molten salts,

of the liquid density?7 of NaF-ZrF , (50-50 mole %)
meosured ot above 600°C 1o 520°C, a value of
3.32 g/em® for the liquid is obtained, An adjust-
ment of this to the composition of NaF-ZrF , (53-47
mole %), by assuming an almost constant molar
volume, lowers the density to approximately 3.2
g/em?. Thus a relatively large density and volume
change of 26% is indicated for this complex salt
on melting. The volume increase may be considered
as indicative of a decrease in ionic coordination
in the fused state similor to that observed in the
CsBr and Csl salts,

The ionic coordination in the solid is assumed to
be similar to that in NoUF ., for which Zachariasen
proposed a ftluorite type of packing with equal
coordinations for both the Na¥ and Zrit of the
order of 8 or 9. It seems possible that the volume
increase on melting results from a lowering in the
coordination of the fluorines around Zr?*, which
might also be considered as radical ion formation
around zirconium; this point requires further study.

the central portion of a large melt of NaF-ZrF
(53-47 wmole %) have become available, Single-
crystal x-ray analysis has been initigted in an

The most important contaminants of fluoride
melts (HF, Fef,, and NiF,) can be removed by
treatment of the melt with hydrogen, but this proc-
ess requires long periods for nearly complete re-
moval of the FeF,. Attempts have therefore been
made to demonstrate the effectiveness of zirconium
metal in removing these impurities in a short time,

In NaF.Z¢F, Mixtures. Known concentrations of
contaminants were added to 3.5-kg batches of pre-
viously purified NaF-ZrF, (53-47 mole %) in nickel
containers and allowed to remain overnight at
800°C in contact with a considerable excess of
metallic zirconium (30 g); some stirring was assurad
by continuous sparging with helium, No experi-
mental difficulties were observed either in equili-
bration or in filtration of the product,

In one experiment, the 10 g of Fel", added gave
an initial contaminant concentration of 1700 ppm
Fe. After treatment, the contaminants present in
the filtrate were 70 ppm Fe, 15 ppm Ni, and 15 ppm
Cr. In a second experiment, 9 g of CrF2 was added
to give an initial contaminant concentration of 1650
ppm Cr. The contaminants found in the filtrate in
this case were 90 ppm Fe, 25 ppm Ni, and 15 ppm
Cr. Thus these experiments indicate that the zir-
conium metal addition is on effective means of
preparing pure NaF-ZrF , mixtures,

In NoF-KF-iLiF Mixtures. The purity of several
2-kg batches of NaF-KF-LiF eutectic after treat-
ment with hydrogen and with zirconium metal ot

scavenging with metallic zirconium can be sub-
stituted for most, if not all, of the time-consuming
hydrogen stripping process. Since the impurities in
fluoride melts are initially present in low concen-
trations, it is anficipated that the small amount of

Purification of NaF-ZrF , Mixtures by Electrolysis

C. M. Blood H., A, Friedman
F. P. Boody F. W Miles
G. M. Watson
Materials Chemistry Division

In the effort to obtain improved fuel purification
procedures it was shown that electrolysis in NakF-
ZrF, melts ot 800°C with graphite anodes and
nickel cathodes reduces dissolved iron and nickel
to relatively low concentration in a much shorter
time than is required for the customary reduction
with hydrogen. Furthermore, the reduced impurities
were collected on a removable cathode that could
easily be withdrawn from pots with welded lids.
This feature promises to be of marked advantage in
processing large batches in equipment of a current
design which ollows the reduced metal from each
batch to recontaminate subsequent batches and
thereby multiply the amount of reduction required.

Careful attention was given to current-voltage
curves at all stages during the electrolysis in the
hope that “‘brecks'’ and apparent decomposition
potentials would permit the progress of the reduc-
tion to be followed. Filtered samples were removed
during various stages and anq]yzed for iron and
nickel to determine the actual amount present, To
facilitate analysis of the current-voltage curves, the
electrolysis pot waos fitted with “floating”’ anode
and cathode probes, which were used to determine

the potential between the melt and the ‘‘working’’
anode or cathode. The probes were made of I/8-in.
nickel rod; their potentials with respect to each
other and to both electrodes were followed through
many cycles of increasing and decreasing applied
voltage, but the results have not been completely
interpreted, ' :

J. A, Mcl.aren of the Chemical Technol‘ogy
Division is of the opinion that measurements with
the reference electrodes have shown that the depo-
sition of iron takes place with very little over-
voltage, At a current of 1 amp, iron was deposited
with a difference of potential between the cathode
and the nickel reference electrode of only 15 mv.
After depletion of the iron, the cathode potential
increased to 75 mv,

The anode potential was found to have a marked
discontinuity in the graph of current density and
voltage, At some critical current density the anode
voltage would increase suddenly. At the beginning
of the electrolysis the jump was found only at high
current densities, but as electrolysis continued,
it was found at lower current densities. The anode
jump was on the order of 0.2 to 2 v, an order of
magnitude greater than the increase found on the
cathode.

All the electrolyses were carried out in NaF-
ZrF, (47-53 mole %) mixtures in nickel containers,
The electrodes were suspended from the lid of a
3-kg capacity purification readtor (4 x 17 in.) with
modified spark plugs as insulating connectors; the
electrodes were immersed fo a depth of about 4 in.
The anode was o I/2-in.-dim C-18 graphite bar

ammeters, and a recording ampere-hour meter.

In the first experiments the nickel container was
used as the cathode, and helium gas was continu-
ously bubbled through the melt in order to stir and
to remove gaseous electrode products., The melt
was first thoroughly purified by a conventional HF
treatment followed by reduction with hydrogen.
Then current-voltage curves were token before and
after the addition of 1980 ppm Fe*" as FeF,. The
effect of the added impurity was readily noticeable.
The purified melt gave a curve like plot D of
Fig. 5.9, while the FeF ,-contaminated melt yielded
a curve similar to plot A, Extrapolation of the
curve obtained from the FeF ,-bearing melt gave «
decomposition potential of 0.9 v.

An elecirolyzing current of 5 amp was employed,
but numerous current-voltage curves were also
obtained so that at the end of 5 hr, 20.9 amp-hr had
passed. This was approximately twice the theo-
retical ampere-hours required to reduce the Fe'?;
a sample removed at this time analyzed 50 ppm Fe
and demonstrated that a fairly complete reduction
had been achieved with at least 50% current effi-
ciency. No evolution of fluorine was noted, nor
was there an appreciable attack on the nickel con-
tainer. The wall which had been in contact with
the vapor appeared to be covered with a fine dust,
presumably Nif .

FFor the next series of experiments o new batch
of freshly purified melt was used, hydrogen was
substituted for helium, and a current of 10 omp was
passed. Three purifications were carried out in
succession with addition of FeF, and NiF, to
simulate impurities, as shown in the first part of
Table 5.12. Apparent current efficiencies based on

data from Table 5.12 are deceptive because some
of the reduction is accomplished by hydrogen, which
gives high values, and also becouse the current
efficiency for purification becomes very low when
the amount of impurity to be reduced is very small,
When the container was used as a cathode, 6 v was
the maximum applied potential required to obtain a
current of 10 amp. An HF concentration in the
effluent gas of about 1073 mole of HF per liter of
hydrogen was noted at 5 amp.

In another series of experiments a removable
cathode, insulated from the pot, was used. The
cathode was a %8 x 4 in, cylinder of nickel gauze
welded to a .I/B-in, nickel rod; the gavze was made
of 15-mil wire, 25 wires to the inch. The dimen-
sions were chosen to be in the correct proportion
for a small-scale model of a 250-1b capacity pro-
duction reactor. To obtain a relatively high level of
initial impurity, approximately 20 g of FeF, and
20 g of NiF , were mixed with the starting materials.
After the usual HF treatment before electrolysis,
a sample was removed to determine the iron con-
centration, The results of the trial are summarized
in the second part of Table 5.12.

At the end of 12.5 amp-hr the cathode was re-
moved; it had gained 10.3 g of metallic iron (as
computed from chemical analysis), representing a
97% yield, A new cathode was then used until a
total of 37 amp-hr had passed; this cathode gained
0.2 g of iron, and thus the percentage recovery
had been increased to 99%. A current of 10 amp
gave current densities of 117 amp/cm? of anode
surface. By doubling the nominal area of gauze
used as the cathode to obtain the total surface
area both inside and out, the current density at the

The conclusion was reached that electrolysis
with removable cathodes was a practical and effi-
cient means of purifying fluoride melts containing
structural metal impurities, Experiments to investi-
gate the removal of sulfates and oxides by elec-
trolysis and an attempt to electrolytically reduce
UF, to UF 5 are in progress.

A typical set of current-voltage curves is shown
in Fig. 5.9. These curves opply to the experiment

Preparation of UF ,-Bearing Fuels

Materials Chemistry Division

Since preliminary results have shown that UF -
bearing fuels are less corrosive to Inconel than
UF ,-bearing fuels, considerable effort has been
devoted to studying methods for preparing these
materials, The experiments . performed thus far
have given results that ore not as yet well under-
stood. :

The tabulated values for standard free energy of
formation indicate that at 800°C the reaction

%U° + JUF ==UF,, AF° = ~16 kcdl,

should proceed to essential completion if the com-
pounds are in their standard states. There is ample
evidence that UF, dissolved in NaZrF is more
stable to re_ductlon by chromium than would be
expected,” but the difference between the expected
and the actual stability is hardly sufficient to
suggest that reduction of UF, by uranium meiul
should be detectably mcomple’re.

The reduction of UF, to UF; with uranium or
zirconium metal has been attemp’red in a lorge
number of préparations by the following technique.
About 500 g of material containing the predetermined
quantity of UF:4 is treated with HF and H, in nickel
equipment in the usual fashion to render it essen-
tially free from contaminants. This purified mixture
is cooled below the melting point, ond the desired
quantity of uranium or zirconium metal turnings éis
added, The reaction is allowed to proceed while
the mixture in the reactor is stirred by a stream of
hydrogen bubbling through it. Samples of the melt
can be obtained by drawing a sample into a filter
stick of nickel containing a sintered-nickei filter
medium. The specimens removed from the filter
stick are available for petrographic, x-ray, and wet
chemical examination.

The data obtained from seveml preparations are
presented in Table 5.13. It is obvious that com-
plete reduction was not obtained in any preparation
and that reduction in the NaF-KF-LiF system was
much less complete than in the other solvents,
While the number of experiments performed to date
may be too small to establish reliable frends, the
following pertinent observations can be made on
the basis of examination of these experiments and
results, '

No alkali metal was observed under the operating

UF, in Molten LiF. More than 90% of the UF in
mol’ren LiF wos reduced in each case, but complete
reduction was not accomplished. It is not possible
to say whether the difference between 0.96 at
825°C and 0.91 at 850°C is real. No alkali metal
vapor was detected. Petrographic examination
detected the presence of small quantities of UF4.

UF, in Molten NaF-KF-LiF. In five experiments
at 780 to 800°C the maximum reduchon obtained in
NaF-KF-LiF was 48% of that expected. The extent
of reduction was only slightly affected by an in-
crease in the reducing agent from 92 to 121% and
by an increase in the reaction time from 3 to 52 hr,
At lower equilibration temperatures the extenf of
reduction was increased. The highest value was
obtained at the shortest equilibration time and w:fh
the largest excess of reducing agent.

In all the experiments ot 780 to 80C°C, aikah
metal vapor was evident; however, at 600°C no
alkali vapor was observed. "It is possible that a
part of the difficulty in obtaining complete reduction
is due to reactions of the type

the metallic potassium being relatively

is responsible. However, it is especially difficult
to see why this reaction should be more important
in on NaF-KF-LiF solution than in an LiF solution.

the eight experiments with NaF-KF-LiF solution

The alkali-matal fluoride processing facility com-

ment of suitable processes for the production of

alkali-metal  fluoride mixivies containing UF,,

There have beon severa! preparstions, however, of
special batches of other compositions to fulfill

specific needa.  Single batches of approximately
2.5 kg caon be prepared in this equipment, During
the quarter, 27 preparations that yielded about 70 kg
of material were maode.

Repeated attempts to prepare NaF-KF-LiF mix-
tures containing 14 wt % UF,.ond 1 wt % UF, by
reduction of UF, with uranium metal yielded mix-
tures containing 3 fo 7 wt % UF, by chemical
analysis. These results, along with those reported
elsewhere in this document, seem to show that in
systems containing KF, reduction of UF, by urc-
nium metal is markedly incomplete. Pending clari-
fication of this point, production of material con-
taining 3 wt % UF ; and 10 wt % UF is under way,

the gas inlet tubes plugged quite frequently and
the HF concentration in the exit hydrogen feli
much below the value obtained at lower flow rates.
The over-all purification time was not appreciably
shortened by the fourfold ‘increase in hydrogen
passed.

Sublimation of crude ZrF , at a temperature lower
than that previously used by Y-12 personnel did
not appreciably improve the purity of the ZrF,
product. Accordingly, the NaF-ZrF , melts produced
future will be prepared from the
(NaF) .ZcF, that is available in moderately pure
form from o commercial source; hafnium-free ZeF,
will be used to adjust the composition as required,
since this material is available in a high state of

purity.

Electrolytic purification of NeF-ZrF, mixtures
has been shown to be complete, and the process
requires much less time than does the hydrogen
stripping process. Accordingly, one of the units
in the production facility is being modified slightly
to test this method on a large scale. It is antici-
pated that the use of the purer raw materials and
the electrolytic purification process will consider-
ably decrease the cost of fuel preparation.

The first in-pile loop was loaded on June 11 with
a fuel concenirate, NaF-ZrF ,-UF, (62.5-12.5-25.0
mole %), prepared from enriched uranium by Y-12
personnel.  The looding apparatus and controls
performed satisfactorily, and the transfer of ma-
terial to the loop went smoothly. However, the
electrical contact which should have indicated
when the loop was filled to operating level was
not octivated even after 120% of the caiculated
charge had been added. _ |

Subsequent examination of the loop showed that
a weld had given way where the loop was connected
to the pump bowl, and it seems certain that this
leak was present during the filling operation. The

of the filling apparatus revealed that all but 68 g

Work has been continued on the reaction of copper

ported33 on copper concentrations found in NoOH
up to 800°C, A recent determination at 900°C
shows 2500 ppm Cu in the melt after exposure.
This value is higher than would be expected from
the previous data taken from 600 to 800°C, A plot
of log Cu concentration vs 1/T yields a siraight
line from 600 to BO0O°C and thus suggests that true

this line would give a value of about 1500 ppm

The static and seesaw corrosion testing facilities
were used for further studies of brazing olloys,
special Stellite heats, Hastelloy R, Inconel, graph-
ite, and various ceramics in sodium, fluoride fuel
mixtures, and other mediums. For the fabrication
of many reactor components it may be well to have
a brazing alloy that is compatible both with sodium
and with the fluoride fuels. Therefore several cor-
rosion tests were performed on Inconel joints brazed
with high-temperature brazing alloys. From this
work it was found that the brazing alloy 67% Ni~13%
Ge-11% Cr—-6% Si-2% Fe—1% Mn has good cor-
rosion resistance in fluoride fuels and fair corrosion
resistance in sodium. Two special heats of Stellite
were tested that had a lower carbon content than
those tested previously, and it was found that the
fower carbon content increased the corrosion
resistance in the fluoride fuels. '

High-density graphite was tested in sodium and
in fluoride mixtures; it has very poor resistance to
sodium attack but seems to have fair resistance to
the fluoride fuels. Various hard-facing materials,
ceramics and cermets, have been investigated from
the corrosion standpoint for use as bearings, seals,
and valve seats; Al,0,, MgAl,O,, ZrO,, and SiC
were fested in sodium, a fluoride fuel, lithiom, and
lead. In these tests, SiC showed the best corrosion
resistance.

in the thermal-convection loop corrosion studies,
emphasis has shifted to fuels with the uranium
present os UF3 and to loops of Hastelloy B, Hot-
leg attack is not found in Inconel loops in which
ZrF ,-base fluoride mixtures with the uranium as
UF, are circulated. A deposit is, however, found
on the hot-leg surface. Only preliminary information
is available, but it appears that neither attack nor
a hot-leg layer is found with alkali-metal-base fluo-
ride mixtures containing UF,. Mixtures of UF, and
UF, will result in a reduction in attack from that
found with only UF ,, but some attack is present
and in high-uranium-content systems it may be
significant,

The addition of zirconium hydride to the ZrF -
base fuel mixtures containing UF4 was found to

result in the formation of UF, and in a reduction
in corrosion. However, to obtain a complete ab-
sence of corrosion, sufficient hydride must be
added fo cause a loss of uranium,

Several Hastelloy B loops have now been suc-
cessfully operated in both the as-received and the
over-aged conditions. inboth cases, a considerable
increase in hardness occurs during operation, With
ZcF ,-bose ‘mixtures containing UF,, very little
attack is found, even after 1000 hr.

The mass transfer characteristics of type 316
stainless steel in molten lithium were studied by
using thermal-convection loops. After 1000 hr of
loop operation, there was no sign of plug formation,
and only a small amount of mass transfer was found
in one of the loops. The investigation of the cor-
rosion and mass transfer characteristics of materials
in contact with liquid iead has shown that certain
alloys possess a much greater resistonce to mass
transfer than the pure components of those alloys.
The probable reason for this resistance to mass
transfer con be related to the formation of inter-
metallic compounds in these alloys, This has been
proved in the case of alloys of 45% Cr-55% Co,
Ni-Mo alloys, and the Fe-Cr-base stainless steels,

The flammability of liquid sodium glloys has
been studied, and it has been found that only bis-
muth and mercury have an effect on the flammability
of sodium. It was found that the degree of reaction
of Na-Bi and Na-Hg alloys with air was not signifi-
cantly changed when the pressure was varied from
0.25 to 1 atm. An investigation has been started to
determine the amount of hydrogen liberated when
NaOH is heated to 900°C in an inert environment,
The container problem has been solved by using a
large single crystal of magnesium oxide. A thermo-
dynamic study of the alkali-metal hydroxides has
shown that hydrogen is important in stabilizing
NaQH at temperatures above 800°C, This is the
temperature range at which moss transfer becomes
significant in Ni-NaOH systems. These computa-
tions link the formation of hydrogen with the forma-
tion of unsaturated oxygen ions, which may be
necessary for moss transfer to occur.

ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

A plausible explanation has been developed for
the evidence of a maximum in the corrosion of In-
conel by molten fluorides in static tests at 800 to
900°C and for both void formation and chromium
concentration in the melt being less at 1000°C than
at B00°C. Static tests of type 316 stainless steel
in NaZrF ¢ and in NaF-ZrF ,-UF , substantiated the

phenomena observed with Inconel.

Additional corrosion experiments with fuel mix-
tures containing simulated fission products have
shown that the experimental procedure being fol-
lowed is entirely unsatisfactory. A controlled-
velocity corrosion testing apparatus has been con-
structed for the rapid transfer of mclten fluoride
mixtures through both heated and cooled test sec-
tions. This apparatus was designed to simulate
conditions in reactor components.

on alloy A is not serious, since sodium would be
in contact with this alloy enly in the event of a
tube-to-header weld fracture. It may be concluded
from the results of these tests that further study is
warranted on alloys A and B; both showed good re-
sistance to attack by the fluoride mixture. Special
emphasis will be placed on alloy A, since it
exhibited superior resistance to attack by sodium,

Two special heats of Stellite, heats B and C,
were requested from the Union Carbide and Carbon
Metals Research Laboeratories for corrosion testing.
The specimens were sand cast and had Rockwell
C hardnesses as follows: heat B, 39 to 42; heat C,
42 to 43. The as-received microstructure consisted
of Cr,C, corbide particles in a cobalt-rich matrix.
The approximate compositions of these heats were

was perpendicular to the surface.

None of the specimens were attacked in Sodxum
however, in heat B there were no large equiaxed
carbide pamcles in a 1- to 2-mil area adjacent to
the surface. The carbide particles in this area ap-
peared to have transformed to a very fine structure.
There was also a large amount of fine precipitate
in the cobalt-rich matrix near the surface. 4

Heat C had slightly better resistance than heat B
to attack by sodium, and both heats had very poor
resistance to attack by the fluoride mixture. Several
of the specimens had shrinkage veoids near the
surface, one that was 7 mils in diameter, and the
attack was deeper in these areas. |

The specimens showed good resistance to attack
by I‘«lc:l':-ZrF“-UF‘ﬁi (50-46-4 mole %), Fig. 6.7, and
by lithium. Surprisingly, this alloy had better re-
sistance to attack by lithium than by sodium; the
attack by lithivm on high-nickel-content alloys (for
example, Inconel) at 1500°F is usually heavy and
is greater thon the attack by sodium. The sample
tested in sodium was attacked slightly, while the
specimen tested in lead was heavily attacked. The
specimen tested in sodium hydroxide was attacked
throughout its entire thickness.

Inzone! in Melten Rubidium

Tests were conducted on rubidium metal in con-
nection with an ORSORT project. Rubidium has a
low melting point, 92°F, and a low boiling point,
1270°F, and therefore is being considered as a
possible reactor coolant. The rubidium metal used
in the experiments was prepared by calcium re-
duction of the rubidium fluoride salt by the Stable
Isotope Research and Production Division,

An initial attempt to determine the vapor pressure
vs temperature relationship up to 1650°C was un-
successful. However, the test equipment has been
redesigned and another attempt will be made in the
near future, lnconel has been tested in contact
with static rubidium for 100 hr ot 1650°F, The at-
tack varied from 0.5 mil in the vapor zone to a
maximum of 1.5 mils at the liquid-gas interface, as
shown in Fig. 6.8. The rubidium used was not dis-
tilled and is known to have contained several per

Carhunzahon of Inconel by Sodium

it is well known that sodium, in addition to de-
carburizing metals, can, in some cases, carburize
them if the carbon concentration in the sodium is
sufficiently high.. Therefore, an attempt is being
made to determine whether small additions of carbon
- would prevent decarburization of Inconel specimens
during long-time creep tests in contact with sodium
at elevated temperatures. A-nickel containers are
being used for static tests ‘so that the ratio of
inconel surface area to sodium volume will be
small. The maximum solubility of carbon in nickel

ot 1500°F is approximately ;0.]%_, and therefore the
carburization of the nickel containers in these
tests is very slight. The A-nickel used for the
containers was found by analysis to contain only

0.05% carbon.

The ratio of the Inconel surface to the sodium
volume in. the tests performed to date was 0.76.
The Inconel specimens used were 0.049-in. sheet
reduced to 0.015 in. by cold rolling, and they were
annealed for 2 hr at 1650°F, The carbon additions
(1, 5, and 10 wt %) were made to the sodium in the
form of small lumps of reactor-grade graphite. :

The nickel containers were loaded with the In-
conel specimens, the grophite, ond the sodium in a
dry box in a purified helium atmosphere ond sealed
under vacuum. As shown in Table 6.4 and Fig.
6.10, all the specimens were very heavily carburized
and extremely brittle after exposure for 100 hr at
1500°F. . Also, they were partly covered v{rith a

other tests with degassed grophite and standard
tests with no graphite addition. Therefore prepa-

Special Tar-Impregnated and Fired Graphite

A special tar-impregnated and fired graphite,
known commercially as Graph-i-tite, has been tested
for corrosion resistance to sodium and NaF-ZrF -
UF, (53.5-40-6.5 mole %). Also, a comparison was
made of the carburization of an austenitic stainless
steel by contact with Graph-j-tite and with C-18
graphite (reactor grade). The Graph-i-tite was
fabricated, as described previously,! by tar-impreg-
nating and firing graphite 16 times. The repeated
tar impregnations and firings produce a high density

An open Graph-i-tite crucible containing sodium
and a sealed Graph-i-tite crucible containing NaF-
ZrF ,-UF were tested at 1500°F for 100 hr in
vacusm. The sodium completely penetrated the
0.38-in.-thick wall of the crucible, as in the pre-
vious tesf,] and caused it to crack end crumble.

The only macroscopically visible sign of attack on
the crucibie that contained the fluoride mixture was
that the inner surface had a higher gloss (Fig. 6.11)
after exposure. Metallographic examination of
sections of the crucibie indicated irregular pene-
tration from 0 to 5 mils deep. No attempt has been
made to determine whether reaction products ac-
companied the penetration. This attack may be

UF4 (50-46-4 mole %) in the previous tests.! The
carbon content of the fluoride mixture did not change
significantly in either test,

A comparison of the carburization of austenitic
stainless stee! by tar-impregnated and fired graphite
and by C-18 graphite (reactor grade) was obtained
through static tests of cylinders of the same size
of each type of graphite in type 304 stainless steel
tubes containing equal quantities of sodium in
vacuum. Tests for 100- and 500-hr periods ai
1500°C were made on each type of graphite. Type
304 stainless steel was chosen because it carbur-
izes more readily than other austenitic stainless
steels,

The results of the tests are shown in Figs. 6.12
and 6.13. In the 100-hr test, the tar-impregnated
and fired graphite carburized the type 304 stainless
steel to a slightly greater extent than the C-18
graphite did, and in the 300-hr test, it clearly car-
burized the steel to a greater extent. After the
500-hr tests of both types of graphite, steel in con-
tact with the sodium showed small subsurface
voids; the voids were pronounced in the steel tested
with the tar-impregnated and fired graphite. The
depth of carburization of the type 304 stainless
steel above the level of the molten sodium covering
the graphite cylinders was 1 mil in all the tests,
except the 500-hr test with a tar-impregnated and
fired graphite cylinder in which there was carbu-
rization of the steel to a depth of 2 mils.

Ceromics in Various Mediums

Static corrosion screening tests of three ceramic
oxides and one carbide (Al,05, MgAl,0,, calcium
stabilized Zroz, and SiC) were made in a vacuum
atmosphere at 1500°F for 100 hr in each of four
mediums: sodium, NaF-ZrF ,-UF (53.5-40-6.5 mole
%}, lithium, and lead. A fourth ceramic oxide was
tested under the same conditions in sodium and in
NaF-Z¢F ,-UF, (53.5-40-6.5 mole %). The Al 0,
and MgAl,O, test pieces were cut from single,
synthesized crystals; the MgO test pieces were
cleaved from a single, synthesized crystal. The
nominal dimensions of the test pieces and the re-

sults of the tests are given in Table 6.5, Powder
x-ray exdaminations were made of the specimens
that were the least corrosion resistant in each
medium, and the results are summarized in Table

6.6.

The SiC specimens were, in general, the most
resistant to corrosion, and the Al,C; specimens
were the next most resistant. These single-run
screening tests ore qualitative, and the results
should be used with caution. Larger specimens
ore to be tested so that more accurate data can be
obtained oand metallographic examinations and

chemica!l onolyses can be made.

compared with the corrosive properties of UF .-
bearing mixtures. Additional tests with UF ;-bearing
ZrF ,-bose mixtures have confirmed the reduchon

formation of a hot-leg layer. The lack of attack
and the hot-leg layer are illustrated in Fig. 6.14.

ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

The portion of a hot leg shown in Fig. 6.14 was
taken from an Incone! thermal-convection loop which
had circulated UF3 (2.1 wt % UF, in 2.4 wt %
total U) in NaF-ZrF4 (53-47 wmole %) for 500 hr at
o hot-leg temperature of 1500°F, The fluoride mix-
ture was drained from the loop af the operating
temperature to ascertain whether the layers pre-
viously noted had formed during cooling of the loop.
Since the layer wos again present, it is now con-
sidered to have formed during operation. This
conclusion was further strengthened when the
metal lographic examination revealed o diffusion
zone hetween the loyer and the base metal. An
examination of the layer by a microspark spectro-
grophic technique® showed it to be predominantly
zirconium. Since this technique is not sensitive
to uranium, the layer could also contain uranium.

There is some indication that some of the UF
dissociates fo produce uranium metal, which re-
duces some of the ZrF4 to produce zirconium metal,
The accuracy of the analytical determination for
zirconium is not sufficient o revea! the reaction
products postulated, since some zirconium is also
lost by sublimation.

In another Incone! loop in which UF., in NaF-
ZrF, was circulated for 2000 hr at 1500°F, some

voids were found to a depth of 4 mils upon metalle-

graphic examination. The voids did not appear to
be the same as those normally found, and it is
thought that they were formed when brittle inter-
metallic compounds were pulled out of the base
metal during polishing. No hot-leg attack could be
found, as shown in Fig. 6.15, but there was a layer
0.5 mil thick on the hot-leg surface. This layer
was also reported to be predominantly zirconium,

It has been definitely established that the use of
UF; rather than UF, in ZrF -base mixtures will
lower the corrosive attack and mass transfer in
Inconel systems. However, it has been found to be
impossible to dissolve sufficient UF, in ZrF ,-base
mixtures to obtain fuels of interest for high-temper-
oture reactors. To obtein a fuel with sufficient
vranium, it would be necessary to use a mixture
of UF, and UF,. Daia obtained from loops oper-
ated with such mixtures and with standard UF .-
bearing mixtures are presented in Table 6.7. The
data show clearly that a mixture of UF; and UF,
produces less attack than UF , alone, but the mix-
ture does not eliminate the attack, as is the case
with UF 5 alene,

Effect of UF3 in Alkali-Meta! Base Fuels

It has been found that more UF, can be dissolved
in the alkali-metal-base fluoride mixtures than in
the ZrF ,-base mixtures, and therefore additional
tests were made with NaF-KF-LiF (11.5.42.0.44.5
mole %) containing UF,, UF,, and mixtures of the
two,

Two Inconel loops were operated for 500 hr with
NoF-KF-UF to which UF, ond UF, had been
added. Because of sampling and analytical dif-
ficulties, the relative amounts of UF, and UF, are
not known, but it appears that about one-third of
the uranium was present as U’F3. One loop con-
tained a total uranium content of 10.4 wt %, and
after the test the hot leg showed light, widely
scattered attack to a depth of 1 mil (Fig. 6.16);
the hot-leg surface was quite rough. The other
loop contained 7.4 wt % uranium, and the hot leg
showed a void type of attack that varied from light
to heavy, with a maximum penetration of 2 mils;
again, the surface was rough, In both loops, a
layer was found in the coid leg but not in the hot
leg. These mixtures appear to be superior to the
ZrF ;-base mixtures with UF, with respect to depth
of the subsurface void type of attack, and the hot-
leg deposit found with the UF -bearing ZrF ,-base
mixtures did not form. More work is needed to de-
termine whether the rough surfaces represent a
different type of attack and whether the cold-leg
deposits formed are NaK,CrF,, which would
interfere with heat transfer.

Effect of Zirconium Hydride Additions to Fuel

Various amounts of zirconium hydride were added
to NaF-ZrF ,-UF, (50-46-4 mole %) as a means of
reducing the UF, to UF;. The hydride was added
to small portions of fluorides taken from the same
original batch, and filters were used when the
small batches were transferred to Inconel thermal-
convection loops. The data from loops operated
with these batches of fluoride mixture are given in
Table 6.8. lLayers were found in the cold legs of
all loops to which the ZrH, additions had been
made. The data show that to obtain sufficient
reducing power by the addition of ZrH, to eliminate
corrosion it may be impossible to prevent the loss
of some uranium both in the treatment pot and in
the loop.

Effect of Uranium Concentration

Two loops were operated with a high-purity NaF-
ZrF ,-UF, (53.5-40-6.5 mole %) mixture. This mix-
ture is comparable to the one to be used in the
ARE and has a higher uranium content than the
mixture normally used in thermal-convection loop
tests. The heavy hot-leg attack in both loops was
of the usual subsurface-void type with @ maximum
penetration of 10 mils. This is slightly deeper
than the 6 to 8 mils found with the lower uranium
content mixtures. Thin metallic-appearing layers
were found in the cold legs of both loops. The
results obtained with these loops confirm those
found previously with similar, but impure, mixtures.

Effect of Inconel Groin Size

Incone! pipe was annealed at two temperatures to
provide specimens with different grain sizes. A

series of loops fabricoted from the annealed pipe
was filled from the same batch of NaF-ZrF -UF,
(50-46-4 mole %) and operated for 500 hr ot 1500°F.
Two loops were made from pipe annealed at 2100°F
that had a grain size of 1 to ]]/2 gr/in.? at 100 X,
while the loop fabricated from as-received lnconel
pipe and the one fabricated from pipe annealed at
1600°F contained about 6 gr/in.2. Very little dif-
ference in hot-leg attack was found in these loops.
Those with the larger grains may have had slightly
deeper attack, but the attack was heavier and more
general and the deep penetrations were concentrated
into fewer boundaries.

Loops fabricated from both as-received and over-
aged Hastelloy B were operated satisfactorily.
The operating mortality rate has been reduced from
90% to 0% in the last group of four loops. The
increase in hardness during operation is not so
great in the loops constructed with over-oged
material as in the loops constructed with as-
received material, but, with proper care, the loops
of as-received material can be operated.

Very little attack was found in a loop which
circulated NaF-Zrf ,-UF, (50-46-4 mole %) for
1000 hr at 1500°F. The attack appeared as a few
voids to a maximum depth of 1 mil, with possibly
some increase in surface roughness. Most of the
surface roughness was present in the as-received
tubing, as shown in Fig. 6.17.

these tests was there any indication of plug forma-

and have been examined macroscopically. Loop 2
was very similar in appearance to loop 1, with no

mass-transfer crystals attached to the cold-zone
walls.  These crystals did not plug the loop or
noticeably affect the circulation. The crystal
deposition was heaviest on the maojor radius of the
exposed loop-bend wall in the cold zone. This
loop has not yet been examined metallographically.

Loop 1, which was operated at the highest temper-

had no mass-transfer crystals in the cold zone, and
the moaximum attack in the hot zone was 1 to 2
mils (Fig. 6.18). Chemical analyses of the lithium
and the amounts of crystals recovered are presented
in Tcble 6.10. At present it is not understood why
so little moss transfer occurred in loops 1 and 2,
since in all three loops the same procedures and
testing techniques were used and all were filled
from the same batch of lithium. Some as yet un-
discovered factor seems to have an effect on the
rate of mass transfer.

Mass Transfer in Liquid Lead

J. V. Cathcart
Metallurgy Division

As previously reported,® the investigation of
corrosion and mass transfer in liquid lead has indi-
cated that certain alloys possess much greater
resistance to mass transfer than their pure com-
porients. For example, the time required for small
thermal-convection loops containing types 410 and
446 stoinless steel to plug was from two to five
times longer than that required for comparable loops
confaining pure iron or pure chromium.

It has been suggested® that the increased re-
sistance to mass fransfer of materials such as the
400 series stainless steels might be related to a
tendency toward the formation of intermetallic
compounds in these alloys. To test this hypothesis

further, a loop was operated which contained speci-
mens of a specially prepared 45% Cr—55% Co alloy.
This alloy composition corresponded to a two-phase
region in the cobalt-chromium phase diagram, one
phase being the intermetallic compound CoCr, The

and cold-leg temperotures of 820 and 510°C, re-

specimen is shown in Fig. 6.19. '

revealed that the plugging time for all those in
which intermetallic compound formation is a possi-
bility [types 410 and 446 stainless steel, 2%
Si~14% Cr~84% Fe, Hastelloy B (5% Fe-28% Mo~
67% Ni), 25% Mo—75% Ni, 45% Cr—55% Co, and 16%

excess of 500 hr, the only exception being the loop
containing the 16% Ni-37% Cr~47% Fe specimens
which plugged in 456 hr. The plugging times for
loops containing the pure coristituents of these
alloys were: Ni, 2 hr; Co, 80 hr; Cr, 100 hr; and
Fe, 250 hr. No mass transfer was observed in a
loop containing molybdenum specimens after 500

hr of operation. On the other hand, loops with
specimens of alloys for which there is virtually no
tendency toward compound formation (types 304
and 347 stainless steel, Inconel, and nichrome)
all plugged in less than 150 hr. On the basis of
these data, it was concluded that resistance to
mass transfer in liquid lead is considerably greater
in alloys in which intermetallic compound formation
is possible.

Future work will include tests of two alloys: one
with the composition of 50% Cr—50% Fe and the
other with approximately 50% Fe~50% Mo. These
compositions correspond closely to the composi-
tions of intermetallic compounds in types 410 and
446 stainless steel, and if the ideas presented
above are correct, both should show relatively
high resistance to mass transfer in liquid lead.

These entropy data are obtained from the standard-
state entropy values. The change in slope ot each
transition point is determined from the transition
entropy, which, of course, is readily computed from
the heat of transition.

Recently cbtained data'? on the heat capacity of
liquid sodium hydroxide wili permit a more precise
evaluation to be made of the slope of the free
energy curve from the melting point up to 1000°C.
The heat of fusion of sodium peroxide (TM =~ 980°K)
was not available, but it should introduce only a
small change in slope, which may be considered to
be negligible for the computations which follow.

Decomposition of Hydroxides. In considering any
solvent as a reaction medium it is important to de-
termine whether the solvent tends to decompose to
an appreciable extent, particuiarly if any of the
products of the decomposition take part in the re-
action. The classic example is, of course, water.
Here the covalent water molecules decompose
slightly into ions. The resulting equilibrium fre-
quently exerts a controlling influence on the course
of aqueous reactions. The following is an outline
of the results obtained to date in a theoretical
search for the significant decomposition equilibria
in fused alkali-metal hydroxides. It should be
emphasized that the work presented here is in no
sense definitive or complete.

The most important result of the treatment given
here is the evidence for the possible occurrence of
appreciable quantities of peroxide as the result of
decomposition equilibria. The way in which this
peroxide may play a decisive role in mass transfer
and corrosion will be shown in o later report.

In a fused alkali-metal hydroxide in an inert
environment such that the volume of any gas phase
is small compared with that of the liquid phase,
the fused hydroxide may be regarded thermodynami-
cally as being in equilibrium with every chemical
species composed of nothihg more than oxygen,
hydrogen, and the alkali metal. In practice, many
of these chemical species can be ignored for either

First, the equilibrium concentra-
tion of the species in question maybe insignificant.
Second, the rate of formation of the species in
question may be so slow that it does not approach
equilibrium in any time period which may be con-
sidered,

of two reasons.

Since in the following discussion the
thermodynamic approach is used, only the first
reason will be treated.

There are three particularly useful theoretical
measures of the significance of a decomposition
They are the equilibrium constant, the
standard free energy change, and the concentration
of the products of decomposition. The third measure
is the most directly related to experiment and hence,
at the present stage, the most useful. The eonly
concentration in o fused hydroxide which can be

reaction.

meosvred at temperature by present methods is the
partial pressure of a gaseous product. Hence,
considerable emphasis is placed on possible de-
composition reactions which produce gaseous
products and on an expression of their equilibrium
concentrations in terms of the decomposition
pressure,

The decomposition pressure of a pure substance
with regard to a gaseous product is referred to here
as that partial pressure of the gaseous product
which, when in equilibrium with the condensed
phase, is required to maintain the over-all composi-
tion of the condensed phase equal to the composition
of the pure substance. According to the phase
rule, the pressure so defined is unique for a given
temperature. If there are several gaseous products,
there is o decomposition pressure for each such
product.

The standard states used here ore those con-
ventionally chosen in defining the standord free
energy of formation. Although this is not the usual
choice of standard states in the case of solutes,
it is definitely the most convenient choice for the
computations which follow.

The four possible decomposition reactions which
give a gaseous product at the temperatures at which
the hydroxides are liquid are considered here,
They are as follows:

K
(1) 280H =' M,0 + H,0, AFS
K2 o
(2) 2MOH =2 M,0, + H, , AFS
K3 o
(3) 2MOH = MO, + M + H, , AFS -,

104

K
(4) 2MOH =* MO, + MH + LH, ,  AFY,

where all substances are partitioned among all
phases present and where K. and AF? are the
equilibrium constants and standard free energies
of reaction respectively.

The sparsity of reliable information on the alkali
metal-oxygen compounds raises serious questions
about the application of all the above squilibric to
all the alkali metals. This subject is treated by
Brewer® and will not be repeated here, However,
it is the essential point of this treatment to de-
termine whether unsaturated oxygen ions such as
the peroxide and superoxide ions may occur as
decomposition products, in addition to the saturated
oxide ion. The existence of some sort of unsatu-
rated oxygen ion is certain for all the alkali metals,
and it is known that the stability of the unsaturated
species increases in going from [ithium to cesium.
Therefore, the basic competition referred to below
between hydrogen and the mono-oxide for water
should be a characteristic of all hydroxide de-
composition equilibria and should lead to a water-
hydrogen equilibrium in the gas phase of the type
discussed. The data for sodium compounds ore
reasonobly reliable. Hence, sodium hydroxide will
be treated separately.

The above equations are exact. However, a more
useful form can be obtained by assuming that the
extent of decomposition is very small. As will be
shown later, this assumption involves a negligible
error for all four reactions. From this assumption
two conclusions can be drawn: (1) the activity of
the hydroxide as used in the above equations may
be taken to be unity because of the choice of
standard states; (2) the partial pressures of water
and hydrogen in the gas phase may be taken to be
equal to the fugacities in the gas phase and hence
equal to the fugacities in the liquid phase. Finally,
by definition, the fugacity of the gases in the
standard reference state is unity. Substituting
these conclusions into the above squations, selving
for the partial pressures, and applying the reaction
isotherm give

From the original choice of mole fractions if
moy be noted that the above partial pressures are
the decomposition pressures and that there are

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1954

three values of the decomposition pressure with
respect to hydrogen. Except over unique temper-
ature ranges, one of these three decomposition
pressures will be much larger than the other two
and hence, by the law of mass action, will stabilize
the others. Thus, only one of the three pressures
will be the decomposition pressure of MOH with
regard to hydrogen.

Because of the lack of thermodynamic dota on
all the alkali-metal hydroxides except sodium, it
is necessary, in most opplications, to use ratios
of decomposition pressures.. Thus, it is assumed
that reactions 1 and 2 are simultaneocusly at equi-
fibrivm and that they determine the gaseous water
and hydrogen pressures, respectively. By dividing

By using the free energy data computed above
for sodium hydroxide, the representative values

shown in Table 6.11 were obtained. The pressure-
activity coefficient products in this table give the
pressures which would be obtained if the solutions
were ideal. Figure (.23 shows the relative im-
portance of equilibria 1 and 2 in terms of the logo-
rithm of the pressure ratio as a function of the
reciprocal of the absolute temperature. Figure
6.24 gives the free energy differences (AF‘I’ , and
AF‘]"3) as functions of absolute fempemfure.'

Examination of these data shows the following:
(1) Apart from unexpectedly large deviations from
ideality, equilibrium 1 will predominate at all
temperatures.  (2) Assuming ideality, hydrogen
evolution from fused sodium hydroxide in an inert
container will be small at all temperatures, but it
should be measurable at 900°C. Likewise, the
peroxide concentration at all temperatures may be
small, but it should be appreciable at 900°C. (3)
Deviations from ideality of a moderate amount
could make hydrogen and peroxide formation either
insignificant or greatly important at high temper-
atures,

There are no satisfactory heat of formation
dota for any of the alkali-metal hydroxides other
than those for sodium. Therefore, only the rela-
tive importance of the decomposition equilibria
can be studied. Some of the entropy values for
the higher oxides have been estimated and are
in the literature. However, the heats

of formation for
are quite uncertain, and it is. presently believed
that the accuracy of the AF‘{ 5 and [\I*1 5 values
given in Table 6.12 would not be improved by
use of these entropy estimates. Therefore, only
enthalpy values will be used, but it will be shown
that this restriction is not so serious as it might

Various investigations of corrosion and mass

transfer have shown the fundomental role played
by hydrogen. The above computations show that
hydrogen is important in stabilizing sodium hy-
droxide at temperatures above 600°C, as shown in

mass transfer becomes significant. These compu-
tations also link the formation of hydrogen with
the formation of unsaturated oxygen ions. As will
be shown in a subsequent report, the presence of

transfer to occur. As may be seen in Table 6.12,
hydrogen and the unsaturated oxygen ions are most
important for the hydroxides of potassium, rubidium,
and cesium.

Furthermore, these computations provide the first
estimate of the thermal stability of the alkali-metal
hydroxides (other than LiOH). These estimates
confirm the frequently made assumption that the
alkali-metal hydroxides are by far the most thermally
stable hydrogen-containing liquids known.

It must be emphasized that these computations
are given as o progress report in a continuing in-
vestigation. Thus, many of the valuesobtained,
such as the standard free energies of formation, do
not in themselves provide direct information about
hydroxide corrosion, but they are essential values
for any theoretical investigations of corrosion,

Experimental Studies (with M. E. Steidlitz, Metal-
lurgy Division). An investigation is under way to
determine experimentally whether a significant
amount of hydrogen is liberated when NaOH is
heated to 900°C in an inert environment. The pre-
liminary method being tested is tc use a pair of
automatic Toepler pumps to concentrate any gaseous
products liberated from the hydroxide. The col-
lected gas is analyzed with a mass spectrometer,
The most difficult aspect of this research has been
the endeavor to provide an inert container for the
NaOH, which reacts with all metals studied at
900°C (including the most noble metals) to pro-
duce hydrogen. It reacts strongly with nearly all
ceramics except magnesium oxide. Unfortunately,
nonporous crucibles of pure MgO are not available
because of the difficulty in sintering this material.
Ordinary MgQ crucibles, which usually contain a
small amount of binder such as silica, breck down
due to attack on the binder. The problem was
salved by machining out large single crystals of
pure magnesium oxide prepared by the Ceramics
Group.

In the experiments which have been performed
to date, appreciable quontities of hydrogen have
been found in addition to much larger quantities of
water. However, there was evidence of contamina-
tion by organic material and the hydrogen may have
come from this source. These studiesare continuing.

CHEMICAL STUDIES OF CORROSION

F. Kertesz
Materials Chemistry Division

Effect of Temperature on Corrosion of
lncone!l and Type 316 Stainless Steel

H. J. Buttram R. E. Meadows
N. V. Smith

Materials Chemistry Division

The effect of temperature on the corrosion of
Inconel by molten fluorides in static tests, as
indicated by the extent of void formation observed
and by chromium concentration of the melt, was
discussed in a previous repart.'? In those studies
there was soime evidence that a maximum in the
corrosion could be observed at 800 to 900°C and
that both void formation and chromium concentration
in the melt were less at 1000°C than at 800°C.
While it is possible to rationalize the decreased
void formation on the basis that a high rate of dif-
fusion for chromium in the metal may minimize the
formation of voids, the decreased chromium con-
centration in the melt is, however, more difficult
to explain.

During the past quarter NaZrF ; and NaF-ZrF ,-UF
(53.5-40-6.5 mole %) were tested in type 316 stain-
less steel under static and nearly isothermal con-
ditions for 100 hr at 100°C intervals over the range
600 to 1000°C, as a check of the findings with
Inconel. Metallographic examination of the cap-
sules exposed at 600°C revealed light intergranular
penetration up to 1 mil in depth. At 1000°C the
attack was still light, but one isolated case of
intergranular penetration to a depth of 18 mils was
noted. When the chromium concentration of the
melt was plotted against test temperature for the
NaZrF ., a slight maximum in the curve appeared
between 800 and 900°C; a similar plot for the UF ,-
bearing mixture shows a plateau between 700 to
1000°C. However, more chromium appeared in
solution in the NeZrF ¢ samples than in the UF,-
bearing mixtures. The tendency toward less cor-
rosion at 1000°C than ot 800°C never appears to
be pronounced, but it has been sufficiently persistent
in these tests to require explanation.

A plausible explanation can be evolved in the
following manner. The NaZrF, melt which has
been used in these experiments gove rise to ab-
normally high chromium concentrotions (1000 ppm)
compared with equilibrium values (200 ppm) ob-
tained in measurements carried out with carefully
handled melts and pure chromium metal. It appears,
therefore, that impurities were predominantly re-
sponsible for the amounts of corrosion measured.
The most likely impurity is HF, which con result
from hydrolysis of adsorbed water or hydrated water
in salts containing Na Zr,F,, or from inadequate
purification.

If HF were responsible, the ascending portion of
the curve could be due to an increasing rate of
reaction with increasing temperature. (There is
little reason to believe that equilibrium conditions
are reached in static capsules in 100 hr.) The
descending portion of the curve may be ascribed to
a marked decrease in corrosiveness of HF at
increasing temperatures.

Standard free energy estimates'* show that AF®
for the reaction of HF with Ni to form NiF, becomes
positive near 300°C, with Fe to form FeF, ot
800°C, and with Cr to form Crf, at 1400°C. In
the experiments under discussion here, the melt at
the end of a 100-hr test contains mostly Cr*¥, with
very little Fe*" and Ni*™,

There is some evidence that at the lower temper-
ature ali three elements are attacked rather slowly
and indiscriminately by HF and that the resulting
Fe'' and Ni*' are replaced by Cr*™¥ in o fast
secondary reaction. The effect of increasing
temperature is to increase the degree of approach
to equilibrium in 100 hr in a static capsule; how-
ever, at higher temperatures the effect of a more

unfavorable equilibrium constant becomes manifest.

Iron and nickel are relatively unreactive toward HF
at 1000°C, and the amount of Cr™" pickup in 100 hr
could well be less than that noted at 800°C for
three reasons: the free energy change for the
reaction of chromium with HF is smaller, fewer
Fe** and Nit" ions are present for reaction with
Cr**, and there is mechanical interference by the
unreacted nickel and iron. In other words, chromium
is most readily oxidized from an alloy by HF if the
accompanying alloy constituents are alsc attocked.

was corrosion tested. Very heavy attack was
observed; this was expected, not becouse normal
amounts of fission products are particularly cor-
rosive but because oxidizing agents such as RuF ,
MoBr3, and elemental tellurium were used in suffi-
cient concentration fo cause excessive corrosion
in any case,

Additional experiments were performed with the
use of the same additives, individually, in amounts
as small as possible in an attempt to measure the
relative activities as corrosive agents. Preliminary
results, such as those previously reported which
showed YF, to be extremely corrosive, and oddi-
tional trials during the past quarter, which showed
that such compounds as CsF were also very cor-
rosive, made it obvious that the techniques em-
ployed were unsuitable and that very misleading
indications were being obtained. Free energy
considerations, as well as general experience with
fluoride systems in closed capsules, make it ap-
parent that impurities such as HF and water were
responsible for the effects noted. Hence it must
be concluded that none of the experiments per-
formed to date on corrosion by simulated fission
products have heen sotisfactory for the intended
purpose.

Controlled-Yelocity Corrosion Testing Apparatys

Materials Chemistry Division

In order to more nearly simulate corrosion con-
ditions of molten fluorides circulating through
reactor components, a controlled-velocity corrosion
testing apparatus has been constructed. This ap-
paratus, similar to one previously described, '® al-
lows the rapid transfer of molten fluorides through
both heated and cooled test sections. The apparatus
consists of two 4-in.~1D, 24-in.-high Inconel cylin-
drical pots connected by means of three sections of
1/‘(in. inconel tubing with ¢ wall thickness of 0.035
in. The two outside sections are 5 t long and the
center section, which was initially 1 ft long, was
later increased to 3]/2 ft. The center section is
cooled by either oir or water. Suitable furnaces
and heaters permit holding the pots and transfer
lines at desired temperatures. FEach Inconel pot
has a gos inlet which allows opplication of helium

at predetermined pressures to transfer the melt, A
probe indicates when the desired liquid level is
reached in the second pot and activates a relay
which closes the helium inlet to the first pot and
opens a corresponding one in the second pot to
reverse the cycle.

Velocities obtained with the apparatus have
reached 5 fps, which corresponds to a Reynolds
number of only about 1500. It is hoped that an
improved design now being assembled will make
possible turbulent flow. A 200°C gradient across
the cooling section was desired; however, it has
not yet been possible to achieve a differential of
more than &0°C. The transfer cycle consists in
having the melt contained in either pot at 700°C,
being heated to 800°C in the first section of the
transfer line, cooled in the middle section, brought
back to 700°C in the third section, momentarily
stored in the opposite pot at 700°C, and then the
cycle is reversed, A complete cycle, that is, from
one pot to the other and back, required approxi-
mately 5 min. It is believed that this apparatus will
yield corrosion data under conditions not easily
obtainable by present means.

Reaction Between Grophite cad Flueride Melt
F. A. Kinox

Materials Chemisiry Division

Graphite has been used extensively as a con-
tainer material during preparations of fuel and

110

coolant materials; therefore, an investigation was
made of possible reaction between it and a fluoride
melt. In the procedure used an lnconel reaction
tube was loaded with either NaF-ZrF -UF, (53.5-
40-6.5 mole %)} alone or with the fluoride mixture
plus graphite which had been treated under vacuum
for degassing. The reaction tube was connected
to @ manometer and then held at 1000°C until the
gas pressure became constant.

It was found that the rather large gas pressures
obtained were due chiefly to SiF,. Analysis of
the graphite indicated the presence of nearly 1%
Si. The use of spectrographically pure graphite in
this apparatus has yielded pressures very nearly
the same as the pressure of the pure fluoride. No
HF or CF, was detected during these tests.

Lithium Fivoride Castings

At the request of the Instrumentation and Controls
Division, high-density lithium fluoride cylinders
were cast from powdered material for use in an
x-ray spectrometer. These cylinders were pre-
pared by charging the powder to grophite crucibles
and heaiing in an inert atmosphere to 900°C. The
graphite liner containing the melt was then re-
moved from the furnace and a strong air jet was
applied to its periphery. The resulting cylinders
were uniform and acceptable.

7. METALLURGY

W. D. Maniy
Metallurgy Division

Creep and stress-rupture testing have, in the
past, been performed primarily on uniaxially stressed
specimens. lests of this type are continuing, but
the interest is now centfered on tube-burst tests in
which a tube that is closed at one end is stressed
with on internal gas pressure. The stress pattern
introduced into the specimen in this test more
nearly approaches the stress pattern that will be
found in ANP-type reactors. The ratio of the tan-
gential stress to the longitudinal stress is quite
important in the ductility of the metal being tested,
and therefore equipment in which the lengitudinal
and the tangential stresses can be varied has been
constructed. A theoretical analysis of a stressed
cylindrical pressure vessel has been made with
which a check on the experimental results con be
obtained. Also, to determine the effect of tan-
gential and compressive stresses on the corrosion
rate of metal in contact with fused salts, an ap-
paratus for loading a sheet specimen in bending
was designed and constructed; tests are now being
made.

In the investigation of high-thermal-conductivity
materials for fins for sodium-to-air radiators, stresse
rupture and creep tests were made on copper fins
with various types of cladding at stress levels be-
tween 500 and 2000 psi at 1500°F. The tests have
shown that for a 1000-hr exposure in air, stresses
greater than 500 psi and less than 1000 psi are
tolerable; that is, in this stress range there is no
indication of brittleness in the core or oxidation of
the core due to cladding failure, Thermal conduc-
tivity measurements of a 6% Al-94% Cu aluminum
bronze were made in the temperature range 212 to
1562°F, '

Tests of brazing alloys have shown that in braz-
ing high-conductivity fin materials to Inconel tubing
there are four alloys that can be used: low-melting-
point Nicrobraz (LMNB)}, Coast Metals alloy 52,
electroless nickel, and an Ni-P-Cr alloy. From the
over-all considerations of melting point, oxidation
resistance, dilution of fin and tube wall, formation
of low-melting eutectics, and flowability, it was
found that Coast Metals alloy 52 was the best
alloy for the construction of radiators with high-
conductivity fins.

A sodium-to-air radiator with 6 in. of type-430
stainless-steel-clad copper high-conductivity fins
was fabricated by using a combination heliarc
welding and brazing procedure. The tube-to-fin
sections were assembled and brozed with Coast
Metals alloy 52. The tube-to-header joints were
made by using the semiautomatic welding equipment
and then back-brazing. The header sections were
closed by manual heliarc welding.

In the construction of a 100-kw gas-fired liquid-
metal-heater system, packed-rod nozzle assemblies
were needed as the inlets for gir and gas. These
devices were made by brazing ]/B-in.-dicu stainless
steel rods in o tight ossembly with a ductile,
oxidation-resistant alloy of 82% Au-18% Ni.

Work has started on the formation of duplex tubing
in an attempt to prepare alloy composites that have
good corrosijon resistance on the inner surface and
oxidation resistance on the outer surface. Com-
posites of copper and type 310 stainiess steel,
Inconel and type 310 stainless steel, Inconel and
Hastelloy B, and Hastelloy B and type 310 stainless
steel have been prepared. Tubing produced from
stainless-steel-clad molybdenum and columbium and
from several special Inconel-type alloys was fabri-
cated into thermal convection loops for fluoride
corrosion testing. Several new alloys were produced
for the corrosion tests with liquid lead.

Attempts are being made to find new olloys in
the nickel-molybdenum system that will have better
high-temperature strength and fluoride corrosion
resistance than Inconel has. Hastelloy B satisfies
these requirements, but it has poor fabrication
properties and oxidation resistance, and it loses
its ductility in the temperature range of interest for
application in high-temperature circulating-fuel re-
actors. Investigations are under way in an effort
to find a suitable melting and heating treatment that
will increase the ductility of Hastelloy B in the
temperature range of interest,

Investigations of methods for producing boron
carbide shield pieces of the required density and
shape indicate that the pieces should be molded
with nonmetallic bonding material by cold pressing
followed by sintering. The bonding materials being

m
ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

studied include sodium silicate, silica, silicon
nitride, and boric oxide.

The fluoride-to-sodium intermediate heat ex-
changer, which failed in a life test after 1680 hr of
cyclic service in the temperature range 1080 to
1500°F, was exomined, |t is probable that the
failures in the tube-to-header welds were caused
by unequal thermal expansion, which caused stress
concentration at the roots of the tube-to-header
welds. These stresses, combined with expansion
and contraction of the tubes, would tend to propa-
gate cracks through the walls. These failures
emphasize the extreme desirability of using back-
brazing as o means of minimizing the notch effect
in tube-to-header welds.

STRESS-RUPTURE TESTS OF INCONEL

R. B. Oliver D. A. Douglas
J. H. DeVan J. W. Woods
Metallurgy Division

The tube-burst test for obtaining information on
the stress-rupture properties of Inconel has been
studied intensively. The siress pattern introduced
intfo the specimen in this test simulates to some
extent the stress pattern that will be present in
circulating-fuel reactors. The test consists of
stressing a closed-end tube with internal gos pres-
sure. In tests of this type reported previously, | it
was observed that Inconel specimens stressed in
this manner showed less ductility and much shorter
rupture life than the uniaxially stressed specimens,
and therefore an intensive study of the multiaxial
stress system was initiated. W. Jordan of the
Mechanics Deportment of the University of Alobama
is investigating this problem.

Part of the investigation consists of a study of
the theory of stresses in cylindrical pressure ves-
sels, with particular attention to the variations in
siresses calculated by the thin-wal! formula vs the
stresses determined by the more exact Lamé theory.
The stresses under discussion are those in the
walls only, with no consideration given to the end
closure shape, except that the ends are assumed to
be completely closed. The three principal stresses
at a given point are the radial stress (o), the tan-
gential (hoop) stress (o), and the longitudinal
(axial) stress (o ). The theory of elasticity yields

that the stresses are distributed uniformly across
the wall. Under inelastic (including creep) con-
ditions, it is believed that the tangential (hoop)
stress distribution lies somewhere between those
assumed in the Lamé and in the approximate elastic
theories. With increasing stress, increasing temper-
ature, and increasing time, the actual stress dis-
tribution will depart from the Lamé assumption and
approach the thin-wall theory assumption. Thus
the two theories give the upper and lower bounds
for the actual stress distribution.

For the longitudinal (axial) stresses, the Lame
and the thin-wall theories both use the assumption
that the stresses are uniformly distributed over the
cross section, Since the Lame theory uses the
correct value for the cross-sectional area, while
the thin-wall theory uses an approximate area, the
Lamé theory is believed to be more correct in both
the elastic and the inelastic ranges of stress. The
majority of the tube-burst tests made to date have
been of 0.010- and 0.020-in.-wall tubing, and thus
the approximate formulao applies. Specimens are
now being tested which have 0.060-in. walls, Since
it is predicted that under the test conditions the

stress will be uniform across the wall thickness
the approximate formula will be used for calculating
the stresses, and the slight error thus introduced
will be neglected,

It is well known that in the case of a thin-walled
closed-cylinder pressure vessel the ratio of the
tangential (hoop) stress to the longitudinal (axial)
stress is 2:1. Some investigators have shown that
this stress distribution results in the minimum
ductility for a given material, Therefore, in order
to better understond the criteria for predicting
failure of tubular specimens and in order to study
the effects of anisotropy of the tubular material, it
would be desirable to be able to test a series of
specimens with varying stress ratios. Jordan has
devised the apparatus described below with which
it is possible to stress a tubular specimen purely
tangentially, purely axially, or in ony desired ratio
of these stresses. '

ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

The most obvious method of changing the stress
ratic is by loading a tubular specimen axially with
dead weaights ond producing an axial stress without
the use of pressure, so that o /0 =0, By using
movable pistons for the ends of the cylinder, as
shown in Fig. 7.2, all the axial load caused by the
pressure acting on the pistons is borne by the rod
connecting the pistons. This will reduce the axial
stress in the cylinder wall to zero (assuming no
friction between piston and cylinder) without af-
fecting the tangential stress. In actual practice,
one piston can be reploced by a fixed end. By
using @ piston of larger net area than the opposite
cylinder end, compressive axial stresses can be
introduced into the cylinder walls without altering
the tangential stresses. This arrongement is shown
in Fig. 7.3. By using thin-walled cylinder approxi-
mations, the siress ratio is given by the equation

As before, the stress ratio is independent of the
diameter 2 of the piston rod. Since the piston rod
is in compression, however, it should be made
large enough to prevent buckling. The bleed lines
shown in Figs. 7.4a and & should be kept open
during testing to assure that no pressure leaks
from the large-diameter chamber to the smaller one.

A test rig has been built that imposes the con-
dition 7 /o Strain measurements made with a
strain-gage bridge fastened to the gage area showed
that the friction in the system was negligible and
that the only active stress was tangential. A speci-

condition,

= oo,

There has been considerable speculation as to
the possibility of o difference in the rate of cor-
rosive attack of fused salts in contact with Inconel
under tensile siresses as compared with lnconel in
compression, In order to observe any difference, it
is desirable that the compressive and tensile
stresses be imposed on the same spscimen and be
of the same magnitude. One approach to this prob-
lem is to test a specimen under pure bending con-
ditions. This would ensure that the magnitude of
the maximum tensile stress would always be equal
to that of the maximum compressive stress during a
given test. An apparatus which would produce this
effect was also designed by Jordan, and a specimen
is now being tested in a fused salt medium. A
drawing of the specimen and the loading opparatus
is presented in Fig. 7.5, If it is assumed that no
friction occurs between pins C and D and the
specimen, all the force P will be transmitted across
section |-l by the link L and no axial force will
exist in the specimen. Likewise, since link L is
loaded axially, it cannot transmit any bending
moment and therefore the specimen must resist any
bending moment existing across section |-l. The
force in link L will be equal to P to satisfy the
equilibrium of forces. The bending moment in the
specimen will then be equal to the product of P and
the horizontal distance between the centers of pins
A and B. In order to minimize variations inthe
bending moment (and therefore stresses) in the
specimen during a test, the horizontal distance
between A and B should be held as nearly constant
as possible. Since the specimen deformsunder load,
the ends will rotate and some change in the distance
AB must occur, In order to minimize the change,
the pins A and B are placed with their centers
slightly above and below, respectively, ahorizontal

The apparatus shown in Fig. 7.5 has been con-
structed. Strain gages were placed on the tension
and compression sides of a specimen, and load was
applied. In the range of loads contemplated in a
creep test, the tensile and compressive strains
were essentially of the same magnitude; thus very
little friction existed between the pins and the

Investigations of Fin Materials

J. H. Coobs

H. Inouye

Stress-rupture and creep tests of type-310 stain-
less-steel-clad copper fins that were 8 mils thick
were made at 1500°F at stresses between 500 and
2000 psi. The material was obtained from the
General Plate Div. of Metals & Controls Corp. and
had an average cladding thickness of 1.87 mils per
side. The maximum cladding thickness was 2.3
mils per side. The results of the several tests
made show that some alteration of the copper oc-
curs even though the specimen does not fracture.
This was indicated by the brittleness of the normally
ductile composite. For long-time exposures (1000
hours}, stresses greater than 500 psi and less than
1000 psi are tolerable and there is no indication of
brittleness in the core or oxidafion due to cladding
failure. In all the specimens which ruptured, oxi-
dation of the copper at the point of fracture was
complete, and the copper which did not appear to
be oxidized was brittle. It was also noted that
when the strain in 2.5 in. was 10%, the copper re-
mained ductile, while strains above 20% (regardless
of exposure time} produced brittleness. The data
obtained are given in Table 7.1, -

The aluminum bronzes are among the materials
being considered as cladding for copper fins. Al-
though extensive diffusion occurs between these
alloys and copper, increases in the thermal con-
ductivity of the fin can be realized by cladding the
copper with these alloys. The composition gradient
existing in a diffused composite results in an in-
crease in the conductivity of the cladding material
(because of the outward diffusion of aluminum) and
a decrease in the conductivity of the copper core.

Thermal conductivity measurements of two alumi-
num bronzes were made by the Solid State Division
and are reported in Table 7.2.  The values given
for measurements at temperatures up to 392°F com-
pare favorably with the data of Smith and Polmer;z
but for temperatures above 392°F they exceed the

Several alloys were investigated for brazing
copper fins clad with Inconel, type 310 stainless
steel, or type 430 stainless steel in order to es-
tablish an optimum combination for fabrication of a
sodium-to-air radiator, The evaluation of these
alloys was bosed on metallographic examination of
tube-to-fin specimens before and after exposure to
static air for periods up to 600 hr, The alloys
tested are listed in Table 7.3.

wall Inconel! tubing with 88% Ni~12% P alloy and
then exposed to staftic air at 1500°F for 600 hr.
Solution of the tube wall during the brazing cycle
was negligible, but rather severe solution of the
fin lip occurred. It is evident, however, that the
oxidation resistonce of the joint was not affected.
Examinations of specimens brazed with the other
alloys listed in Table 7.3 revealed similar results,
that is, minimum solution of tube walls and ex-
cellent oxidation resistance of the braze joints.

The effects of diffusion, however, were in evi-
dence after each test, Color changes in the copper
core, along with the formation of voids, indicate
that the use of Inconel-clad copper in a radiotor
would not be advisable, since the void formation

118

ond the change in core chemistry from copper to a
copper-nickel alloy would seriously reduce the heat
transfer efficiency of the fin. Other claddings, such
as types 310 and 430 stainless steel, have been
found to be relatively immune to diffusion effects,
however, and a number of brazed joints were evalu-
ated to determine the optimum alloy for brazing each
of these materials to Inconel tubing.

A joint of type-310 stainless-steel-clad copper
brazed to Inconel tubing with the 88% Ni-12% P
alloy is shown in Fig. 7.7. It may be seen that fin
dilution and intergranular penetration of the resulting
brazing alloy into the tube wall occurred. This
penetration, undetected in the case of Inconel-clad
copper, appears to be due to the formation of o
complex eutectic resulting from the presence of an
iron-base cladding material rather than from «a
nickel-base material. Similar intergranular pene-
tration was found when the 88% Ni-12% P ailoy

os shown in Fig. 7.8, In this case, the intergranular
penetration was completely through the tube wall.
The etfect of the intergranular penetration on the
physical properties of the tubing has not yet been
determined, but it is believed that it would be ad-
visable to use a brazing alloy that does not react
with the iron-base cladding material. |

flow point of 1925°F is so close to the melting
point of copper that it cannot be used with ease,
Since the oxidation resistance of the Coast Metals
alloy 52 is comparable to that of LMNB and the
effect of boron diffusion is the same for both alloys,
the Coast Metals alloy was selected for the fabri-
cation of the first high-conductivity-fin sodium-to-air
radiator. ' ‘

The problem of edge protection of the clad copper
fins has been resolved. Aluminum is opplied to the
edges of fins by dip coating or spraying, or it is
painted on as aluminum powder in a Nicrobraz
cement slurry. The fin is then heated ot 800°C for
approximately 3/2 hr. The diffusion of the aluminum
into the copper core results in an aluminum bronze
which exhibits excellent resistance to oxidation
when exposed to static air for 500 hr at 1500°F,
It appears that the depth of bronzing, which con-
tinues during oxidation testing, is about 3/32 to 1/8
in. in 500 hr. The feasibility of simultaneously
bronzing large numbers of fins is to be determined.

extremely important in obtaining the completed air-
nozzle blank (Fig. 7.13). Each layer of rods was
tack-welded for rigidity, ond the layers were then
tack-welded to form the assembly. Since the de-
termination of the exact amount of brazing alloy
required was difficult, if not impossible, sufficient
material was used to ensure good bonding at all

these fine scratches acted as capillaries and the

using threadad molybdenum joints, which were then
protected from oxidation by the use of welded cover
plotes. Both loops failed early in corrosion tests
because of fraciure of the cover plates and leakage

frem the |oints.

It is believed that overheating of the cover plates
occurred while the loops were being initially heated
by alectrical resistance., Since no metallurgical
bond existed between the molybdenum and the
cladding, separation became more pronounced with
increased temperatyre, until finally all the current
was being carried by the rather thin cover plates,

Future molybdenum thermal-convection loops will
be made from arc-melted molybdenum, which is
weldoble, and the heavy nickel electrodes required
for resistance heating will be welded directly to
the molybdenum tube instead of to the cladding.

Nickel-Molybdenum-Base Alloys

The nickel-molybdenum-base alloys are also being
studied as part of the effort to obtain alloys with
better high-temperature strength and corrosion re-
sistance than are offered by Inconel. These re-
guirements are met by Hastelloy B; however, some
difficulties have been encountered in attempts to
fabricate this material. In castings and in fusion
welds, o whole range of composition results because
of severe coring during freezing, and thus the
properties of the fobricated specimen vary from one
area to another. Even long-time high-temperature
aging treatments of such material will not produce
an equilibrium structure. The aging treatment also
results in o great increase in hardness with a
cortesponding decrease inductility. At temperatures
between 1200 and 1800°F, the wrought material
exhibits its poorest ductility because of hot short-
ness, which can arise from trace impurities or the
precipitation of an age-hardening constituent, which
is probably the case for Hastelloy B. Thus the
temperature range of poorest ductility of Hastelloy
B coincides with the temperature range of con-
templated use in high-temperature circulating-fuel
Hastelloy B is not recommended for use
in air at temperatures above 1400°F because of

reqactors,
excessive oxidation. A potential source of trouble
exists because of the molybdenum content; molybde-
num oxide has been reported to cause catastrophic
oxidation of surrounding structures, especially the
steels.

The solutions to these problems are being ap-
proached in two major ways. First, attempts are
being made to find suitable melting and heating
treatments of Hastelloy B that will reduce the
degree of age hardening so that both the cast and
wrought materials will possess acceptable properties
in the temperature range of interest. Second,
Hastelloy-type alloys are being siudied. Both
phases of the investigation will involve attempts to
extrude seamless tubing, since, at present, Hastelloy
B tubing must be made by welding strips. Aging
studies of the following materials are now in prog-
ress at temperatures between 1200 and 1700°F:
commercial, wrought, Haostelloy B plate; vacuum-
melted Hastelloy B, as cast; cast and wrought 20%
Mo—80% Ni alloy; wrought 24% Mo—76% Ni alloy.

Some of the properties of the 20% Mo--80% Ni
alloy already obtoined indicate that this alloy will
be easier to fabricate than Hastelloy B from an
extrusion standpoint; sound tubing could be made,
whereas none was obtained from Hastelloy B,

The recrystallization temperature of a 60% cold-
worked sheet of the 20% Mo-80% Ni alioy was ap-
proximately 1900°F for an annealing time of 30
min.  However, this alloy oxidizes in air at 1500°F
at a faster rate than does Hastelloy B, although
under a temperature cycle between room temperature
and 1500°F the oxidation rates are similar. The
scale formed spalis near rocom temperature. A
sheet, 0.065 in. thick, could be heliarc welded
without producing porosity, but an argon arc pro-
duced porosity. In strength tests at 1500°F, the
20% Mo~—80% Ni alloy had a rupture life of 90 hr ot
8000 psi; when tested at 5000 psi for 600 hr, it had
a 3% elongation; during a short-time test the alloy
had atensile strength of 40,000 psi and an elongation
of 10% in a 2-in. gage length.

Oxidation and oxidation-protection studies are in
nrogress to find suitable methods of protecting the
nickel-molybdenum-base alloys during tests in ther-
mal- convection loops and creep-testing apparatus.
This work will be the ground work for further studies
of the protection of reactor components, The coat-
ings being studied are those that can be applied by
methods readily available, that is, chromium electro-
plate, chromium plus nickel electroplate, nickel

plus aluminum spray, and aluminum spray. In
constant-temperature tests, g chromium electroplate
was found to be beneficial. In oxidation tests in-
volving «cycling between room temperature and
1500°F, these coatings eliminate the spalling
characteristics of Hastelloy B. The chromium elec-
troplate and the chromium plus nickel electroplate
afford the best protection.

Duplex Tubing

Attempts have been made to fobricate duplex
seamless tubing that will have good corrosion
resistance on the inner surface ond oxidation
resistance on the outer surface. In the first ex-
periments, attempts were made to deep draw duplex
blanks 4 in. in diometer. The blanks were made by
hot pressing and also by hot rolling. The following
materials were combined by hot pressing 0.025-in,-
thick sheets under an argon atmosphere with Al,0,-
coated graphite dies at 1500 psi.

composite with copper in the center and cover plates

bonding during rolling. |

included in these experiments were some tests
involving the fabrication of composites of molybde-
num and Inconel. The purposes of these tests were
to determine the conditions necessary to obtain a
metallurgical bond by hot rolling, to determine the
extent of directional properties due to the molybde-
num, and to determine whether such a combination
could be deep drawn. The first rolling experiments
were made on an evacuated copsule at 1225°C with
reductions of 10% per pass. The total reduction was
79% in thickness. No bonding was obtained by
using nickel os an intermediate layer between the

Inconel and the molybdenum. In o second series of
experimenis the rolling temperature was reduced to
1000°C, with reductions of 40% per pass and a
total reduction of 85% in thickness., The lower
rolling temperature reduced the tendency for inter-
metallic compounds to form af the interface. Bonding
was achieved by using nickel as the intermediate
layer, and evidences of intermetallic compounds
were found only by metallographic examination af
high magnifications. The final thickness of the

are hard rubber) at room temperature, Attempts to

Sigma-Phase Alloys

For the continuing study of sigma-phase alloy
corrosion by liquid lead (cf. Sec. 6, ‘“Corrosion
Research’’), some additional tubing was made., Two
ingots of a 48.2% Cr—51.8% Fe alloy and two ingots
of o 45% Fe~40% r-15% Ni dlloy were vacuum
cast into 1]/2-in.-did ingots 6 in. long. These ingots
were then hot rolled in an air atmosphere at 1250°C
to rod 5/B in. in diameter. After onnealing at 1100°C
for 2 hr and quenching, the rod was readily machin-
able info tubing.

The transformation from the ferrite to the sigma
phose will be accomplished by aging at 1425°F,
Two of the tubes (Fe-Cr) were cold swaged 12% so
that the effect of cold swaging on the distribution
of the sigma phase could be determined.

Boron Carbide Shielding

The experimental fabrication of !fs-in.-fhick shield
pieces by warm pressing boron carbide bonded with
copper or silver has been discontinued in favor of
the fabrication of pieces molded with nonmetallic
bonding material by cold pressing followed by
sintering to develop the desired properties. Non-
metallic bonding materials that would be suitable
from nuclear considerations and would be stoble af
the expected service temperature include sodium
silicate, silica, silicon nitride, and boric oxide.
Arrangements are being made to secure samples of
these materials for compatibility tests with Inconel
under operating conditions.

124

The density of the proposed shield pieces is to
be about 1.8 to 1.9 g/cm? of B ,C, equivalent to 1.4
to 1.5 g/cm?® of boron. They would be molded in
the form of equilateral triangles or diamond shapes,
2 to 3 in. on a side, so as to cover a sphere with
an integral number of pieces,

Additional tests of the compatibility of Incone!
with pure boron carbide are being made. Previous
tests indicated the formation of a diffusion layer
5 mils thick in a 100-hr test ot the operating temper-
ature of 1500°F,

Tubular Fuel Elements

Twelve tubular fuel elements are being prepared
for further drawing experiments at Superior Tube
Company. They are being assembled with high-
fired UQ, in.the 30- to 55-p particle size range, as
well as with very fine UO,, and with prealloyed
and elemental stainless steel and iron core matrixes.

Plans are also being made to try hot swaging of
the tubes in an attempt to reduce stringer formation
in the cores by reducing the amount of cold working.

cessful if bonding to the mandre! can be prevented

Metallurgy Division

The fluoride-to-sodium intermediate heat ex-
changer, which in a life test failed after 1680 hr in
cyclic service in the temperature range 1080 to
1500°F, was examined metallographically. All the
tube-to-header joints were manually heliarc welded,
and tests showed the heat exchanger to be helium
leak-tight before assembly into the test rig.

Visual examination indicated the presence of 19
fissures in the tube-to-header welds in two of the
three adjacent headers at the hot sodium inlet end.
The probable progressive propagation of these
fissures is shown in Figs. 7.14, 7.15, and 7.16,
The fissure shown in Fig. 7.16 probably extends to
the surface of the weld, If so, there was a leak in
the system at this point. It seems likely that dif-
ferential thermal exponsion between the tubes and
the casing caused stress concentrations at the
roots of the tube-to-header welds.

8. HEAT TRANSFER AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES

H. F. Poppendiek

Reactor Experimental Engineering Division

The enthalpies and heat capacities of NoF-ZrF -
UF, (65-15-20 mole %) were determined; the heat
capacity in the solid state over the temperature
range 90 to 614°C was found to be 0.17 cal/g-°C,
and the heat capacity in the liquid state over the
temperature range 653 to 924°C was found to be
0.20 cal/g-°C. The enthalpies and heat capacitiés
of LiF-NqF-UF4 (57.6-38.4-4.0 mole %) were also
obtained; the heat capacity in the solid state over
the temperature range 97 to 594°C was found fo
be 0.23 cal/g-°C, and in the liquid state over the
range 655 to 916°C it was found to be (.53
cal/g°C. The thermal conductivities of three
fluoride mixtures in the solid state at normal
temperatures were determined. The conductivity
of NaF~KF—UF4 (46.5-26.0-27.5 mole %) was 0.7
Btu/hr-ft? (°F/#), that for KF-LiF-NaF-UF, (43.5-
44.5-10,9-1.1 mole %) was 2.0 Btu/hr-ft?2 (°F/ft),
and that for LEF-KF-UF4 (48.0-48.0-4.0 mole %)
was 1.4 Btu/hr-f12 (°F/ft). A new electrical con-
ductivity device has been constructed and has
been successfully checked with molten salts of
known conductivity.

Additional forced-convection heat transfer meas-
urements of molten NaF-KF-LiF (11.5-42.0-46.5
mole %) have been made. Measured thermal con-
ductivities and thicknesses of insoluble deposits
on the inner walls of Inconel heat transfer tubes
made it possible to calculate the thermal re-
sistance of the deposit. The calculated value was
in good agreement with values previously deduced
from the heat transfer measurements. A device
for studying the rates of growth of tube-wall de-
posits has been successfully tested with a simple
heat transfer salt. A hydrodynamic flow system
to be used for studying the reflector-moderated
reactor flow structure has been tested. A mathe-
matical study of the temperature structure in can-
verging and diverging channel systems that duct
fluids with volume heat sources has been made.
A study of wall-cooling requirements in circu-
lating-fuel reactors was made.

produced by the Stable Isotope Research and Pro-
duction Division by reduction of a high quality
fluoride which was prepared by the ORSORT group
from RbF furnished by the Materials Chemistry
Division.

In order to obtain more accurate viscosity data
it was decided to initiate a program of refining
viscometry techniques. In particular, the influence
of fluid density on calibrations of both the ro-
tational and the capillary devices is being studied.
Easily hondled fused salts are being used as
calibrating fluids. The present studies indicate
that some of the old calibration curves, which were
based on low-density calibrating liquids, were
shifted by about 30%. This means that some of
the previously reported viscosity measurements are
about 30% high. :

Becaouse of significant improvements made in
fluoride preporation ond handling, the mixtures
which are now being obtained from the Materials
Chemistry Division are exiremely pure, and they
no longer cause the difficulties encountered in the
early stages of the project, such as fouling of
equipment and variations in physical character-
istics. No doubt some of the earlier viscosity
measurements were high because of the impurities
in the materials.

The experimental current-potential conductivity

the values reported in the literature.

As predicted, the effects of polarization within
this cell were greatly reduced by the use of the
alternate method.® This reduction in the effect

of polarization was further substantiated by the
small observable increase of conductivity with
frequency in contrast to the usual large depend-
ence of conductivity upon frequency, as observed
in the low-resistance conductivity cell. The
measurements on KNO. were obtained during a
single run without the necessity of having to
replatinize the electrodes after each determination.
A refinement of this current-potential cell which
will permit measurements of greater accuracy is
now under way.

ously by an alternate method, were found to be in

A study of the heat transfer phenomena which
occur when a water-cocled and -moderated solid-

critical has been undertaken. The time required
for generation of steam in water which is initially
below the boiling point will be determined. The
effects of water temperature, rate of power in-
crease, air concentration, and surface condition
will be investigated.

mental apparatus has been assembled and tested.
Satisfactory operation has been achieved. The
transient-power generator consists of 100 thy-

FLUID FLOW STUDIES FOR CIRCULATING-

Reactor Experimental Engineering Divisieon

The flow system for the hydrodynamic studies of
the reflector-moderated reactor core, shown sche-
matically in Fig. 8.3, has been fabricated, as-
sembled, and tested. A detailed sketch of the test
section is also shown in Fig. 8.3. Since it will
be necessary to insert, photograph, and then re-
move a coordinate grid from time to time, the
system was designed so that it could be readily
assembled and disassembled. The cores are po-
sitioned and supported by a brass sleeve, which
was attached to the test section support along its
center line before it was machined. The sleeve
was carefully bored and lopped so that the shafts
protruding downward from the cores would fit with
minimum clearance and yet loosely enough so that
they could be removed by hand. The upper surface
of the test section support flange was machined
perpendicular to the center line of the brass
sleeve. This arrangement permits accurate align-
ment of the core within the Plexiglas test section
without supporting members in or ahead of the test
region. Attempts are currently being made to
obtain some preliminary fluid flow information for
the reflector-moderated reactor core for the straight
entrance condition shown in Fig. 8.3 by photo-
graphing particle flow through the Plexiglas test
section.

The phosphorescent flow-visualization system,
which was described previously,!! has been further
modified. The ZnCd sulfide phosphor has been
replaced by a ZnS (Cu-activated) phosphor whose
luminosity was found to be greater after excitation.

proved so that higher Reynolds numbers are now
attainable, and a diverging lucite channel has
been constructed. Some of the flow features, such
as asymmetry, flow separation, and the effect of
entrance lengths, are to be observed for different
entrance configurations in such channel systems.

HEAT TRANSFER STUDIES FOR CIRCULATING-
FUEL REACTORS

H. F. Poppendiek L. D. Palmer

Reactor Experimental Engineering Division

The classical hydrodynamics study, conducted
by Nikuradse,'? of converging and diverging
channels was reviewed. It is felt that some of
the fundamental flow features observed in con-
verging and diverging channel systems will alsc
exist in the reflector-moderated reactor. The
results obtained by Nikuradse indicate that for
the case of turbulent flow in convergent channels
the flow becomes more stable or less turbulent in
nature and that the eddy ditfusivities are signifi-
cantly lower than in a parallel-plate channel
system. For the case of turbulent, symmetrical
flow in diverging channels the tlow is found to
be more turbulent than in the parallel-plate system.
When the total channel angle of a divergent system
is increased beyond 8 deg, asymmetrical flow re-
sults. For o 10-deg angle, a thin, low-velocity
layer of fluid flowing in a reverse direction to the
main stream is noted near one of the channel
walls. This separation phenomenon becomes more
pronounced at larger channel angles.

Some radial temperature distributions were calcu-
lated in the established-tlow region of a few con-
verging and diverging flow channel systems con-
taining volume heat sources within the ducted
fluide The experimentel velocity and eddy dif-
fusivity data obtoined by Nikuradse were used in
the analyses. The results indicated that wall-fluid
temperature differences can be significantly higher
in converging flow channels than in parallel-plate
systems; the converse is frue for symmetrical
diverging flow channels. Asymmetrical divergent
flow passages are difficult to analyze at this time

However, it should be emphasized
that even in the UF ,-bearing capsules, the ap-

could be due to experimental difficulties.

Inspection of the previously described LITR in-

MTR STATIC CORROSION TESTS

W. E. Browning G. W. Keilholtz
Solid State Division

A new series of capsules was irradiated in the
MTR to compare NaF-ZirF, fuels containing UF,
with those containing UF,. The property to be
compared is the effect of fission on static cor-

rosion of Incone! by the fuels at 1500°F. The
series includes five capsules containing 1,79
mole % UF,, 49.3 mole % ZrF,, and 48.9 mole %
NaF and five capsules containing 1.74 mole %
UF,, 48.2 mole % ZrF,, and 50.1 mole % NaF.
Analyses are being run to confirm the purity of the
UF; with respect to UF, contamination. For
every capsule, there will be an out-of-pile control
capsule. Each fuel generates 1100 w/cm® in the
A-38 position in the MTR,

Six capsules have been irradiated for the speci-
fied two-week period. Five have been received
at ORNL after irradiation; three of them have been
opened and two have been examined - one con-
taining UF ; and one containing UF ,. Bothcapsules
had been irradiated with the metal-liquid interface
at 1500 + 50°F., The UF;-bearing capsule had
experienced one temperature excursion to 1660 +
50°F for less than 30 sec, but the temperature of
the UF ,-bearing capsule never exceeded 1550 +
50°F. The fuel in each capsule was frozen two or
three times during its history. No evidence of
corrosion or film could be seen in the UF j-bearing
Inconel There was subsurface void
formation in the UF ;-bearing Inconel capsule to a
depth of about 2 mils. No intergranular corrosion
or concentration of voids at the grain boundaries
was evident,

Analytical samples of the irradiated fuel were
taken with two sizes of drills. The uranium concen-

Analyses for iron, chromium, and nickel gave the

to 0.05 wt %; Cr, less than 1074 wt %. There were
no significant differences in the final iron, nickel,

not been completed.

It would be unwise to draw conclusions on the
basis of only one pair of samples; however, if
these first results are confirmed in future capsules,
UF, fuels may be considered quite desirable as
far as radiation-induced corrosion is concerned.
Two UF;-bearing capsules and two UF ;-bearing
capsules in this series will be irradiated for six
weeks each to amplify the apparent differences in
the effects of UF; and UF, on Inconel. It is inter-
esting to note that the UF ; capsule in this series is
the first one run in the MTR and the first one run at
800 w/cm? or greater that has not shown a tendency
toward intergranular corrosion. - Whether the differ-
ence between eorlier UF -bearing capsules and
the one in this series is due to improved temper-
ature control or to uranium concentration effects
will be determined by additional irradiations.

FISSION PRODUCT CORROSION STUDY

C. C. Webster G. W. Keilholtz
Solid State Division

Steps are being taken to perform corrosion tests
out-of-pile with irradiated fuel in order to separately
study the effects on Inconel of fission-product
concentration and of Inconel irradiation.

A water-cooled facility for irradiation of solid
fuel was constructed and has been installed in
position C-46 of the LITR., The unperturbed
thermal flux is on the order of 4 x 1073, An Inconel
tube has been constructed for casting solid bars
of fuel 1 in, long and 0.1 in. in diameter. The
solid bars of fuel will be transferred to Inconel
capsules for irradiation. The capsule has been
constructed so that it can be welded shut without
the bars being melted and can be reopened in the
hot cell for transfer of the fuel to the corrosion
test capsule.

Upon completion of an out-of-pile heating cycle,
the test capsule will be opened in the hot cell.
The fuel will be drilled out and divided into three
samples: a portion for petrographic study to detect
any oxidation or reduction, a portion for mass
spectrographic  study to determine burnup, and
a portion for chemical analysis of the fuel. The
capsule will be slit on the remote slitting machine
described below for a metallographic study. At
least two concentric samples can be taken from a
capsule of this size by remote means.

capsule the corrosion pattern was not consistent
over the length of the capsule but appeared to be a
function of the longitudinal temperature gradient.
One method of obtaining a longitudinal section
would be to grind away half of the capsule on the
milling machine. However, by such a methed it
would be difficult to ascertain that a section
through the diameter of the capsule had been made.
Also, the milling operation would create a serious
contamination problem,

The method being used consists in passing the
capsule longitudinally by a 10-mil-thick silicon
carbide fine-grit wheel and thus slitting the cap-
sule down the center. The capsule is clamped
into a vise and then fed into the wheel by means of
a mechanical linkage which is to be replaced by a
variable-speed motor and o contact cutoff switch,
When the capsule is put into the gripping adapter
in the vise, it is automatically aligned so that the
wheel will cut in the plane of o diameter through
the capsule, By making different gripping adapters,
various sizes of tube can be slit lengthwise. Thus
far the apparatus has been used on only MTR-type
fluoride fuel capsules (0.100-in.-ID and 0.200-in.~
0OD); it has worked very satisfactorily. :

Since the abrasive wheel has a rubber base, it
must be kept cool. The darea around the cut must
also be kept cool to prevent any high thermal
stresses from affecting the corrosion results. The
wheel and specimen are over a tray and are covered
with a splash shield so that a liquid coclant can
be used. The coolant level is always kept above
the bottom edge of the abrasive wheel so that by
cutting upward into the specimen the coolant is
carried into the cut; therefore the specimen need
not be in the coolant, Carbon tetrachloride is
used as the coolant because it does not react with
the fluoride fuel at high temperatures. It is forced
into the tray from outside ‘the hot cell through
Tygon tubing by air pressure. The tray and splash
shield are attached to the mount for the vise and
they move with the specimen.

Once installed within the hot cell, the remotely
operated tube-slitting machine can be used with
ease in cutting longitudinal sections from various
sizes of tubing. Thicker abrasive wheels can be
used for heavier walled tubing. The advantages of
this method of cutting are that it permits visual
observation of the amount of fuel left on the tube
walls, it permits observation of constrictions
without the necessity of removing or disturbing the

material causing the trouble, it gives o well-exposed
surface for chemically removing the last traces of
fuel, it permits a cut to he made through the bottom
plug of the capsule so that an examination can be
made for crevice corrosion, and it leaves nearly
one half of the capsule for further and more com-
plete study, if desired. After the fuel is removed
chemically without attacking the metal wall, the
specimen can be electroplated so that the fuel-

samples of the irradiated fuel for the concentration
of the original components ond for the major con-

Analytical Chemistry Division for analysis. Work
on the necessary transfer shields has been coordi-
nated with the design and construction of the lead
barrier being provided in the analytical chemistry
hot cells to improve transfer conditions and to
reduce personnel exposure.

Two transfer carriers weighing 150 Ib each and
giving 2 in, of lead shielding have been constructed
and are now in use. FEach carrier holds four 30-ml
bottles that are held in place by spring clamps.
A motor-driven decapper for removing the bottle
cap and a remotely controlled pipet thai can be
lowered into the bottle are provided. The bottles
may be inserted into the carrier within the cells
and can be left in the caorrier during all sample
removal operations. The whole unit moy then be
returned to the hot cells for reuse.

Two lead storage units weighing 450 |b each and
giving 3 in. of lead shielding were also built and
are available for use when all the transfer carriers
are in use. The lead storage units have a capacity
of four 50-ml volumetric flasks and can be loaded
within the master-slave cells.

ANALYSIS OF iRRADIATED FLUORIDE
FUELS FOR URANIUM

M. T. Robinson G. W. Keilholtz

One of the regular steps in in-pile static cor-
rosion testing of fluoride fuels has been the anal-
ysis of the irradiated fuel for uranium. However,
there are several major problems connected with

sampling operations, described previously,'s?

which have never been fully resolved. In the

small chips of metal, either from the capsule or
the drill, to get into the fuel sample. To minimize

stages discussed above foreign material may have
been introduced info some of the samples. Such
contaminants make the resulting uranium analyses

QV{G

The samples obtained for chemical analysis
have, at times, been very small, often being as
small as 10 mg. They are weighed in tared weighing
bottles on a conventional chain-type analytical
balance, and, since they are so small, the precision
of weighing is about 4% instead of the usual
negligible amount. This lack of precision results
in an obnormally high uncertainty in the uranium
analyses. After being weighed, the samples are
dissolved and the solutions are made up to volume
in the hot cells. The resulting solutions often
contain as little as 500 ppm of uranium, Such
high dilution is undesirable, since the titer may
change appreciobly on fong standing. It seems
reasocnable to conclude that the uncertainty in
uraitium analyses may be as high as +5% or more,
even for the usually precise (+2%) potentiometric
titration, An increase of ten times in sample size
(easily attainable) would restore this technique
to its normal precision.

trographic analysis. The samples taken are weighed
by the analysts on a microbalance to alleviate the
effect of small sample size. However, the handling
of the very small crucibles in the hot cells is riot
so delicate an operation as might be desired. The
possibilities of contamination entering the sample
are high.

No highly useful conclusions hove emerged from
much of the analytical work done in the past,
probably because of the difficulties described
above. Recently, however, marked improvement
has been made as a result of continved efforts to
improve sampling techniques, sample sizes, and
handling procedures, ond uranium analyses have
been carried out in a satisfactory manner. Since
the analytical results obtained recently show thot
no measurable segregation of uranium takes place,
the procedure of taking more than one sample from
each capsule will be abandoned. This will allow
very much larger samples to be obtained, will
make the analyses more sure, and will minimize the
effects of foreign additions to the salt.

HIGH-TEMPERATURE CHECK VALVE TESTS

W. R. Willis G. W. Keilholtz
Solid State Division

As part of the development program for a small
in-pile pump loop for operation in a berylium
A-piece in the LITR, an attempt was made to
develop a high-temperature check-valve pump,
Such a pump has the advantage of being o compact,
completely sealed unit.

A test rig was run with Inconel, stainless steel,
and Stellite 25 check balls. None of these materials
gave successful tests. Time of operation before
failure varied from 30 min for the Inconel to 2 hr
for the stainless steel. Except with the stainless
steel balls, operation of the valves was not con-
tinuous; they would occasionally stick in both
open and closed positions. When failure occurred,
it was abrupt, and therefore sticking of the valves
was indicated rather than o gradual stoppage of the
system,

Tests were conducted on an RPM meter, bearings,
and o small electric motor as o part of the de-
velopment of o loop for insertion in an LITR A-
piece. In order to drive the pump, it is desirable
to use a variable-spesed electric motor and to align
the shaft with lubricated bearings. Also, o record
of shaft speed would be desivable, The entire
motor assembly will be just above the upper grid
guide in the LITR and in an estimoted thermal

ORNL Grophite Reactor provided a comparable flux
intensity and was used for these tests,

The in-pile apparatus, with a single lower bearing
as in the second test, is shown in Fig. 9.3. A
motor was mounted in g horizontal position with
upper ond lower armature shaft bearings, In the
first test two lower bearings were used. The motor
and RPM meter were canned and inserted into
the center line of the reactor. The variables
measured were resistance of the motor winding,

the two components to make a 7-g solution in each.
Normal uranium was used. Two capsules were
irradiated in appropriate secondary containers in
a water-cooled hole in the ORNL Graphite Reactor
at a thermal flux of 6 x 10'7 neutrons/cm?.sec for
63 hr. This exposure corresponds to 25 times the
fission density expected in the shielding experi-
ment with enriched uranium, The capsules were
opened in a special gos manifold, and the gas
pressures were determined. The pressure inside
the irradiated capsules was shown to have been
greater than 50 and less than 100 psia. The pres-
sure inthe unirradiated capsule was not perceptibly

A loop for circulating fluoride fuel was inserted
in hole HB-2 of the LITR and filled with fluoride
fuel NaF-ZrF -UF, (62.5-12,5-25 mole %) during a
protracted reactor shutdown. The pump was started
as soon as sufficient fuel had been added, but
circulation of the fluoride mixture became erratic
after 5 to 10 min and finally stopped completely.
Fluoride fumes in the off-gas line from the jacket
around the pump indicated a leak,® and therefore
the loop was removed before the reactor was started.

The loop was carefully disassembled to aveid
loss of uranium, since over 5 kg of enriched fuel
mixture had been used to charge the loop. Recovery
of the fuel from the ‘‘nosepiece’’ at the in-pile
end of the loop had to be carried out in a hot cell
because of neutron activation acquired when the
unfilled loop was exposed to reactor flux before
the fuel was added. The leak was found in-the
weld joining the loop tubing to the discharge nipple
ot the bottom of the pump bowl. Complete breaking
of the weld occurred probably during disassembly
of the loop or during cutting of the pump jacket,
rather than while the pump was in operation,

Before insertion in the reactor the jacket for
enclosing the loop and the pump in an inert atmos-
phere was tested for gas tightness., The loop,
with the pump superstructure replaced by a blank
flange, was vocuum tested at 800 to 1000°F with
a helium leak detector. After the loop was inserted
in the reactor, it was pressure tested at 1200 to
1500°F ot 16 psig, and there was no perceptible
loss in pressure over a l-hr period, even though
the pump superstructure with its rotating shaft seal
was in place.

have been redesigned for the second loop to provide
a filling and drain line. This will permit charging
the loop with a non-uranium-bearing flucride mixture,
circulating it at operating temperature, and draining
it before the loop is inserted into the reactor. The
danger of tube rupture becouse of expansion of the
fuel on melting necessitates the draining and
refilling feature, if operating tests are to be carried
out. The necessary changes in the pump shield
to accommodate the drain and fill line are being
made.

The Metallurgy Division will supervise all critical
welding and has provided specifications for an
improved weld joint developed for Incone! tubing.
The components fabricated previously for the
second loop are being changed to conform to the
specifications for the new weld joints. A new
flange for closing the rear of the jacket has been
made in order to give more space for making pipe
connections to the large air lines required for the
heat exchanger.

During installation of the loop in the reactor an
unexpectedly long time was required to connect
heater leads, thermocouple leads, and air, water,
and helium piping in the confined space available
between the shielding and the instrument pane!,

The piping at the reacter face is being revised
to facilitate connection when the second loop is
ready for insertion so that installation may be
performed more ropidly. Modifications are also
being made to remove lag in the flow alarms for
the jacket cooling water, The oil systemfor cooling
the pumps is being rebuilt to incorporate more
reliable pumps ond improved flow and alarm instrue
ments.

A hydraulically operated door to match the with-
drawal shield has been installed in o wall of a hot
cell in preparation for handling the loop after
A horizontal band saw has been modi-
fied for almost complete remote operation and is
being installed in the hot cell. Other remote han-
dling tools for disassembling the loop have been
made and are being tested.

ORNL GRAPHITE REACTOR SODIUM-INCOKNEL
LLOOP

W. E. Brundage W. W. Parkinson
Solid State Division

Metallographic examination was completed on an
Inconel loop which had circulated sodium in hole

142

58-H of the ORNL Graphite Reactor for 218 hr with
the irradiated section at 1500°F. The unperiurbed
thermal flux in this hole is about 7 x 1011, and
the flux above 1 ev is a factor of 10 lower. There
was no evidence of radiation induced corrosion of
the Inconel. The temperature of the pump cell
section was held between 1025 and 1100°F, and
that of the line entering the reactor was somewhat
higher; the temperature of the line emerging from
the reactor was about 1500°F. Before insertion
in the reactar the loop had been operated at 800
to 1000°F for 80 hr while sedium was circulated
through the loop and through a bypass filter circuit
connected to the loop.

CREEP AHMD STRESS-CORROSION TESTS

W. W. Davis J. C. Wilson
N. E. Hinkle J. C. Zukas
Solid State Division

Development of a suitable apparatus for in-pile
stress-corrosion experiments hos been slow be-
cause of difficulty in securing constant hegt-
transfer rotes from the fuel to a heat sink where
the fission heat can be removed. In the design
shown in Fig. 9.7, fission heat is conducted from
the fuel through the stressed specimen wall to a
sodium-filled annulus. The sodium acts as an
efficient heat conductor that exerts no constraint
upon the deformation of the specimen tube as it
creeps under applied stress. Part of the fission
heat is removed by gaseous convection at the outer
surface of the sodium-containing chamber and part
by conduction through o metal ring to a water
jacket. Simpler designs in which the sodium was
contained in o constant-diameter annuius did not
permit good temperature control. The temperature
gradient that resulted from simulated fission heat
input at the bottom and heat abstraction at the
top caused heated sodium to rise discontinuously
in the annulus, and temperature excursions of
100°F in 1 sec were not uncommon. A substantial
temperature gradient (500 to 800°F per in.) is
required to meet headroom requirements in the
experimental hole and to prevent sodium distil-
lation out of the annulus.

Several designs of the sodium annulus were
tried, such as baffles and spirals, ond ratios of
outside-to-inside sodium-annulus diameters were
varied but did not result in a constant temperature
gradient, The apporatus shown in Fig, 9.7 appears
to operate satisfactorily, but more operating time

must be accumulated before it will be certain that
sodium distillation is not taking place in sufficient
quantities to cause trouble.

In the apparatus a tubular Inconel specimen con-
taining 0.2 g of NaF-Zer-UFd {53.5-40.0-6.5 mole
%) in the fuel chamber attached to the fixed base
is eccenirically loaded through a lever arm by a
weight. A stress pattern is produced across the
horizontal cross section which varies from a
maximum compressive stress.  Surrounding the
specimen is a sodium coolant chamber with baffies
which reduce the magnitude of the thermal-con-
vection currents and allow closer control of the
specimen temperature. A furnace helps to maintain
the temperature at 1500°F throughout the test.
Two thermocouple wells project into the sodium

chomber to a position neor the walls of the speci-
men at the neutral axis. A double-walled, con-
centric, sodium fill line, with only the outer tube
welded to the chamber, and a vacuum exhaust tube
complete the apparatus. All surfaces in confact
with the fuel and sodium are made of Inconel.

The assembly is hydrogen fired for 1 he at
1750°F, filled with fuel, and welded in a dry
box wnder purified helium. The other parts of
the container are welded into subassemblies, hy-
drogen fired, and then welded together, with helium
backing up the welds. The lever arm and weight
are adjusted and spot welded onto the specimen,
and the chomber covers are welded into place.
Betore the rig is filled with sodium, it is filled
with NoK and heated to 1000°F to remove  any

with the NaK ond leaves the surfaces clean ond

any oxides of sodium that may be formed when the
connection to the test rig is made. Once the con-
nection is made, the apparatus is evacuated and
the sodium is melted and forced into the chamber
by helium pressure through the valve; a combi-
nation of high surface tension and back pressure
made filling the chaember somewhat more difficult
without this procedure. For the bench tests, in
sticks of sodium were used, the filled
chamber was heated while a vacuum was pulled
on the system, and a rise in pressure was noted

sodium hydride. It remains to be seen whether
such a procedure is necessary to ensure the purity
of the sodium now available. The dry-box work
is completed by cutting the outer fill tube, re-
moving the inner (contaminated) tube, and crimping
and welding both the fill and exhaust tubes.

The entire assembly is welded into a stainless
steel water jacket furnished with Kovar seals and
a capillary tube through which helium flows
throughout the test. A probe beneath the weight
cuts off the current to the furnace at a prede-
termined deflection of the lever arm and indicates
the time required for a given degree of deformation.
A gravity ‘‘tilt"" indicator aids in plumbing the
specimen in the exposure can. A base plate with
a conical cup furnishes a well for the sodium in
case of rupture during operation, A suitable safety
system is being developed.

Approval by the LITR Experiment Review Com-
mittee is being withheld until additional tests are
made on the compatibility of sodium with the
various component materials it might contact if
a rupture occurred at the test temperaiure. Several
tests aimed at a qualitative determination of the
speed of reaction and the heat generated by such
reactions should be completed within a short time.

After an irradiation period of from two to six
weeks in hole HB-3 of the LITR and a suitable
decay period, the specimen is to be sectioned by
the remote metallography group and examined for
stress-carrosion effects.

144

Bench tests on the specimen tube alone are
under way with the outside surface in air, The
inside of the tubes contains either air, helium, or
NaF-ZrF ,-UF, (50-46-4 mole %). An atmosphere
chamber has been built for testing four specimens
simultaneously in vacuum or any desired atmos-
phere. One 200-hr test has been completed on
barren NcF-ZrF4-UF4 (50-46-4 mole %) at 1500°F
and about 1500 psi. No stress dependence of
corrosion was found; another specimen was tested
for 400 hr but has not yet been examined. A
melting and overturning technique for removing
fluoride fuel from the section that is to be ex-
amined metallographically has been successful;
this will greatly simplify handling of irradiated
capsules.

The MTR tensile creep rig is undergoing final
testing and is scheduled for irradiation tests on
Inconel in Qctober.

Work was continued on the examination of the
solid-type fuel sandwiches of interest to the Pratt
& Whitney Aircraft Division. In addition to the
two experiments mentioned previously,® six other
specimens have been exaomined. The results on
three of them (capsules 1-4, 1-6, 1-7) have been
published.” A report covering the other three
capsules (1-5, 1-8, 1-9) is being prepared. Ex-
amination of the eight capsules processed to date
has indicated greater resistance to cracking and
core-clad separation upon bending of the stainless-
steel-matrix samples than upon bending of the
iron-matrix samples, better resistance to cracking
upon bending of the large UQ, particle size core
than upon bending of the smaller particle size
core, and a greafer increase in hardness upon
irradiation of the small particle size core than
upon irradiation of the larger particle size core.

FISSION-FRAGMENT ANNEALING STUDIES

M. J. Feldmon W. Porsley
Solid State Division

Because of interest in the possibility of the
removal of the radiation damage to fuel plates by
annealing, a preliminary study was wndertaken.
The eight samples in Pratt & Whitney capsule
1-9 (four were small particle size, <3-u UG, and
tour were large particle size, 15- to 44 UO.Q)
were selected for the study. Cne sample from each
group (large and small particle size) was examined
after the following treatment: (1) as irradiated,
(2) 900°F anneal for 24 hr, (3) 1100°F anneal for
24 hr, and (4) 1400°F anneal for 24 hr,
showing the results of this preliminary study is
shown in Fig. 9.8, The conclusion drawn fron:
this initial study is that a portion of the neutron

damage to the samples has been annealed out.
Since the full annealing temperature for type 347
stainless steel is about 1800°F (for complete
removal of the effects of cold work), a complete
anneal for neutron damage at 1400°F was not
expected. For the core, where the major portion
of the damage is by fission fragments, it is felt
that the curve shows a reduction in hardness be-
cause of a partial anneal of the neutron damage
with no reduction in the fragment damage. An
attempt will be made to determine the anneal nec-
essary to remove all the neutron damage from this
type of material and, if possible, the fission-
fragment annealing temperatures.

is availoble in the literature on the usual times
and temperatures for Inconel grain growth, but
because of the nature of the experiment, with its
possibilities of local short-time hot spots in the
fuel, this study was initiated. Figure 9.9 is a

the definite temperature dependence of the carbide

could be produced. Details of the experiment have

Fission probes with different fissionable ma-
terials were used to maoke neutron flux traverses
in MB-3 of the MTR. The fissionable materials
used included U238, Y236 Np237  gnd Th2%2,
whose fission threshold energies span the energy
region between Y% and 2 Mev. The data from these
traverses will be used with the results from acti-
vations in HB-3 of other, nonfissionable, threshold
detectors that are in the process of being irradi-
ated.

After measurements have been completed in HB-3
with the hole empty, several inches of beryllium
will be introduced into the hole in such a way as
to change the energy distribution of the trans-
mitted neutrons. The new energy distribution will
then be measured, and materials will be irradiated
in both moderated and unmoderated neutron spectra.
An attempt will then be made to correlate spectra
and radiation damage.'?

The primary analytical problem continues to be
the separation and determingtion of trivelent ond
tetravalent uranium in both NaZers- and NaF-Kf-
LiF-base fuels. A successful potentiometric titra-
tion of UF, in molten NaZrF . with metallic zir-
conium was accomplished by meons of polarized
platinum electrodes. The observed end point
occurred ot a weight of titrant which corresponded
to one-half an equivalent of zirconium metal per
mole of UF,, This stoichiometry indicates reduc-
tion of UF, to a mixed oxidation state. Polaro-
grophic studies of uranium fluorides in reactor fuels
dissolved in molten ammonium formate ot 125°C
were initiated. Preliminary experiments revealed
that tetravalent uranium was not reduced at the
dropping-mercury electrode,
formote appeors to be o useful solvent for fluoride-
base fuels containing various oxidation states of
uranium. The conversicn of UF, to UCIH in fluoride
fuels was shown to be quantitative when the fuel
was heated with boron trichloride at 400°C for
90 min. Trivalent uranium fluoride is converted to
UCl; under these conditions. The solubility of
UF, in NaAICI, was found to be 18 mg/g at 200°C
as contrasted to a solubility of UF, of less than
1 mg/g. Molten NaAlCl, is expected to dissolve
tetravalent uranium selectively from the fuels.

Oxidation-Reduction Titrations in Fused Salts

A, S. Meyer, Jr.
Analytical Chemistry Division

Experiments were carried out to determine whether
the equivalence point of a titration in which UF
dissolved in a molten fluoride fuel solvent is re-
duced by the addition of small increments of an
electrodeposition metal could be observed by one
of the conventional electrometric techniques, The
first system studied involved the reduction of UF,
in NaZrF . by zirconium metal according to the
proposed reaction

AUF, + Zr° > 4UF, + ZrF, .

Since no insulating material which is compatible
with molten NaZrF. was available, it was not
possible to devise o reference elecirode for meas-
urement of the potentials of the solutions, Accord-
ingly, polarized platinum electrodes were selected
as indicating clectrodes. In order to obtain more
information about the nature of the polarization
phenomena, the area of one of the electrodes was
made approximately 80 times that of the other.
Thus, since the current density at the smaller
electrode waos 80 times as great as thot ot the
larger, the potential difference between the elec-
was approximately equal to that of the
smaller electrode. By reversing the direction of
the polarizing current, it was possible to determine
the potential at the cathode and at the anode,

The solution of UF, in NaZrF g was contained in
a 25-ml platinum crucible which was placed in the
helium-filled quartz liner of o pot furnace, Agi-
tation was accomplished by means of a mechani-
cally driven platinum stirrer which was constructed
of 0.05in.-dia platinum wire, Additions o the
solution were made through o quartz tube which
extended from the top of the liner to a point about
1 in. above the melt.

In pure NaZrF. the onode was more strongly
polarized than the cothode. At polarizing currents
of 80 pa the potential of both electrodes exceeded

trodes

1 v. Approximately ]/2 hr was required for the
electrodes to reach equilibrium. Platinum elec-
trodes could not be oppreciably polarized in NaF-
KF-LiF-base fuels,

When UF , wos added to the molten NaZrF, the

potential decreased rapidly. For a solution which

contained 1.25 mole % UF the potential of both
electrodes was approximately 300 mv, with no
significant difference between the potentials of the
cathode and ancde.

During the early part of the titration of the molten
fluoride mixture with zirconium metal, the potential
of the cathode decreased to values less thon 10 mv
and remained constant throughout the titration. At
the same time the potential of the anode increased
rapidly ond attained potentials in excess of 1 v
before the end point of the titration was reached,
When an equivalence point was reached, the poten-
tial of the anode decreased rapidly to about 50 mv
and then decreased gradually on further addition of

He also reported that anhydrous hexavalent uranium
gave no reduction wave until after an aging period
during which the compounds were reduced by the
ammonium formate to a lower valence state, probably
guadrivalent, |

Since it appeared that this techmque could be
appiied to the determination of tetravalent uranium
in the presence of large quantities of trivalent
uranium, expérimmfs were carried out to obtain
polarograms of solutions of UF ,
experiments it was found that UF,
ond NaF-KF- L:F base fuels dassoived readily i
molten ammonium formate ot 125°C to form green
solutions containing as much as 1 mg of uranium
per milliliter. Although UF, alone was found to be
much less soluble, UF; which had been fused with
NaZrF . was readily soluble, Similor relationships
were found when molten ammoniom acetate was
used as a solvent, :

No U(lV) reduction waves were obtained when
polarograms of solutions of UF, were recorded
immediately after dissolution, and no reduction
waves were  observed in the polarograms of a
sample of NaF-KF-LiF-base fuel that contained
both UF, and UF,. When these solutions were
gerated, a single reduction wave with a halk
wave potential of approximately ~0.2 v was ob-
served. The potential and the diffusion current of
this wave corresponded closely to those recorded
immediately after the dissolution of an equivalent
quantity of K;UO,F, in molten formate. Since the
U(IV) waves moy have been shifted to potentials
outside the range of the solvent (0 to ~0.9 v) by
the complexing action of the fluoride ions, oddi-
tional polarograms were token of solutions con-
taining UCi,.  Except for a small reduction wave
ot about —~0.2'v, no evidence of reduction was found,
The diffusion current of this wave was increased
by aeration to values corresponding to those ob-
tained for hexavalent uranium, and therefore the
increase was atiributed to the oxidation of UC!M
It appears that in molten ammonium formate no
oxidation state of uranium other thon hexavalent is
reduced ot the dropping-mercury electrode.

Conversion of UF,; and UF to the Respective
Chiorides with BCI3

A, S, Meyer, Jr. D. L. Manning
Anquhcal Chemlstry Division

It was reported previously? that, on the bas:s of
free-energy ' calevlations, UF,, UF, ZrF,, ‘and
NaF are quantitatively converted to the chlorides
when at equilibrium with boron trichloride. Since
the exchange reaction in organic solvents at moder-
ate femperdtures was found to be too slow for
analytical application, tests were carried out with
gaseous BCl, ot elevated temperatures. This tech-
nique offered an addifional advantage in that the
resulting chlorides couid be sepumfed by subllmu-
tion.

When o somple of NaZrF, UF: fuel was heated
in a stream of BCl, and hehum a‘t 350°C, the bulk
of the zirconium was sublimed as ZrCl, within 90
min, and all but fraces were removed ofier heating
for an additional hour at 450°C, It has been re-
ported? that uranium can be sublimed as Uucl, by
treating UF:‘i with BCl, af 600 to 650°C, but in
these tests only o small fraction of the UCl, was
volatilized - when the UC! -NaCl residue, which
fused at about 450°C, was heated to temperatures
as high as 750°C. ‘

Analyses of the residues showed that when the
conversion was carried out at 400°C for 90 min the
vranium in - the NoZrF UF samples was quanti-
tatively converted to UCl, ond that all the uranium
remained in the residue. When the conversion was
carried out at 500°C, 2%  of the uranium ‘was
volatilized, while at 750°C, 4% was volatilized.

When UF, samples were converted to UCI, by
this method, significant froctions of the uranium
were oxidized to UC|,, It is believed that this
oxidation will be eliminated when all traces of
oxidizing contaminants are removed from the gase-
ous reactants, &

and UF, to the corresponding chlorides,® it was
noted that UF , was dissolved much more readily
thon UF; by fused NoAICl,. Measurements of the
solubilities were carried out by equilibrating sam-
ples of the uranium fluorides with molten NaAICH,
for periods up to 5 hr, under an inert atmosphere,
followed by the separation of the undissolved
solids by filtration ond calculation of the solubility
from the concentration of uranium in the filtrate,

Solubilities of 18 and 16 mg of UF , per gram of
NaAICl, were found at 200 and 175°C, respectively.
However, the solubility of UF3 decreased from
> mg/g of NaAICl, at 225°C fo less than 1 mg/g at
200°C. Since UCI; was also found to be sparingly
soluble at the lower temperatures, the above values
are indicative of the true solubility of trivalent uro-
nium in this medium rather than of incomplete con-
version of the fluoride to chloride. At temperatures
lower than 200°C, molten NaAlCi‘i is expected to
dissolve tetravalent uranium selectively from UF,
which has been complexed by potassium fluoride in
the fuel.

Since all available UF; samples are contaminated
with tetravalent uranium, it has not been possible
to carry out accurate solubility measurements at
the lower temperatures by relying on the determina-
tion of total dissolved uranium. An apparatus has
been constructed for the determination of microgram
quantities of frivalent uronium in the filtrates by
hydrogen evelution, This apparatus, which is based
on the measurement of evolved gases at reduced
pressures, is now being calibrated against cou-
lometrically generated hydrogen. In order to carry
out dissolutions at lower temperatures, LiCI-AlCI
fluxes which melt at approximately 120°C have
been prepared.

In these tests the reaction time was held constant
at 2 hr and the temperafure was varied from 200 to
600°C, with the results shown in the following:

Temperoture Reactivity

200 30
300 100

At 300°C the reoction proceeds quantitatively as
written, At higher temperatures, however, the con-
centration of soluble uranium (UF4 in ammonium
oxalate) decreased rapidly from the theoretical
content with increasing temperature, probably as o
consequence of a further reaction of oxygen with
UF .

The experiment was then repeated with UF, and
oxygen. At 200°C the entire sample was soluble
in ammonium oxalate, as expected, which indicated
no oxide formation. At higher temperatures, a black
insoluble residue was formed upon dissolution of
The amount of
residue increased at higher temperatures from 11%
at 300°C to 27% at 600°C., The major portion of
the sample dissolved rapidly, and a yellow filtrate
was formed. It is to be noted that Kraus® reported
that the following reaction occurs ot 800°C:

The yellow color of the filtrate substantiates this
reaction in part, but there is no way of accounting
for the black residue, obviously an oxide of ura-

quantitatively to U,0g when ignited ot 900°C in

will be made. Further tests are planned at various

applicable to the ondlysis of NaF-KF(RbF)-LiF-
base reactor fuels.

Lithium. An indirect volumetric method for the
determination of lithium in the presence of the
large concentrations of sodium and potassium and/or
rubidium which are found in NaF-KF(RbF)-L.iF-base
fuels was developed. The method was designed
specifically to provide a rapid, and yet precise,
means of determining lithium. The alkali metals
are first separated from uranium and then converted
to chlorides. Lithium is extracted as the soluble
chloride salt by heating ot about 135°C with
2-ethylhexanol® until the slightly soluble salts
of sodium and potassium become *‘free-flowing”’
and no longer cling to the walls of the vessel,
These salts are removed by filtration, and then the
tiltrate is diluted with ethanol. The chloride in the
filtrate is titrated by the Volhard method,? and the
lithium concentration is calculated, The coefficient
of varigtion is 0.5% for 1 to 50 mg of lithium. A
topical report of this work is being written,

Potassium and Rubidium. Since the concentration
of either potassium or rubidium in NaF-KF(RbF}-
lLiF-base fuels is of the order of 30 wt %, the de-
termination of potassium or rubidium by means of
the flome photometer has been neither sufficiently
accurate nor precise, The conventional method for
this determination is the perchlorate separation !0
of potassiumor rubidium perchlorate from the sodium
and lithium salts in ethyl acetate. The methed is
satisfactory but requires considerable
operator time. |herefore the application of possible

solubility of potassium bitartrate before a decision
can bereached as to the applicability of this method
to NaF-KF-LiF-base fuels.

A second method under consideration is the use of
sodium ftetraphenyl boron'? as a reagent for the
direct determination of potassium, rubidium, and
cesium.  The potassium salt is precipitated in
aqueous acidic solution, filtered, dried at 110°C,
and weighed as potassium tetraphenylborate. The
method has the advantage of being simple and rapid,
and it has a favorable weight factor for potassium,
Themain interference in the use of tetraphenylboron
is the ammonium ion, The reagent is expensive,
but it is readily available at the present time,
Preliminary work on the solubilities of potassium,
rubidium, and cesium tetraphenylborates in non-
aqueous solvents has shown some interesting dif-
ferences in solubilities. The possibility of ex-
ploiting differential solubility as a means of
separating the salts is being explored, Acetyl-
acetone, diethylketone, and methy! isopropylketone
are three possible solvents for this separation,
The order of solubility in organic solvents has been
established as: KTPB > RbTPB > CsTPB (TPB =
tetraphenylboron).

Fluoride lon, The determinatian of fluoride ion
in fluoride fuels was previously conducted by the
pyrohydrolysis'® procedure which was particularly
successtul for NaZrF -base fuels. Alkali metal
fluorides, however, are resistant to pyrohydrolysis,
and thus considerable time, of the order of 3 to 4 hr,
is required to pyrohydrolyze completely 100 mg of
NoF-KF-LiF-base material.

Two alternative methods have been studied,
therefore, for opplication to the determination of
fluoride ion in NaF-KF-LiF-base materials. A pro-
cedure, which was formulated by Chilton, ' was
tested. In this procedure the fluoride ion is titrated
with a standard solution of aluminum (potassium
alum), and the resulting change in acidity is re-
corded. Considerable difficulties have been en-
countered, the foremost of which is the extremely
small change in pH at the equivalence point. The
method in its present form does not appear to be
applicable to this work.

of fluoride ion based on the decolorization of o

Qil Contamination in ARE Helium

G. Goldberg
Anolytical Chemistry Division

The contamination of the helium for the ARE with
oil from valves and fittings was checked before the
gas at the site was used, The method used for
these tests was to pass the gas through dual
scrubbing towers containing petroleum ether and
then to evaporate the ether to dryness and weigh
the residue. In the initial test on a tank car of
helium, 360 pg/ft3 was found. A tower containing
70 in.3 of charcoal was placed in the gas line, but
it had little effect in eliminating the oil. Further
tests on the same tank car showed that bleeding the
line before samples were taken markedly lowered
For example, in three
successive samples of 15.5 fi3 of gas each, the
contamination decreased from 100 to 10 ug/ft3.
These tests indicate that bieeding the line with
50 to 100 ft2 of gas before the equipment is coupled

3KF-UF ;, and the other is blue and is near KF.UF .
Only one binary phase is present in the NaF-UF,
system, and it is probably 3NaF.2UF,, Lithium
fluoride has not been found to combine with UF,
in either the binary system LiF-UF,, in the ternary

quarternary  system LiF-NaF-KF-UF,  Cesium
fluoride was found to form a complex with UF,,
with a composition near 3CsF-UF,, Some work was
done on the systems LiF-ZnF, and NaF-CsF, and
no binary compounds were found,

Part of a loop in which NaF-ZrF -UF, (50-46-4

Theoretical analyses have been made so that an
understanding of the air and ground scattering
measurements: at the Tower Shielding Facility could
be obtained and the attenuation in the side wall of
an aircraft crew shield could be determined. In
connection with the cir and ground scattering analy-
ses, special attention was given to the calculation
of the reduction of air scattering due to ground
interruption and to the effects of multiple scattering.
The gamma-ray slant penetration has been calcu-
lated for the side wall of an aircraft crew shield,
and the variation of radiation intensity throughout
the crew volume has been briefly explored.

SLANT PENETRATION OZF COMPOSITE
SLAB SHIELDS BY GAMMA RAYS

C. D. Zerby

The total radiation dose in the crew compartment
of an airplane is partially dependent on the gammo-
ray flux penetrating the compartment shield. To
obtain o fundamental, but practical, knowledge of
the gamma-ray penetrations, the problem has been
treated theoretically by using stochastie, or Monte
Carlo methods.

The problem was programed for solution on the
ORACLE ond was arranged for investigating the
effects of the variations of all the parameters in-
volved. The shield was taken as o composite slab
of two materials comprising a thick layer of Compton
scattering material ' followed by a thin layer of
fead. In each of many cases the initial incident
photons were taken as monoenergetic and incident
on the slab at a particular angle with the normal'to
the slab. The stochastic process used the exact
physical analog of the probability laws known to
govern the life of a photon.

 

]In the range of energy considered, the Compiocn
scatterer has opproximately the same physical chorac-
teristics relative to a photon passing through it as does
concrete or polyethylene (CH,).

AIR SCATTERING OF NEUTRONS

In an effort to understand the air-scattered neutron
intensities which have been measured af the Tower

assumptions. The predominant difference between

better fit to the data, such aspects as onisotropy of
scattering and slant penetration at the detector tank
(crew shield) have been taken into account in some
of the work. Furthermore, measurements have been
made of the angular distribution of the radiation
leaving the reactor shield, and these data have
been used in some of the calculations.

Because the importance of the multiply scottered
neutrons has appeared to be greater than was antici-
pated, considerable effort has been mads to extend
the calculations to beyond the singly scattered
case. Some results ore reported for two scatterings,
and o general method has been developed for all
orders of scattering.

Single Anisofropic Air Scattering in the Presence

of the Ground (Shielded Detector)
F. H. Murray

For a cenvenient machine calculation, the at-
tenuation in air was neglected, The detector was
placed with 10 cm of water between it and the face
of the crew shield which, when extended, contained
the reactor source. The beam from the source was
about an oxis through the detector, in theory, and
contained terms cos a and cos® @ a calculation
was made separately for the terms 1, cos o, and
cos? ain ithe expansion of the source flux. I D is
the reactor-detector distance and b the height of
both above the ground, the flux at the detector is
expressed as the sum of the terms:

Single !sotropic Air Scattering in the Presence

of the Ground (Unshielded Detector)
J. E. Favulkner

A colculation was made of the reading of an iso-
tropic detector caused by first-scattered neutrons
in air as the distance above the ground was varied.
The following assumptions were made:

1. The source and detector have the same alti-
tude,

2. The ground is an infinite plone.

3. The source is isoiropic.

4. The scattering in air is isotropic.

5. There is no energy degradation on air scatter-
ing.

6. The attenuation is pure inverse square.

With these assumptions the reading on the detector
may be shown to be proportional to

GROUND SCATTERING OF NEUTRONS
A. Simon H. E. Stern

An investigation is being carried out to derive
formulas for the ground-scattered neutron flux to
be obtained from a general source distribution. The
model used is that of a source whose axis, or
direction of maximum intensity, forms an arbitrary
angle 0 with the source-receiver axis but lies in
the same horizontal plane as the latter. The
differential source strength is assumed to be a
function of only the angle between the emergent
ray and the source axis. The receiver is isotropic
under the assumptions of no air attenuation and a
constant albedo for the ground. The following
expressions for the flux at the receiver are ob-

tained:

FOCUSING OF RADIATION IN A
CYLINDRICAL CREW COMPARTMENT

J. E. Faulkner

A study of the focusing of radiation in o cylindri-
cal crew compartment has been made, with particular
attention being given to the case with the following
conditions: |

1. The cylinder is infinite.

2. The

3. The distribution of the radiation
depends only on the angle between the direction of
emergence and the normal to the cylinder.

4. The attenuation inside the crew space is pure

surface radiation density is constant

angulor

inverse square.

5. The detector is isotropic.

Under these conditions the angular distribution
may be represented as an isotropic component plus
a series in odd powers of the cosine. The contri-
bution of each term at a given point in the com-
ponent in the series may be expressed in an even
polynomial in x (see Fig. 11.3), where x is the
distance of the given point from the axis-of the
cylinder divided by the radius of the cylinder.
For pure cosine distribution the reading of an
isotropic detector is independent of position in the
crew compartment,

REFLECTOR-MODERATED REACTOR

J. B. Dee

D. K. Trubey W. Steyert

A second series of mockup tests for the circu-
fating-fuel reflector-moderated reactor (RMR) and
shield is being initiated at the LTSF.! For this
series o larger tank (approximately a 6-ft cube) has
been constructed to hold all the dry components of
the configurations, as well as an exponsible plastic
bag for containing boroted water. The beryllium
blocks to be used in the mockups will also be
placed inplastic containers for additional protection.

The dry tank face adjacent to the source plate
has a ]/B-in.-’rhick Incone! window, which corre-
sponds to the RMR core shell. In order to determine
the effect of the Inconel on the gamma-ray dose,

gamma measurements were taken in pure water in
the tank. The dose was higher by a foctor of 2
than that normally observed in the LTSF, and the
increase agrees closely with the calculated 9-Mev
capture gomma-ray dose from the Inconel.

I addition to the presently planned static fission
source tests for RMR designs, a dynamic fission
source test is being considered for measuring the
sodium activation from delayed neutrons released
in the heat exchanger and the attenuation of gamma
rays from shori-lived fission products. A liquid

EFFECTIVE REMOVAL
CROSS SECTION OF CARBON

D. K. Trubey

Megsurements of the removal cross section of
carbon have been made in a continuous carbon
medium obtained by dissolving sugar (C,,H,,0,,)
The solution (density = 1.312 + 0.001
g/cm3) contained 64.2 wt % sugar, which gave
0.354 g/ecm® of carbon and o hydrogen and oxygen

density that was 96% of that of plain water. It was
contained in a large tank that had a I/B-in.-thick
Inconel window on the source side.

it replaces. Since the presence of the graphite

rather severely, the neutron flux distributions and

REACTOR AIR GLOW

R. G, Cochran T. A. Love
K. M. Henry F. C. Maienschein
R. W, Peelle

Attempts to theoretically determine the amount of
visible light which may surround a nuclear-powered
airplane in flight have resulted in widely differing

170

values,®s® Therefore an experiment was performed
at the BSF to provide an experimental basis for
future estimates.

The end of an air-filled aluminum periscope tube
was placed at the reactor face, and the amount of
light produced in the tube was measured by a
photomultiplier with spectral response
to that of the average human eye. Other relative
measurements were taken with a photomultiplier
which was sensitive chiefly in the blue and near-
ultraviolet range., The latter measurements are
plotted in Fig. 13.6 as functions of the air pressure
in the tube, Measurements with argon in the tube
demonstrate that neither the approximate amount of
light produced nor the exact spectrum emitted is
strongly dependent on the atomic number of the
gas. It is also interesting to note that the light
production in a given volume of air appears to have
a maximum at a pressure corresponding to an
altitude of about 30,000 fi.

It is demonstrated in Figs. 13.7 and 13.8 that
the air glow is largely caused by gomma radiation
rather than by neutrons. Figure 13.7 shows the
decay of the light plotted along with the decay of
the reactor gamma ion chamber current just after

the radiation which produces the air glow is shown
in Fig. 13.8. This attenuation rather closely
follows that of gamma rays.

similar

The photomultiplier was used to compare the
quantity of light given off in the air-glow tube with
that from a small tungsten lamp mounted at the
reactor end of the tube, This comparison showed
that 7.2 x 107° lumen was given off by the glow
for a reactor power of 100 kw and atfmospheric
pressure, Presumably, the amount of light should
be proportional to the integral of the gamma-ray
dose rate over the volume of the air inthe measuring
tube. This integral wos estimated to be 1.1 x 1010
(r-em)/hr. Therefore the effective light production
per unit volume of air is

L = 6.5 %1071 (lumen/cm3)/(r/hr) .

aircraft, For a reactor power of 200 Mw and a
reactor shield of 147 em of water (similar to the
shield design of the 1950 ANP Shielding Soard?),
the BSF measurements indicate that the gamma-ray
dose just outside the edge of the shield would be
1.36 » 10% r/hr with a relaxation length of 22 cm.
The dose integrated over space outside the shield
is 1.2 x 10'5 (recm®)/hr. Multiplying this by L,
the luminosity would be 75 lumens, which would
have roughly the equivalent brightness to the eye
of a 10-w (+7 w) incandescent light if the aircraft
were far enough away to appear as a point source

FUEL ACTIVATION METHOD FOR POWER
DETERMINATION OF THE ARE

E. B. Johnson

When the ARE goes into operation, many measure-
ments of its performance will be made. Among
them will be the power level at which it operates,
which will be measured in more than one way. A
method suggested by J. L. Meem is based on the
measurement of the relative activity of fuel samples
exposed in the ARE and in a known flux in another
reactor (BSR}). An experiment has been initiated
at the BSF to implement this suggestion.

Causing Air Glow,

The activity resulting from the irradiation of
fissionable material is not easy to predict because
of the large number of isotopes for which calcu-
lations would be required. However, for identical
flux, exposure time, and waiting period after
exposure, the specific activity of two samples
should be the same. Furthermore, at low neutron
fluxes the activity should be proportional to the
flux.

[t is contemplated that the ARE will be operated
at a nominal power level of gpproximately 1 w for
1 hr, that it wiil then be shut down, and that a
sample of the irradiated fuel will be withdrawn for
counting and analyzing, The ARE experimental
program will then proceed as scheduled. A decay
curve will be run on this fuel sample from the ARE
and compared with the decay curve obtained on o
similor fuel capsule irradiated for the same length
of time in the BSR in a known neutron flux of about
the same magnitude. From the relative activity of
the two samples, the operating power of the ARE

The Tower Shielding Facility (TSF) experimental
program has, thus far, included measurements of
ground- and air-scattered fast neutrons and the
development of a new procedure for the determi-
nation of the power of the reactor. Tests on the
GE-ANP R-1 divided-shield mockup haove been

started.

FAST-NEUTRON GROUND AND AIR
SCATTERING MEASUREMENTS

T. V. Blosser J. Von Hoomissen

D. L. Giililand F. N. Watson

The performance of neutron and gamma-ray air
scottering experiments that are free from an ex-
cessive background of ground-scattered radiation
is a primary objective of the TSF, Therefore,
measurements of the scattered fast neutrons aos
a function of reactor-detector altitude were neces-
sary to determine the contribution of ground-
scattered radiation to the total flux, particularly
at the maximum altitude. These measurements will
help to indicate the magnitude of the ground-
scattered neutron background to be expected in
future differential experiments, and they will aid
in an understanding of the variation of ground and
air scattering as the ground is approached.

Measurements of the thermal-neutron distribution
were token in the detector tank, which is es-
sentially a 5-ft cube of water and which was, for
these experiments, situated 64 ft from the reactor
tank. The reactor was placed at an angle ¢ of
330 dey from the 4 axis (Fig. 14.1), and a BF,
counter was moved along a line normal to and near
the right side of the detector tank. In this region,
contributions from other faces of the tank were
negligible; thus the neutrons detected by fthe
counter were the air- or ground-scattered fast
neutrons which entered the side wall and were
thermalized in the water near the detector. The
reactor and detector tank altitudes were varied
simultaneously, in discrete steps, from 0 to 195 ft.

T R WA A ——— i

A composite plot of the measurements {(Fig. 14.2)
indicated only small differences in slope but ap-
precicble differences in magnitude between the
curves for the various altitudes. A plot of the
flux vs the daltitude (Fig. 14.3) showed o .pro-
nounced peck in the region. between the 15- and
20-ft altitudes, which indicated the importance of
ground-scattered neutrons in this region. [t should
be noted that the reading ot zero altitude was
obtained with the reactor half-immersed in the
ground pool, the upper half being shielded as
before; so essentially half of the source was
occluded, as was half of the scattering medium.
Thus the air-scattered neutrons should be no more
than half of the value at full altitude and no less
than one quarter. Becnuse the intensities at the
150- and 195-ft altitudes were the same, it was
concluded that the ground-scattered contribution
at these altitudes was small,

fn a preliminary analysis of the dota, it was
estimated that this contribution was 2 to 5% of
the total scattered neutrons. While the detailed
caleulations of ground and air scattering being
undertaken in connection with this investigation
are not yet completed, o preliminary comparison
of the dato with calculations carried out ot the
Boeing Airplane Company for a not too dissimilar
situation has been made. The qualitotive agree-
ment is very good, although the pedk in the total
flux, as measured, seems to be at o lower altitude.
A report on this experiment is being prepared.!

Thermocouple measurements of the bulk
temperature in the 12-ff-dia reactor tank

rate of temperature rise of the water when the
reactor is started is then proportional to the power
of the reactor. Small corrections must be made
for the power input due to the mixing and for the
heat loss.

This procedure was first used for a 5 by 6 fuel
element loading in the TSR. The reactor tank
was lowered into the drained handling pool, and
four mixers were placed at various positions within
the tank. The turbulence created by the mixers
was sufficient for thorough mixing of the water,
but the power added by the mixers was not enough
to give a measurable increase of the water temper-

ature. Before the reactor was started, the temper-

178

ature remained constant for more than 1 hr with
the mixers running.

Soine heat insulation was obtained by creating,
with a double layer of canvas, a dead-air space
above the water and around the reactor tank. The
temperature rise during a reactor run was measured
by 12 thermocouples placed in the tank. The
thermocouples had previously been calibrated at
temperatures of 0, 25, and 50°C and agreed to
within 0.1°C.

The first run of the experiment was started at
24°C, and the total temperature rise was approxi-
mately 14°C.
higher temperature level but with the some heat
input initial
temperature for this run was dpproximately 15°C
above the ambient temperature, and the rise was
again 14°C. The cooling rate ot the conclusion
of this run was 0.3°C/hr. In a third run the initial
temperature was brought 15°C below the ambient
by cooling the reactor tank with ice before the run.
The results of the three runs were consistent to
within 1%. A detailed report of this experiment
is being prepared.?

The experiment was repeated at a
