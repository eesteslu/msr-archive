This report provides an assessment of candidate salts proposed as the coolant for the loop that
shuttles heat from the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) to the Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative
(NHI) hydrogen-production plant. The physical properties most relevant for coolant service were
reviewed, and key chemical factors that influence material compatibility were also analyzed for the
purpose of screening candidate salts. A preliminary assessment of the cost of the raw materials
required to produce the coolant is also presented.

Salts that are suitable for use as the primary coolant in a high-temperature nuclear reactor were
previously analyzed. Some of the fluoride salts identified in the previous study are also appropriate for
consideration as the secondary coolant in a heat-transfer loop; therefore, results from the previous
report are used in this document. However, alternative coolant salts (i.e., chlorides and fluoroborates)
that were not considered in the previous report should be considered for service in the heat-transfer
loop. These alternative coolants are considered in this report.

Table ES.1 presents a summary of the properties of the candidate coolants for the heat-transfer loop.
Certain factors in this table, such as melting point and vapor pressure, can be viewed as stand-alone
parameters for screening candidates. Heat-transfer properties are considered as a group in Sect. 3 in order
to evaluate the combined effects of various properties. Deficiencies in the properties database were found
in the same areas as were identified in the previous report: (a) thermal conductivity is the property with the
greatest uncertainty and is the most difficult to measure, and (b) the heat capacity database can be
improved with modern instruments and a modest effort.

The same trends in ranking coolant performance found in the previous report were also found in
this report: lighter “low-Z" salts (salts containing elements with low atomic number) tend to exhibit
better heat-transfer performance metrics. Ranking of salts based upon corrosion characteristics was
again found to be inconclusive; however, some key factors were identified for further study. In
particular, it appears that better preparative chemistry methods are needed to produce the high-purity
chloride salts for corrosion studies. As in the case of fluoride salts, the identification and testing of
redox buffers to suppress corrosion of the container alloy is highly desirable and may be absolutely

necessary for operation of the heat-transfer loop at the highest temperatures with other halide salts.

1. INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this report is to provide a review of relevant properties of candidate salts for use in the
evaluation and ranking of coolants for the heat-transfer loop that shuttles heat from the Next Generation
Nuclear Plant (NGNP) to the Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative (NHI) hydrogen-production plant. Considerable
experience exists with molten salts; however, previous nuclear experience with molten salts was for
reactor systems that contained fissile and fertile material in the primary fluid (which served as both fuel
and primary coolant). The NGNP/NHI heat-transfer loop will use “clean” coolant salt and will operate at
much higher temperatures than previous applications. The assumption for previous nuclear applications
with molten salt was that the container alloy would need to last for 30 years. For the present heat-
transfer-loop application, the system requirements and salt properties may be quite different than for
previous applications. Therefore, a new assessment of coolant options is required.

High-temperature operation (>700°C) and new compositions have been evaluated based on the open
literature and internal reports available to the author and on use of the best available estimation
techniques. Recommended estimation methods are identified when possible, and a brief discussion of
measurement techniques is included when necessary. A number of fluoride salt compositions have been
examined in detail in previous studies (e.g., eutectic compositions of LiF-BeF,, NaF-BeF,, LiF-NaF-KF,
and NaF-ZrF,). For applications that use molten salt outside of a neutron field, additional salts may be
considered. Candidate coolants can include salts deemed unsuitable as a primary coolant but judged as
acceptable for use in a heat-transfer loop. Familiar oxygen-containing salts (nitrates, sulfates, and
carbonates) are excluded from consideration because they do not possess the necessary thermochemical
stability at high temperatures. These salts are also incompatible with the use of carbon materials because
they decompose at high temperatures to release oxygen, which rapidly reacts with the available carbon.

The screening logic for selecting secondary salt coolants requires that the elements constituting the

coolant must form compounds that:

1. have chemical stability at T > 800°C,
2. melt at useful temperatures (<525°C) and are not volatile, and

3. are compatible with high-temperature alloys, graphite, and ceramics.

In addition to the fluoride salts considered in an earlier report, two families of salts fulfill these three
basic requirements: (a) chloride salts and (b) alkali fluoroborates (MBF,, M = alkali element). The
properties of these two families of salts are reviewed and evaluated in this report. Other coolants (water,

liquid metals, and fluoride salts) are included for the purpose of heat-transfer comparisons in Sect. 3.
2. REVIEW OF PROPERTIES

2.1 MELTING POINT AND VAPOR PRESSURE

Without question, the melting (or freezing) point is the single most important physical property for a
candidate coolant. The requirement for a low freezing temperature is dependent, to some degree, on the
system design. Because salt coolants possess high heat capacity, the temperature drop in a salt heat-
transfer loop is typically smaller than for other high-temperature coolants. The previous generation of
secondary coolant salts for use in a Molten Salt Reactor was expected to operate in a steam generator; thus,
a secondary-salt freezing point less than 400°C was required [1].

The situation for the NHI heat-transfer loop is different from that of primary or secondary salts
identified for the Molten Salt Reactor. We do not know the exact demands that the heat-transfer loop will
place on a molten salt coolant, nor do we know the demands that will be defined in the heat exchangers at
each end of the loop. Thus, we cannot set the freezing point requirements for secondary coolant with
confidence. However, a recent report [2] has used properties of typical salt coolants, some basic
assumptions, and hypothetical heat exchanger designs in order to predict thermal profiles in both the heat-
transfer loop and the heat exchangers at each process interface: (a) the intermediate heat exchanger at the
reactor and (b) the process heat exchanger at the hydrogen plant. The previous report [2] considered the
helium-cooled reactor that exchanged heat with a molten salt to be the heat-transfer agent in the loop. The
peak helium temperature is assumed to be 900°C, the salt 1s assumed to be supplied to the hydrogen plant
at ~870°C, and the working fluid in the hydrogen plant is assumed to be raised from an inlet temperature
of 340°C to 850°C. Various loop/heat-exchanger configurations and cases were analyzed in this report.
For the reference conditions analyzed, considerable thermal margin to freezing exists. The minimum
steady-state temperature in the loop under reference conditions is ~680°C, which represents a margin for
freezing of 200°C for NaF-NaBF, salt and 130°C for FLiNaK salt. Grace periods for the onset of freezing
were estimated to occur between 65-80 min for an off-site power loss and between 5—7 min for a loss-of-
heat-sink transient. These times were deemed reasonable for taking actions to prevent the problems that
would occur with substantial freezing of the salt. Therefore, the previous report [2] appears to indicate
that the properties and freezing points associated with FLiNaK (454°C m.p.) and NaF-NaBF, (385°C)
may be acceptable for use in the heat-transfer loop. Other options for heat-transfer agents are identified in
this report.

An extensive database of phase diagrams exists for salt systems of all types [3]; therefore, there is
very little need to pursue estimation techniques. Because no single-component salt freezes at a

sufficiently low temperature, multicomponent mixtures of salts are required. Nearly all of the binary
phase diagrams of interest have been measured, and many of the ternary systems have also been
investigated. In general, the primary lowering of freezing point (as much as 500°C) occurs with the
addition of the first salt to a pure component. Additional lowering of the freezing point can be achieved
by adding a third component, but these freezing point depressions are of a lower order (~50°C).
Additional components are typically important for reasons other than lowering the freezing point (e.g.,
cost or some other physical or chemical property).

Salts that are useful as secondary coolants have been identified in previous reports [4-6]: (a) alkali-
fluorides, (b) ZrF4-salt mixtures, (¢) fluoroborate salts, and (d) chloride salts. Beryllium fluoride-
containing salts have been excluded from this list because of the potential toxicity of beryllium
compounds and their high cost. Table 1 lists the primary eutectic compositions in each salt family in
order of freezing point. Phase diagrams [5, 6] of the most important binary fluoroborate and chloride
systems are included in Figs. 1-8. Discussion and analysis of phase diagrams and properties of the alkali

fluorides and ZrF,-salt mixtures were included in a previous report [7].

Many salts with reasonably low melting points have been excluded from the list in Table 1. The two
primary reasons for exclusion are as follows: either the salts exhibit too high a vapor pressure (for
example, AlCls, ZrCly, and BeCl, salts} or they are too corrosive for use at high temperatures [metal
halides of Fe, Sn, Bi, Cd, Zn, and T, as well as oxygen-containing salts (nitrates, sulfates, and
carbonates}]. Two classes of salts that meet the criteria in the previous list and are not necessarily too
volatile ot too corrosive have also been excluded from Table 1: (a} heavy halide salts containing bromine
and 1odine, and (b} muxed-halide salts with dissimilar halide anions (mixtures of chlorides, fluorides,
bromides, and iodides}. The poor heat-transfer metrics of heavy salts and the extra expense of bromine
and iodine constituents argue against the use of these salts. The mixed-halide candidates do not offer
compelling advantages over those salts identified in Table 1, and are considerably more complicated
systems te prepare and understand. The discussion in Sect. 3 indicates that consideration of heavy halide
salts (e.g., bromine} is likely to be prohibitive because chloride salts represent the lower limit of desirable
heat-transfer performance for salts.

It is useful to review the basic phase behavior of the pure components and mixtures that comprise
Table 1. Table 2 contains a summary of freezing point, boiling peint, and 900°C vapor pressure for all

pure-component constituents and most of the salt mixtures identified in Table 1.

“Estimated by extrapolation of lower-temperature data (~1100°C) or assumption of ideal mixture behavior.
In nearly ideal mixtures of the alkali halides, each component exerts its own pressure, shown in
Fig. 9, in proportion to its molar composition. For mixtures of alkali halides with polyvalent elements or
with BF;, a dramatic depression of the native vapor pressure of the pure components (i.e., ZrF,) is noted,
due to formation of coordination complexes, as described in an earlier report and illustrated in Fig. 10.
This depression of native vapor pressure also occurs for the same reasons in the fluoroborate system and
the chloride salts and displays the same trends as described in the previous report (more effective halide-
ion donation/complex formation for the heavier alkali halides). Thus, the mixture of BF; with heavier
alkali fluorides results in a lower-vapor-pressure salt. The data are not as extensive for the chloride salts;
however, a significant drop in vapor pressure was measured in the KCI-MgCl, system as compared with
pure MgCl, and pure KCI [8]. Figure 10 demonstrates that, in general, optimized compositions of
fluorides have the lowest vapor pressure, followed by chlorides, and then fluoroborates.

A previous report on the heat-transfer-loop application [2] considered two salt options for the heat-
transfer loop: LiF-NaF-KF eutectic (i.e., “FLiNaK”) and (b) the sodium fluoroborate (NaF-NaBF,)
eutectic. Table 2 and Fig.10 indicate that the estimated vapor pressure [actually a decomposition pressure
of NaBF, —> NaF + BF;(g)] of sodium fluoroborate at 900°C is extremely high (~13 atm) and will likely
exclude this salt from consideration. Potassium fluoroborate has a much lower vapor pressure at 900°C
(~0.13 atm) and is a better choice for the heat-transfer-loop application. The pressure of potassium
fluoroborate at 900°C is approximately equal to the vapor pressure of sodium fluoroborate at 620°C [the
temperature proposed for use of NaF-NaBF, in the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR)]. The vapor
pressure of the rubidium fluoroborate eutectic has not been measured, but it will certainly be somewhat
less than the value for the potassium fluoroborate eutectic.

In a previous report [7], the importance of the identity and behavior of the vapor species was
highlighted for the ZrF,-containing salts. The recommendation was to consider ZrF, salts that exhibited
very low vapor pressures (i.e., salts with 2045 mol % ZrF,, depending on the alkali fluoride present and
the temperature) to avoid the problems associated with the sublimation and transport of ZrF,. A similar
situation may apply to MgCl,-containing salts, and it is likely that a chloride salt composition that
minimizes the vapor pressure of MgCl, (~20-45% MgCl,) will be preferred. This composition range
coincides with the location of the low-temperature eutectics containing MgCl, and alkali halides. Salt
mixtures containing BF; in the form of a fluoroborate anion (BF, ) present some special features that

merit additional discussion.

Consideration of fluoroborate salts as the secondary coolant for the MSBR was driven by the need for
a low-cost coolant that exhibited superior heat-transfer properties. Fluoroborates met these requirements,
but they also imposed some additional constraints, often referred to as “nuisance” factors, that should be
recognized. Most of these nuisance factors do not affect the fundamental viability of the fluoroborate
coolant option and are due to the significant pressure (>0.5 atm) of BF; that exists over a fluoroborate salt
at useful temperatures.

Work at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) identified some of the practical issues that must be
addressed when using fluoroborates [9, 10]. In order to maintain the eutectic salt composition, it is
necessary to monitor and control the BF; pressure of the cover gas. There are inevitably purge gas
streams, for example, those associated with shaft seals and bearings on pumps or other machinery.
Therefore, the exhaust from these systems must include a means to trap BF; or to recycle it.

Some additional factors should be recognized that do not require special process systems but that
change the character of operations when compared with more conventional low-vapor-pressure halide
salts. In fluoroborate systems the cover gas contains a significant quantity of toxic BF; gas that will
hydrolyze to form HF and hydroxyfluoroborate upon contact with moist air (or in the lung). Any leakage
of moisture into the coolant system will rapidly generate highly corrosive HF and hydroxyfluoroborate.
Even simple operations, such as bubbling an inert gas (e.g., helium) in molten fluoroborates, can cause
plugging problems because of the local depletion of BF; from the salt (and the resulting increase in
melting point). Potential solutions were found for all of these problems at ORNL, but it is not clear that
one would choose fluoroborates if a simpler salt system could meet the requirements for the coolant. The

nuisance factors associated with the use of fluoroborates can be summarized as follows:

1. Purge-gas streams in contact with the salt must provide for trapping and/or recycle of the considerable
pressure of BFs;.

2. Exclusion of traces of moisture to the cover-gas supply and purge-gas exhaust system is of paramount
importance because of the rapid generation of HF from mixing of moisture and BF;. Purged sealing
surfaces and bearings are especially vulnerable to moisture-induced corrosion.

3. Because of the rapid hydrolysis when BF; encounters moisture, safety systems associated with
leakage of fluoroborate salts from process piping will be more complex to design, analyze, and
construct.

4. Gas-salt contacting operations must be carefully designed to avoid local depletion of the BF; content
of the salt. This will require control systems to monitor and adjust the BF; content of the gas supply.

None of these nuisance factors were encountered when a simple halide salt with manageable vapor
pressure characteristics, such as 2LiF-BeF,, was used for coolant service. At the end of the MSBR
program, studies of alternate coolants were under way to determine if a salt other than a fluoroborate

could meet all the requirements [4].

12
Many of the candidates listed in Table 1 were nominated for study in previous work at ORNL, but the
salts containing rubidium and magnesium were not included. Although rubidium options may have been
considered to be expensive or unusual, the exclusion of the magnesium chloride salts appears to have
been an oversight. The MgCl,-containing salts were considered in previous fast-reactor studies as a fuel
salt, and there appears to be no reason to exclude them from consideration as a coolant for the
NGNP/NHI loop.

2.2 DENSITY

The densities of many of the salt mixtures in Table 1 have been measured. The method of additive
molar volumes for estimating the density of salt mixtures has also been found to be fairly accurate for
many salt mixtures over a wide temperature range. This estimation method and a tabulation of reference
molar volumes for fluoride and fluoroborate mixtures were presented in the previous report [7]. It 1is
expected that the method of additive molar volumes will also prove useful in chloride-salt systems in the
event that reliable experimental information is not available. The density equations for most of chloride
salts in Table 1 have been determined experimentally and are summarized along with those of fluorides

and fluoroborates in Table 3.

2.3 HEAT CAPACITY

The heat capacities of all salt constituents (i.e., compounds) have been measured, and many of the
heat capacities for salt mixtures have also been measured. For cases in which experimental
determinations are not available, the molar heat capacity is estimated based upon pure-component heat
capacities weighted according to mole fraction and any mixing-enthalpy information that is available.
Table 4 contains predictions based on the empirical equation of Dulong-Petit [ 7] for comparison with
experimentally determined, or derived, values of heat capacity. When possible, heat capacity values were
evaluated at 700°C. In some instances no accurate temperature dependence was available from the

experimental database. In general, the variation of heat capacity of molten salts with temperature is

 

 

 

 

small.

2.4 VISCOSITY

Chloride salts and fluoroborates are, in general, very low viscosity melts. They do not exhibit large
changes in viscosity with salt composition (as BeF, mixtures do) and are less viscous than most fluoride
salt mixtures. It is difficult to measure small values of viscosity at high temperatures, and special
methods have been developed for this purpose. However, it should be noted that the difference between
low-viscosity systems rarely controls the choice of the particular salt system; rather, certain compositional
regions of highly viscous systems (such as BeF, salts) are identified as forbidden regions [7]. The
viscosities of the salt mixtures in Table 1, or mixtures very similar in composition, have been measured.

These results, summarized in Fig. 11, reflect the general trends cited above.

Fig. 11. Salt viscosity based upon experimental measurements [11-13, 16, 24-26].

For some of the salt mixtures in Table 1, there are no experimental measurements of viscosity. For
these mixtures, estimates based upon values for pure components and an ideal-mixture viscosity

estimation were made using the following equation [23]:

ideal-mix =1 Z(Xi ¢ M11/3)}3 ) (1)

where: ; is the dynamic viscosity (cP) of component 1, and

X; 1s the mole fraction of component 1.

The ideal-mixture viscosity of the eutectic of LiCI-RbCl is predicted by Eq. (1) to be very close to the
viscosity of the LiCI-KCl eutectic. For the purposes of heat-transfer estimates, the viscosity of the LiCl-
KCl eutectic can be used in estimates of viscosity for the LiCl-RbCl eutectic. Most of the other ternary
mixtures in Table 2 are very slight modifications of binary systems displayed in Fig. 11, and the value of

the binary system can be used for the purposes of heat-transfer calculations.

2.5 THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY

A discussion in a previous report indicated the difficulties and inaccuracies that have plagued the
measurement and our understanding of thermal conductivity of high-temperature molten salts. These
metrological difficulties also apply to high-temperature chloride and fluoroborate salts, and corrections
similar to those made in fluoride systems have also been necessary for the chloride and fluoroborate
systems. Improvements in the measurement of thermal conductivity of high-temperature salts have
consistently led to a lower estimate of the actual value. The recent (and more accurate) measurements
also indicate a very weak dependence of thermal conductivity on temperature. The general trend that
lighter salts (with lower-atomic-number atoms) have higher thermal conductivities has been confirmed by
many investigators [27, 28]. It also appears that families of salt compounds fall onto a single correlating
curve, based upon the average ionic weight (formula weight divided by number of ionic species), as

indicated in Fig. 12.

It has been suggested by a number of investigators that mixtures of salt compounds (such as binary or
ternary eutectics) should display some type of nonideal behavior and that the conductivity is not
characterized by a simple mole-fraction-weighted average of pure-component values. One investigator
[27] has interpreted the addition of a second salt compound as a disruption of the order of the pure-
compound quasi-crystalline lattice, thus representing an increase in disorder, which will then decrease the
amount of heat transferred by the natural vibrational modes. However, the most reliable measurements
indicate that the conductivity of a mixture of salt compounds is very close to the mole-fraction average of
the pure-compound values [29]. For coolant salt mixtures with no reliable measurements, a mole fraction

average has been used to estimate the conductivity in Table 5.

3. HEAT-TRANSFER COMPARISONS

It 1s useful to compare the heat-transfer performance of the NGNP/NHI loop candidate coolants with
those of other coolants that we have experience with or would like to consider for related applications.
With the exception of water, the temperature of 700°C was selected for comparison because this permits
properties to be evaluated more readily. A temperature of 300°C was selected for water, because this is a

typical coolant temperature used in the primary circuit of existing nuclear power plants.

17
Table 6 lists the properties of the additional coolants identified in this report to be used in the heat-
transfer comparisons. Properties of fluoride salts and other comparison coolants were examined in detail

in a previous report [ 7] and are summarized in the Executive Summary of this report.

“Formula weight.

Generalized heat-transfer metrics are a useful tool to group coolant performance in the absence of
more detailed system designs. Bonilla [33] has provided general figures of merit (FOMs) based on

minimal pumping power for a given coolant temperature rise as the objective function for forced

convection:
FOM (forced convection, turbulent) = u**/ (p* sz'8 , 2)
where
L = viscosity,
p = fluid density,
C, = heat capacity.

For natural convection cooling, Bonilla also provide the following groups for passive cooling:

FOM (natural convection, turbulent) = [ MO'Z/ B p’ Cpl'8 036 3)
and

FOM (natural convection, laminar) = [ u/ § p2 Col 05 4)

where
B = volume expansivity = 1/p  dp/dT [1/°C] .

During evaluation of secondary coolants for the MSBR, Sanders [1] proposed an FOM related to the

area required for the primary heat exchanger:

FOM (heat exchanger area) = uo'z/ [pO‘?’CpO‘6 < 5)

18
Sanders recommends that this FOM be used only for comparisons within a coolant group type (salts,
metals, or other). All of these FOMs are “golf scores”—that is, lower numbers correlate with better
performance. Tables 7 summarizes the various FOMs for the comparison and candidate coolants.

In general, we can conclude that the lighter molten salts [those not containing large quantities of
higher-atomic-number elements (e.g., rubidium and zirconium)] have somewhat better heat-transfer
performance than the heavy salts. The one exception is the laminar regime of natural convection. In many

passive cooling situations, the turbulent natural convection component is of primary importance.

It 1s expected that the turbulent-forced-convection metrics are the most important for the purposes of

the NGNP/NHI loop application.

4. COST OF SALTS

Many important economic factors must be considered with respect to selection of coolant. However,
at this stage of the NGNP/NHI loop design, it 1s most useful to focus on the acquisition cost of the salt
coolant. The cost of the salt associated with a significant deployment of the heat-transfer loops is the

most important value. Unfortunately, at present, we cannot predict this cost for all salts, because some of

19
the constituents of candidate salts are not commodity chemicals and the cost associated with the
deployment of significant numbers of heat-transfer loops would “swamp” the existing markets and would
change the price that is offered.

However, there are some basic trends and facts that can be used to help understand how to classify
and evaluate the costs of various salt constituents. In 1971, ORNL conducted a survey of potential
coolants that could be used as the secondary coolant in the MSBR design [1]. In the context of this
survey, solicitations were made to vendors to provide prices for candidate salts. The desire was to
establish an estimate of the unit prices required for supplying the coolant inventory (~280,000 L) for a
1000-MW (e) MSBR plant. Some vendors could not supply estimates for an order this large, and
extrapolation methods were employed to refine the estimates whenever possible. The results of these
1971 price estimates are shown in Table 8. A more recent survey of trade-journal pricing for relevant salt
constituents is included as Table 9.

Based on the 1971 study and the more recent trade-journal values, it is evident that the constituents of
candidate coolants fall into two categories: (a) relatively inexpensive commodity chemicals (NaF, NaCl,
KCl, and MgCl,) and (b) moderately expensive specialty materials produced on a large scale (zirconium
metal, LiF, and LiCl). The zirconium prices in Table 8 and 9 do not reflect the cost associated with

hafnium removal.

Table 10 shows the costs of the raw materials associated with the various candidate salt mixtures.
Based on these raw material costs, it is clear that many of the chloride salts are the least expensive,
followed by fluoroborate salts, and then fluoride salts. It is possible that this classification could change
for some constituents based upon market factors not yet considered. For example, there exist two
alternative raw material sources for obtaining ZrF,: (a) recovery of irradiated cladding and fuel element
hardware and (b) recovery of ZrF, from spent pickling solution streams (from HF cleaning of Zircalloy).
It 1s also possible that the market could change the specialty prices associated with RbF and KF
compounds. Alkali ores possess considerable amounts of rubidium and potassium minerals that currently
remain unused and accumulate in tailing piles. Rubidium has an unusual position with respect to markets.
While the world market for rubidium is extremely small (4 tons/year), it ranks as the 23rd most abundant
element on earth (the 16th most abundant metal). Rubidium is more abundant than copper, lead, and

zinc—and much more abundant than lithium or cesium.

5. CHEMICAL CONSIDERATIONS

A previous report [7] presented a review and discussion of chemical factors related to the selection of
fluoride salts for primary coolant applications. The most important chemical factor concerns the
maintenance of acceptably small levels of corrosion for the materials to be used in piping, tanks, and
components. Alloy corrosion is the key materials-compatibility issue that is influenced by salt chemistry.
The same basic principles discussed in the previous report govern the chemical behavior of chloride salts
and, to some extent, fluoroborate salts. The corrosion database applicable to coolant applications for
chloride and fluoroborate salts is not as extensive as that established for fluoride salts. The chloride and
fluoroborate database is also populated by salts with relatively large and often unquantified levels of
corrosive impurities; thus, it is more difficult to draw conclusions from this body of work. Because of
this fact, this section highlights the preparative chemistry of chloride and fluoroborate salts. A review of
the thermodynamics of the chloride and fluoroborate salt systems relevant to corrosion chemistry is first
provided, followed by a consideration of preparative chemistry, and finally a discussion of the relevant

corrosion database.

22
5.1 THERMODYNAMIC FACTORS

Many useful analogies can be drawn between chloride and fluoride salts. Both halide salts are
excellent fluxes and generally preclude the use of passive layers to provide corrosion protection. The
electrochemical sequence in both systems ranks elements in a similar order. However, there are also
some important differences with respect to thermodynamic stability and coordination behavior. For
example, the most stable form of uranium in fluorides is UF,, whereas the most stable form of uranium in
chlorides is UCI;. These differences in the coordination chemistry and the thermodynamic stability affect
the speciation of transition-metal solutes, and are relevant to the corrosion chemistry in chloride and
fluoroborate systems.

The thermodynamics of corrosion in fluoride salts was examined in considerable detail at ORNL.
This work included treatment of salt-solution nonideality and was not based solely on the
thermodynamics of simple compounds in an ideal thermodynamic mixture. Extensive consideration of
corrosion by oxygen-containing impurity constituents was not necessary for the fluoride system because
of the highly effective purification methods that were developed. Previous work on corrosion in chloride
systems has been most often discussed in terms of the thermodynamics of pure solid compounds and has
been dominated by effects of oxygen-containing impurities. Different thermodynamic conventions have
also evolved for analysis of each salt system. The most straightforward comparison can be made based
upon the free-energy of formation of the salt constituents and the corresponding metal-halide products
that result from corrosion of a container alloy. Table 11 indicates that there appears to be somewhat less
inherent thermodynamic stability in the chloride system than in the fluoride system (i.e., the difference in
free energy between salt fluorides and alloy fluorides is larger for the fluoride system than it is for

chloride system).

Many additional factors will influence the corrosion of alloys in contact with salts, but it is useful to
keep 1n mind that the fundamental thermodynamic driving force for corrosion appears to be slightly
greater in chloride systems than it is in fluorides. This treatment ignores a number of important salt-
solution effects, especially for salt mixtures that exhibit large deviations from ideal thermodynamic
behavior. Additional study in the laboratory will be needed in order to understand whether chloride salts
are fundamentally more corrosive toward alloys than fluorides are and whether corrosion control
strategies can be devised that can be used with, or favor, chloride salt systems.

The fluoroborates under consideration are not conventional salt systems that share a common anion
(i.e., chlorides, fluorides). Rather, they are reciprocal salt mixtures that contain identical alkali cations
(Na", K", or Rb") but a mixture of dissimilar anions (F~ or BF, ). The predominant anion in the
fluoroborate eutectic mixture 1s the BF, anion. The BF, anion has an ionic radius similar to that of I
and an electronic polarizability slightly higher than that of C1 . Phase diagrams of analogous systems
with BF, replaced by I' often have a similar character. It has also been noted that the BF, anion is
similar in size and shape to the perchlorate ion (ClO, ) and shares the property of not forming
coordination compounds with transition metals. The solubility of alloy-metal halides (e.g., CrF; or
Na3zCrFg) in fluoroborates is much smaller than in simple halide salt systems and displays a dramatic
decrease with decreasing temperatures. This limited solubility (0.46, 0.046, and 0.01 mol % Na;CrF; at
700, 500, and 385°C, respectively) presented a potential problem in steam-cycle heat exchangers, because
of the likelihood of deposition of corrosion products in the cold spot of the heat exchanger (and plugging
the flow channel).

The interaction of trace amounts of oxides, air, or moisture (either in the salt or cover gas) with
fluoroborates often controls alloy corrosion, but these chemical interactions are complex and are not
completely understood. The hydrolysis of BF; in the presence of any moisture in the cover gas above the
salt is rapid and generates HF that is intensely corrosive to the system, especially when it is absorbed into
molten salt. Some of the actual oxygen- and hydrogen-containing species that result from hydrolysis of
BF; in the salt have been identified. However, our understanding of this chemistry is not complete [36],
and more work is needed before preparative chemistry and online purification requirements can be
defined with confidence.

The behavior of hydrogen- and oxygen-containing species in fluoroborates is also important because
it provides a means to sequester tritium in the salt, and thus an intermediate fluoroborate loop could serve
as an effective tritium barrier. The species that is likely responsible for holding tritium in the salt was
identified by Maya [37], and an engineering-scale experimental program was conducted that proved the

effectiveness of sodium fluoroborate in sequestering tritium [38].

24
Thermodynamic free energies that drive corrosion in the fluoroborate system were developed for the

actual NaF-NaBF, solvent system and are shown in Table 12.

Because of the potential for coherent metal borides to form on the surface of the container alloy,
additional factors must be considered in the fluoroborate system. The oxidation of metal alloy constituent
(usually chromium) during a redox-driven corrosion process must be accompanied by reduction of a salt
constituent. It is possible to reduce B*" in the fluoroborate salt to form a metal boride (e.g., Cr,B or TiB,)
or elemental boron. Boron deposits have been identified on the alloy surface during numerous corrosion
tests. The analytical tests performed at the time did not uncover the chemical identity of the deposited
boron. It has been suggested that if the deposited boron exists as a boride, it could possibly confer some
corrosion resistance as a resistant surface layer. Borides are one of the few classes of ceramics that exhibit
stability in the presence of fluoride salts and do not fall victim to a fluoride flux by dissolving into the
salt. However, all tests with fluoroborate salts containing large amounts of impurity oxides and moisture
have demonstrated intense corrosion and no evidence of passivation of the alloy surface in contact with

fluoroborates.

5.2 PREPARATIVE CHEMISTRY

The first step in molten salt work is acquisition of raw components, which are then combined to
produce a melt mixture that has the desired properties when melted. However, most suppliers of halide
salts do not provide materials that can be used directly. To prevent severe corrosion of the container
metal, major impurities must be removed in addition to moisture/oxide contaminants. Hydrofluorination
has proven to be a very effective method for the removal of oxygen-containing impurities from fluoride

salts [7]. Removal of oxygen-containing impurities from chloride and fluoroborate salts is considerably

25
more difficult, because fluoride ion more readily displaces oxygen from most compounds than does
chloride 1on and because borate and hydroxyborate impurities are difficult to fluorinate with HF.

Nearly all of the chloride salts prepared for corrosion studies have contained relatively high levels of
oxygen-containing impurities. The typical salt preparation for these studies involved treatment of reagent
chlorides by drying the solid salt under vacuum, followed by prolonged treatment with dry HCI gas, and
finishing with an inert gas purge of HCI from the salt. This treatment is not effective in removing the last
portion of bound oxygen from the salt. Depending on the salt composition, oxygen contents of up to a
few percent may remain. A more effective method for removing oxygen is needed if the basic corrosion
mechanism in pure chloride salts 1s to be investigated; otherwise, the effects of oxygen-containing species
will dominate the apparent corrosion response. The use of carbochlorination has been recommended by
Cherginets [42] for removal of oxygen, and it has been claimed that salts with very low levels of oxygen
content (~3ppm) can be produced by this method [43].

A similar type of purification improvement is needed for fluoroborates. Previous treatments with HF
and BF; (to avoid loss of BF; from the melt) were not as effective as desired. A carbofluorination
treatment for fluoroborate purification was recommended at the end of the Molten Salt Reactor Program
[44], but it does not yet appear to have been developed for fluoride or fluoroborate salts. There is also a
need for accurate analytical methods for determination of oxygen in melts, and in certain cases it is
necessary to identify the oxygen-containing species (oxide type, hydroxyl, etc).

For both chloride and fluoroborate salts, it is possible to consider the addition of a redox buffer to
confer a more reducing environment in the loop and prevent alloy corrosion, as discussed in a previous
report [7]. The redox buffers suitable for chlorides and fluoroborates will likely be different or act

differently from the buffers suitable for fluoride salts.

5.3 REVIEW OF CORROSION DATABASE

The corrosion database for fluoride salts was reviewed in a previous report [7]. The corrosion-
relevant database for chloride and fluoroborate salts is much smaller than the fluoride database, especially
for temperatures above 650°C. The most relevant corrosion results for chloride salts for the purposes of
comparisons are displayed in Table 13. These results do not conform to any expected or predictable
trends. For example, the effect of chromium content in the alloy does not seem to be an important factor,
and the effect of temperature is not clear. Unexpected variability in the tests very likely reflects
variability in the purity of the starting materials and the degree to which impurities were excluded from

the loop during operation. The corrosion rates are rather high for these salts at a relatively low

temperature (~550°C). These rates are similar to those experienced with fluoride salts in contact with
stainless steels and Inconel at ~800°C and are much higher than those experienced with Hastelloy-N in
contact with fluoride salts at temperatures as high as 815°C.

The corrosion database for fluoroborates is shown in Table 14. The improvement in fluoroborate salt
purity during the MSBR program was responsible for a steadily decreasing level of corrosion in tests. The
level of corrosion, ~1 mil/year, was much higher than that seen in comparable tests with fluoride salts but
was judged acceptable for going forward with the MSBR designs. No experience exists with loop
corrosion tests using chlorides or fluoroborates at temperatures approaching the levels anticipated in the
NHI loop. The database for fluorides contains tests in the 800-900°C temperature range with both
Inconel and Hastelloy-N (INOR-8) alloys.

6. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The key finding of this report is that each class of salt—fluoride, fluoroborate, and chloride—
possesses some feature that recommends it for consideration as the NGNP/NHI-loop heat-transfer fluid.
However, certain factors are of overriding importance and permit us to rank candidates in an orderly
fashion. Certain factors that are important (corrosion performance) remain to be determined.

With respect to basic viability as a heat-transfer-loop fluid, NaF-NaBF, can be ruled out on the basis
of a prohibitively high decomposition pressure of BF;. Both KF-KBF, and RbF-RbBF, have acceptable
BF; decomposition pressures at 900°C but also have much poorer heat-transfer metrics. Even these heavy
fluoroborate salts may prove to be impractical because of various nuisance factors described in Sect. 2.1
of this report.

With respect to turbulent-forced-convection heat-transfer performance, the FLiNaK eutectic (454°C)
1s clearly the best salt in Table 1. As a class of salts, fluorides tend to be the best heat-transfer fluids,
followed by fluoroborates, and finally by chlorides. The other obvious fluoride salt choice, the KF-ZrF,
eutectic (390°C), has roughly the same heat-transfer performance as the KF-KBF, eutectic (460°C). All
chloride salts display poorer heat-transfer performance than fluorides (and most fluoroborates). There is

not a great deal of difference in heat-transfer performance between the different chloride salt options.

28
With respect to raw materials cost, chloride salts that contain MgCl, are by far the least expensive.
All fluoroborates, fluorides, and lithium-containing salts have much larger raw material costs. This factor
alone motivates additional work on chlorides if their inferior heat-transfer metrics do not exclude them
from consideration.

There 1s a reasonable expectation (based upon prior experience) that careful alloy design and
intelligent salt-chemistry control will permit a 900°C peak temperature loop to operate with fluoride salts
with a tolerable level of corrosion. Our experience with fluoroborates and chlorides at these temperatures
1s much more limited, and a large degree of uncertainty exists about whether 900°C loop operation can be

achieved with these salts. Such performance must be demonstrated.

The preceding observations lead to the following recommendations:

1. The NGNP/NHI loop design study should exclude the previous choice of NaF-NaBF, as a coolant
option and replace this choice with (a) a chloride salt evaluation or (b) evaluation of KF-KBF,.

2. Because FLiNaK is clearly superior in heat transfer to all other salts in Table 1, there is little
reason to consider other moderately expensive fluoride salts (e.g., KF-ZrF,), unless a lower
melting point is required or a more economical option is identified.

3. [If a single salt had to be recommended for additional study, the ternary eutectic LiCl-KCI-MgCl,
(402°C, 9-63-28 mol %), appears to be the best compromise between raw material cost,
performance, and melting point.

4. There is a need to demonstrate and recommend an improved method for purification of chloride
salts to be used in corrosion tests. This new method should become a purification standard to be
used in conjunction with corrosion tests.

5. High-temperature corrosion tests with properly purified chloride salts should be conducted to
confirm the possibility of using chloride salts in the NGNP/NHI loop. These tests should include
both batch exposures and loop tests and will probably also require the innovative use of redox

buffers to minimize corrosion.
