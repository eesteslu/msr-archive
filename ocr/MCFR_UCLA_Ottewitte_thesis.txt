Configuration of a Moltien Chloride Fast Reactor
on a Thorium Fuel Cycle

to Current Nuclear Fuel Cycle Concerns

by
Eric Heinz Ottewittie
Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering
University of California, Los Angeles, 1982

Professor William B. Kastenberg, Chair

Current concerns about the nuclear fuel cycle seem to center on

waste management, non-proliferation, and optimum fuel utilization

 

(including use of thorium). This {thesis attempts to design a fast
molten-salt reactor on the thorium fuel cycle to address these concerns
and then analyzes its potential performance, The result features

1¢ A simplified easy-to-replace skewed-tube geometry for the core

2. A ve}&-hard neutron spectrum which allows the useful con-
sumption of all the actinides (no actinide waste)

Je Reduced proliferation risks on the equilbrium cycle compared
to conventional fuel cycles because of the absence of car-
cinogenic, chemically-separable plutonium and the presence of
232U which gives a tell-iale signal and is hazardous to work
with

4e A breeding gain in the neighborhood of 0.3

XV
1.0 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Overview of Current Nuclear Politics and Technology
1elel Nuclear Fuel Cycle Problems and Their Politics

In recent years a number of concerns cover the nuclear fuel cycle .
nave arisen. A principal irritant is plutonium (Pu) production in the
existing light water reactor (LWR) uranium fuel cycle and in the fast
breeder (FBR) extension thereto. Concerned individuals fear that the
presence of Pu stockpiles mey promote the proliferation of nuclear
weapons, covertly or overtly, among nationzl and subnzational (eege
terrorist) groups.

In respornse to this concern, President Ford announced that the US
would no longer consider reprocessing of LWR fuel to be a foregone
conclusion. The alternative of course is to stockpile or to bury spent
fuels, thereby creating a problem of actinide waste management, That
would appear to be less than an optimum ecclogical alternative as much

238

of the urenium mined (mostly U) weculd never be used: mining trans-
forms mountain containing 10,000 partis of embedded uranium from natural
to machine - processed state for the recovery of T2 parts fuel, Of
that, reactors consume 7 - 10 parts; a few paris change into plutonium
and the rest currently becomes other -~ actinide waste,

If commercizl FBRs ever appear, the associaied fuel cycle must
21so contend with higher actinides such as americium and curium, Heat
source rate and alvha decay toxicity may economically prohibit their
fabrication into fuel rods,

These and other concerns also influenced President Carier to slow

dovm the plans for commercial FBRs.
1e1e2 Technical Solution: Thorium Fuel Cycle
The thorium fuel cycle solves some of these problems, By
starting with a material which is lower in atomic weight (A=232
vse 238) this fuel cycle eventually produces far less alpha-active
waste (especially carcinogenic and weapons-grade Pu) than the 238U/

233

Pu fuel cycle., Though U from the Th fuel cycle makes justi as

232

good a nuclear explosive, ii 1s always accompanied by U whose

dauchter decay productis emit 2 highly-penetratinz semma radiation.
This makes 233U hazardous to work withe It also signals its location
and transport.
1e143 Technical Solution: Molten Salt Fast Reactor

1ele3e1 Advantaczes of fluid=-uel reactors. Fluid-fuel reactors
continuously add fuel and renmove fission products and require no fuel
refabrication, Molten-salt reactors (MSR) have been more extansively
developed than other fluid-fuel power sysiems. They appear to offer
advantzges in limiting the proliferation of nuclear explosives: the
fuel cycle inventory of weapons~grade maierial outside the reactor is
very small and concentrated at the power plants; little stockpiling
or shipping of weapons-grade fissile materials occurs.
1eT14362 lLatroduction to the MSFR, Beginning shortly after World War
IT but extending into the TO's several laboratories looked at molten
sclt fast reactor (MSFR) concepts, Interest generally followed the
fortunes of the thermal MSR and so has waned in recent y=ars, Through-
out this time, the inherent absence of cladding in an MSR has hinted
of a neutron economy sufficient for breeding,

A thermal reactor doesn't breed easily; it requires careful

design and continuous reprocessing to minimize nonproduciive neutron
caztures in fission products, core sfiructural materials, and control
poisonse An MSFR is not so sensitive; it has no moderator and little
internal siructure. Cl and limited alkali (4ypically Na) are the
lightest materials present. Therefore, the neutron spectum remains
fast and fission products absorb far fewer neutrons,

Numerous workers have already studied the MSFR(U/Pu) as a
breeder, fission product burner, and ulira-nigh, fast-flux fest
facility with very hard neuiron spectrume This thesis systematically
examines the technical bases of !ISFRs and extends MSFR studies into
the thorium fuel cycle, MSFR(Th), seeking 2 system which can maintain
criticality in steady=-state oneration without accumulating actinides
deirimentally.

238U/Pu cycles differ in their neumtron eco-

The Th/233U and the
nomicse As a result, interest in the thermal molten sal{ breeder
reactor (WSBR) has centered on its special usefulness for breeding on
the Th/233U cyclee. Interest in the MSFR has focused on exceptional

2
breeding gain (BG) with the 38

U/Pu cycle [USFR(J/Pu)]: up %o
Oeb= 0e8e For an MSFR (Th) even with an anticipated reduction of 0.2«
O0e3y, BG= 0Oe3~0.5 may be possible,

Though not usually emphasized, the very hard specirum and good

neutron economy of an MSFR offer the prospect of usefully consuming

 

all actinide products: sooner or later all the transactinides fission,
If some capture initizlly, that only (generally) further deforms the
nucleus, thereby increasing the probability of fission, Thus the MSFR
offers strong potential for resolving current concerms, particularly

on a2 thorium fuel cycle,
 

1e2 Historical Review of Molten Salt Activities

The history of the MSR is as old and complex as the history
of nuclear power itself, The ups and downs have followed those
of the parent technology but the swings have been if anything more
violent,

1e241 American Activities
1e2+141 Develoovment of the SR« In 1947 ORNL began a stuly on the
dbhysics, chenistry, and engineering o7 traniume= and thorium=bearinz
molten fluorides, The potential for very high temperatures and power
density interested the aircraft propulsion project.

MSR technology first appeared in the open literature in 1957
(Briant and Weinberg[1]). Next, Bettis, et al. [2,3] and Ergen, et
ale [4] reported on the Aircraft Reactor Experiment: 2 beryllium-—
moderated, thermal reactor fueled with a UF4/NaF/ZrF2 mix and con-
tained in Inconel, This reactor successfully operated in 1954 for
more than 90,000 kihr without incident, at thermal powers up to 2.5
MW and temperatures as high as 1650°F.

This marked the start of an ORNL program to develop 2 thermal
Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (IISBR) for economic civilian power [5].
It included

1. Evaluating the most promising designs

2e Pinpointiry specific development problems

34 Developing materials for fuels, containers, and moderators

4+ Developing components, especially pumps, valves, and flanges

suitable for extended use with molten salts a%t 130000
5. Developing sﬁpplémentary chemical processes for recovering
valuable compenents (other than urenium) from spent fuel:

6. Developing and demcﬁstrafing the maintainability éf aﬁ
MSR’system.

In 1963, Alexander [6] summarized the Cak Ridge development:

l. 1-Z: simplicity of the reacher core and the semicantinucus
fuel handling apparatus lead to low capital costs and in-
creased piant avoiiability.

2. The simplicity and_ccntinuous nature of fissilie and fertile
stream processing methods lead to negligible fuel cycle
ccsts in cn-site p-ants.

3., The negative temper-ature coefficient of regctivity inherent
in the thermal expansicn of the fuel proviaés safety advant-
ages over other reactor cancepts.

L. The internally-~cooled reactor offers competitive nuclear
performance; the externally-cooled reactor, superior per-
formance.

Thié effortALéd tb the design,iconstructioh, androperatlon-gf
the 8~th Molten Sait Reactcr ixperiment (MSRi). Critical operaticn
of the MSRE spanned the period from June 1965 to December 1969, dur-
ing which the reactor accumulated over 13,000 equivalent full-power
hours of operaticn and demenstrated remarkably high levels of opera-
bility, availability, and maintainability. -~

IA recent years, Battelie Nofthwest Laﬁorat&fy (BWWL) has made
critical experiments on MSBR configurations [7], Several United

States miversities have studied the chemistry of molten salts [8].
 

ANL. identified the need [9] for in-pile corrosion testing at high burne
ups to clarify thc effect of noble-metal deposition on container metal,

Presently all work has stopped, A current problem was that
Hastelloy-ll limited the temperatures of the OHRNL MSBR: the additicn
of carbides into the grain boundaries keeps He from forming and
swelling there,but at high temperatures the carbides disappear into
the grains. E. Zeoroski of EPRI feels that the problem with the
MSBR was whether the system parts would hold together very long [10].
142.1.2 Development of the HCFRe Goodman et al [11] proposed a
molten~chloride fast reactor (MCFR) in 1952; Scatchard et al [12]
reviewed the chemical problers invelved. In 1955, Bulmer et 21,

[13] designed and evaluated = 500 MWtk MCFR, exterrnally cooled,

At that time the work was secret and only later decléSsified.
Chlorides of sodium, magnesium, uranium, and plutonium made

up the fuel salt., The blanket was depleted uranium oxide, cocled by
sodium, Thelr report contains numerous irade studies, some still
usefue.

Bulmer chose chlorides over fluorides to limit neutron moder=
ation, However, he felt tkat the strong 35Cl(n,p) reaction would
require enrichment in 37Cl. M, Taube [14=16] of the Institute
of Nuclear Research, Warsaw shared this view, More recently both
Taube [17] and Faugeras [18] have mentioned that fluoride salts may

233

work well with U in a fast reactor in spite of the extra moder—
ation, The MSFR work then shifted to Argonne Nationsl Laboratory
(ANL).

E. Se. Bettis (ORNL) feels that [19] ORNL's look at the MCFR was
very superficial since it was outside their thermal reactor charter.
They meinly criticized the high fuel inventory tied up in the heat
exchanger, Bettis thought that M. Taube had a good idea in direct
cooling (in-core, no fuel circulation) with boiling Hg [20], but

that insufficient quantities of Hg exist. ORNL looked umsuccessfully
at molten lead direct cooling: corrosion proved to be the Achilles
Heel,

In 1967, ANL swmarized [21] the fuel properties and nuclear
rerformance of fast reactors fueled with uranium and plutonium tri-
chlorides dissolved in chlorides of alkalis and alkaline-earths,
Included were the physical and chemical properties of the fuel, and
the heat removal and neutronzcs for one homogenecus reactor and two
internally=cooled reactors, The optimum core volumezfor 1000 MWe
power proved to be 10,000 liters for each types FEach exhibited
favorable characteristics of high breeding ratio, large negative
temperature coefficients of reactivity, and low fuel=cycle cost.
However, the unatiractive characteristics of large plutonium
inventory, large volume, complex design, and container material
problems indicated the need for a sizable program 4to develop the
MCFR(U/Pu).

Recently L. Ee licNeese [22] offered the following comments on
the !CFR:

1« Resistance of Mo to salt corrosion seems to depend directly

on the oxidation states present, as expressed by the "redox"
potentials, This corresponds to the directions of the Swiss

chemiczl research,
2 Re graphite vs. Mo as a structural material: graphite is
2 step up in technology requirements. It is also subject
to radiation damzse. ORNL stopped the engineering on it
for MSBR.

3. Re in=core vs, out-of-core cooling: .inwcore offers lower
inventory (SI), but hizh structural radiation damege. The
extra shielding for out-of-core is inconsequentiale Though
the out—of-core (Pu) version oriers a breeding gain of Q.6
~0s7 to counteract the extra inventory, the economic mea~
sare of interest (a2t least for U/Pu cycles) is approz=
imately 312 BG-1. “n summary out—of-core will be easiest,
but may be less eccaomic in terms of fuel cosis,

FPission product burner concepts are of littie interest:
only 1291 separation has been contemplated.

4. The Swiss molten chloride fast reactor designs presume that
2, stream of aboutl one ppm can be continuously directed for
reprocessing and returned., For this:

a, the chemistry exists (at least for fluorine
systems);

be the engineering ability exists;

ce the smallescale ORNL/MSBR plant was not finished;
and

de scaling up has not been done and would be a sig-
nificant undertakingem— much work to be done,

first, in Poland and later in Switgzerland, looked at a variety of
IISR concepts, primarily on the plutonium cycle. Principal studies
were on

1« A systém of about four fast CFRs and one MSR "burner®

of fission product waste [23]. The overall system con=
sumes its own fission product wastes and still has a
vositive breeding gaine The burner features a thermal flux
trap surrounded by fast reactor molten fuel, The higher the
specific power (IW/1 ) in the system, the lower the steady-
state fission product concentrztion becomes,

2. Optimization of the breeding retio for an HCTR(U/Pu),

theoretically achieving 146 = 148 [241.

The 10 IRl 1-1 power density assumed by Dr. Tauve far exceeds
the 70 - 80ki 1™ technology of ORNLe Thus, little direct ex-
perience applies, Still, L. E. HMcNeese (ORNL) was unable to
immediately foresee any intrinsic difficulty wita 10 M7 171 [22].

Presently, the Swiss work has sfopped, as the electorate
pushes the laboratory from reactor research towards general energy
research and development,

1424242 France, In France, Comme Energe Atomique (CEA) and
Electricite de France (EdF) sponsored development of the MSBR as
backup to the Superphoenix breeder, EdF emphasized lower powers
for near-term feasibility, Their long-term interests included
direct-contact in-core molten-lead cooling. CEA pursued higher
temperatures for long-term application, Their near-term interests

centered on experimental corrosion studies,
 

Fonteray-aux-Roses (CEA) and Pechirney Ugine Kuhlman (PUK)
studied several high temperature UMSR comcepts [18,25,26], a
Th/ 23%U cycle in fast and thermal fluoride-salt reactors and an
MCFR (U/Pu). The MCFR design features in—core cooling (Fig.
1.2-1) and a 7.62 m3 cylindrical core surrounded by a 30 m3
blanket, Table 1.2-I intercompares the main fast and thermal
1Sr. ceneepts of the French.
A CZA/FUK subccmpany, SERS, and Carbenne-Lorraine [27]
carried out experimental studies in 1974-1976 including
1, Tests of the mechanical performance of ihe materials
under tempcrature and radiation
2. Corrcsicn tests in salt at high temperzture
3. Cperaticn of loops at high temperature: one fcr iso-
thermal hydrodynamic studies, a non=isothermal cne with
small flow for heat exchanse studies, and a third non-
isothermal ane for corrosian.

In 1977, if the above results were positive, they were to decide on

a development program whose cbject would be the canstructicn of
a prototype of 25 = 50 Mith,

The American and French atomic organizations were also seek—
ing to agree on the fields of preparation for a 200 Mie MSBR demo-
plant. They were to decide in 1979 on the: construction of this
reactor, depending on the progress with high temperature reactors
and success of the French Superphoenix 1200 M{(e) Liquid Metal
Breeder Reactor (LMFBER).,

would complement the U3 MSBR program; A preliminary study of a

salts. Work on salt chemistry began in 1965; in 1970-1972 the
procram extende< “c include other materials aspects.

Jerkers at Harwell and Winfrith examined three veriants of
£ 25C0 Mie MCFR(238U/Pu) [28-31]: in-core "direct" cooling by
molten lead drops, in—core ccoling by blanket salt passing through
o tubes,and cut-cf-ccre coo-ing.

The direct scheme enccutered too many proclems. The in-ccre
cooling cecncept appeared to warrant further study but the fuel
inventory did not appear to be as low as first thought; also the
high velocities and high pumping pressures presented serious
design problems. ‘The corrosion limits and strength of molybdenum
or its alloys at reactor temperatures representied a large urknown.

With out~of-core cooling, at first the fuel inventory in the
reactor circuit was tco high. Hcwever, compzct layouts and higher
(but still achievable) heat exchanger volumetric ratings reduced
it to within reason. Figure 1.2-2 illustrates the design. The

1e2e3 Summary MSR Statewof-the-Art

Both the 2 Mith ARE and the 8 MWth MSRE demonstrated ex-~
tended successful MSR performance but under conditions less
strenuous than those considered for a 1000 MiWe or MCFR. The
question remains: will a circulating=fuel system hold together
long enough to be practical? ore specifically, how will the
candidate container materials -« Mo alloys, graphite, or compos=
ites with these = hold up at high temperature to corrosion by
the variety of mutants and oxidation states which high burnup
produces? The answer to such questions will come from in-pile
corrosion testing. The French have an on-going experimental
program in such engineering studies, but it may be proprietary.

Much work needs +to be done in developing and scaling up
the reprocessing system.

With out~of=core cooling most of the fuel circulates
outside the core. This threatens the reactor stability. In-
ventory reduction requires compact layouts and high heat

exchanger efficiency,

2,0 ANALYSIS OF CONTEMPORY CONCERNS ABOUT THE NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE

AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS AFFECTING CEOICE OF AN ADVANCED CONCEPT

2e¢1 MNuclear Fuel Cycle Waste Management

One primary facet of the nuclear waste problem is that reactor
operation induces short-and intermediate-lived radiocactivity in
materials which had “een stable or only long-lived radiocactive, The
2clution is to altermatively store the activated materials until they
decay, or to transmute them back into harmless stable or quasi-stable
nuclides, When operation produces nuclides which poison the enviro-
ment 2xnd 1ast long, then ecology prefers the added speed of transe
mutation,

Fuel cycle wastes occur in preparation of the fuel (mill tail-
ings), reactor operation (spent fuel and activation of air and water),
and reactor decommissioning (activation products of strustural
materials), The latter are geperally nonvolatile, bound up in the
structural material, and extremely difficult to release to the
enviroment, even in accident situations, The mill teilings are in-
herently low-ievel, Holdup tanks and stacks with large dilution
factors manage the air and water activations, Managzament of the
spent fuel poses thz major problem: all others pale in comparison.

In the absence of US reprocessing,spent fuel has accumulated
recently such as to saturate the utility storage pools.s To prevent
loss of nuclear generation, DOE plans to find away-from-reactor
storage capacity for 810 MT of spent fuel by 1984 and at least
25,000 NT by 1996, Foreign spent fuel will add to these require=-

ments [32]e

16
24141 Characterization of.Spent Fuel Wastes

Fissian products and transmuted actinides emit most of the
radiatian in spent-fuel, Some of these radioisotcpes exist for
long. times, comparable with a human life span. Those with half-
life of a few to 50 years are particularly hazardous because they
radiate faster than the longer-~lived ones. How lang each element
remains in a human or animal depends on 1ts biological-elimination
half-life, which may be very long.

Some half-lives exceed the life span of our society. A concern
then arises that nuclear power might burden the genera?ions to come

with accumulated waste, part-cularly the transactinides (Figure

2.1.1.1 Cases. Spent fuel gases generally include He and T2 from
ternary fissicn, Hz, Dz, T2, and He frcm charged-particle-out thresn-
cid reacticns, and fissicn procduct gases {Xe, Kr, and Iz). In either
a molten salt fuel or in disscluticn of a solid fuel, gases serarate

Cf these only 3H, 1291, 85Krm, and 3601 (in order of increasing
hazard) have half-lives long enough tc warrant processing: the rest
just require short-term holdup before releasé to the atmosphere,

Low hazard tritium relatively emits only weak radiation; its
maximum allowable concentration is amang the highest far any
radicactive material. Furthermore the body excretes it rapidiy end

it cannct tioclegicaily ccncentrate in the envircnment, in feood chains

18
or in man. It decays with a 12.3 years half-life to harmless helium
and thus poses no Lcng term hazard. It also has applicatien for the

fusion prcgram. Nevertheless, it must be manitored and is hard to

contain.

8 -
SKrm has a similar half-life but is far more toxiz. A4s an
inert gas, it is easy to isclate. Both 12912 and 36012 gases
might be returned to the reactor as halide salt. There they will

most likely transmuie to harmless 3701 and lBOKr.

2.1.1.2 Solid fissicn products. Storage for about a year (TFig.
2.1-2) reduces most fissicn product radioactivity to more manage-—
atle amounts. Cf the remaining radioisotcpes the most hazardous are
thcse which metzbolize and beccme a part of living crganisms, and

decay with half-iives comparable to a human life-span.

2.1.1.3 Actinides. Management of actinide wastes has caused
much controversy in recent years [35-49], Their long half-life
makes actinides a quasi-permanent burden unless one can transmute or
otherwise remove them from the enviroment, Alpha-emitters threaten the
most , particularly when ingested. Plutconium is the worst of these:
inside the body it seeks out and locates on banes, which makes it
carcinogenic. Secticn 2.1.1.4 discusses this further,

Most aétinides though usually in zn unwieldy form can also

be used for weapons Sectien 2.2 analyzes this.

2.1.1.4 Unique biological hazard of plutonium [50]. Most chemical
elements react chemically with biclogical systems, some of them
detrimentally. Cthers may be safe in elemental form, but not as
compounds. Individual isotopes can also harm living matter by einlt~
ting dangerous radiation. All the isétopes of actinide elements
radiate. Plutonium predominates amang these elements because it
comprises five quasi-stable isotcpes and constitutes the first
significant element above starter uranium on the A scale.

The main isotopes of plutonium, in order of decreasing
importance are 239Pu, 2L‘OPu, 2hlPu, 238Pu, and 242Pu. This reflects
their usual cencentraticns and activity rates. In high-burnup
LMFBR fuel, Pu-241 presents the principal short-term hazard (Table
2.1-1), 239by emits 5.15 leV alpha particles which range only
3.6 cin in air and less than L5/f&m in water. In each ionizing
collision with air or water meolecules, the alpha leses 35 eV.

After about 120,000 collisians, it has lost all of its kinetic
energy. It then stops, captures two electrcns, and changes into
a peutral helium atom. Noble gas helium does not affect tke

human body.

Cutside the human body the alpha radiation poses no threat:
5.1 MeV alpha-particles can penetrate the skin from outside only
to a depth of hé/Ukm. This is still within the epidermis layer
which regenerates very quickly.

The short track length of an alpha~particle in living tissue
concentrates the energy abscrption in a relatively small volume

thereby increasing its affect. Thus to compare toxicity of alpha

with the well-known results for X-rays one must multiply the energy
absorptian for alpha-particles by the "Quality Factor", varying from
10 to 50.

The most dangerous situation arises ‘when plutaniwn eaters tae
human body. Alpha-particles can then penetrate into the tissues to
a depth of AS’}Anu Tissues generally are shielded by mémbranes,
but these are thirner than l‘}i.m.

As water ccmprises mcre than 70% by weight of human tissue,
the icnizing penetraticn prucduces hyd-ogen perecxfide tarcugh radio;
ysis. Peroxide acts as a very strang poisen inside living tissue:
Ithrough a series of chemical reactians it changes the structiurs in
the enzymes which catalyze biochemisiry insicde the livingcells
Prolongéd irradiaticn by alprha-particles also deforms:nucleic acids,
the carriers of genetic informaticn.

Cur widest experience concerning biolcgical effects of alpha
emitters is with ﬂéRa. Seventy years of handling suggests taat
the body burden limit for occupatianal exposure tc it be 0.1 ‘}LCi
(O.lupLg). Experiments an dogs and other animal; indicate that

Pu produces about five times greater biological effect.

Plutonium, like calcium, strantium, radium, and cerium, forms
non-saluble phosphates which deposit in the bonas. For these elements

the skeletan is the "critical" organ.
,ggluﬁggigﬁ binds strengly to the sialprotein on the bane surface;
the most abundant component cf bone, callagen, does not bind plutanium

to any significant extent. This localizaticn is what makes 239py

23
 

Q
so carcinogenic. The lowest average dose rate of 23’Pu in bones
causing death of rats from osteosarcoma was 57 rad (about 15 times
less than the lethal dose rate from 9OSr).
In contrast thorium and uranium exhibit low radiocactivity. Alpha-
. 232U 233 . . .
emitters and U also endanger biological systems but they don't

"seek bones" like plutonium. This recommends a Th/233U fuel cycle
over a 238U/Fu cne.

2.1.2 Management of Spent Fuel Wasties

One can either store long—lived spent fuel wastes or transmute
them into non-=hazardous products: +those which are stable or near-
stable, or which shortly deccy into same (Figure 2.1-3). Studies
to date would transmute wast2 in Controlled Thermonuclear Reactors
[ 52-55], the Savannah River Plant high-flux production reactors
[56,57], power reactors [56=60], accelerators [61], and others
[62-64]. Taube [23] and others [hd] have shown that, of the trouble~

90Sr and 13705 most resist transmitation:

some radiation emitters,
they have low cross sections (¢ 1 barn) for thermal neutron capture
transmutation into 91Zr and 138Ba. However, a thermal flux trap in
a fast molten salt reactor could provide sufficiently high flux to
reduce the effective half lives from 29 and 30.1 years down to 2 and
9 years, respectively {23]. A solid fuel reactor could not do this
because of technical limits on specific power.

Sometimes, the same properties which rendsr an isotope hazard-

- . . . s 0
ous, also make it attractive as a commercial radiatlon source. 7 Sr

and.137Cs are examples. However, commercial demand does not threat-

en to exceed supply.

Actinide "wastes" accumulate when nuclides resiét fission-
ing; Figure 2.1-4 indicates the prominent actinides of the Th
and U fuel cycles and their fission {,endencies. More explicitly
Figure 2.1-5 shows that fission génerally does not predominate over
capture until rather high neutron energies are reached. However,

&; does exceed o, for 23 L‘U at mich lower energies tha.ri for other
actinides. Thus, a verv fast snectrur reactor, esoecially cn the
therium fuel evele can uniocuely zvaid accumulatine actinides.

According to their median flux energies (Tabie‘ 2.1-I1), fast re-
actors must have many more neutrons above the F‘iguré 2¢1=5 crossover
points than thermal reactors., MSFRs which minimize neutron
mederaticn (elastic scé.tter;ng) will have the hardest neutrcn
spectrum of all power reactors. Reactors with highly-enriched
fuels (Table 2,1-II) will also exhibit a faster spectrum: en-
richment eliminates from the core 23 8U or 23 2Th, which primarily
undergo inc].a:.‘bic_ scatter.

In considering the reactivity contribution of each nuclide
note that the reactivity crossover point in Figure 2.1-5 where

N = ’ng:. / O‘c exceeds 1, will occur at even lower energies

(roughly where S¢/6. =0.3-0.4). Thus, nuclides usually considered
as actinide wastes do not severely detract from criticality or

breeding gain potential in a very fast spectrum reactor.

2e2¢1 Development of US Policy

US nuclear energy policy was from the first based on a Keen
awareness of the dangerous aspect of nuclear electric power, The
Acheson=Lilienthal Revort of 1946 saw a close association between
the civilian and military aspecis of nuclear energye. It recommendec
international ownership of nuclear explosive materials,

The related US proposal to the United Nations failed in part
because the Soviet Union would net participate, After that the U5
withdrew into a periocd of secrecy. Eventually we became more relaxed
about the development of nuclzar energy for peaceful purposes and
abandoned the secrecy. Because we mistakenly thousghi civilian
reactor safeguards could be stretched to cover the more danzerous
elements in the fuel cycle ~ such as plutonium renrocessing - we
allowed plans for the use of plutonium fo go forward unhampered.
There is where the damage was done [65].

In 1957 the International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA was estab;
lished primarily to monitor the flow of commercial nuclear materials
and equipment among member countries, The charter advocates conirol
over “excess" quantities of plutonium, but does not restrict their
use,

The nuclear policymakers of the fifties and the sixties
apparently did not realize the security implications of easy access
to nuclear explosive material in national stockpiles., The prospect
of many nations possessing substantial nuclear explosive materials

seemed very far away, A4lso, nuclear weapons were thoughi to be

29
enormously difficult to design and fabricate, The US near-monopoly
on the technology, fuels, and equipment for civilian nuclear power
activities worldwide seemed to ensure US control of the situation,
Fledgling nuclaar power programs seemed to be unrelated to the devel-
opment of nuclear weapons., The earlier prescience of the Acheson-
Lilienthal group that they had everything to do with it was ignored.

There was also some genuine confusion on the technical side.

It was once widely thought, for exemple, that you could not make
nuclear weapons with plutonium derived from spent power reactor fuel,
The Acheson-Lilienthal report seems to have misled many, including
the IAEA into believiang you could denature ovlutonium. As 2 result,
many of those responsible for protection against military diversion
of plutonium were relying upon technological barriers which did not
existe

On October 28, 1976, President Ford concludéd that "avoidance
of proliferation must come before economic interests"e Therefore,
we should defer reprocessing until "there is sound feason to conclude
that the world community can effectively overcome the associated
risks of proliferation.”

Two factors contributed to Ford's decision and to the sub-
sequent development of President Carter's non=proliferation policy.
The first is how the safeguards deficiency impacts international
security: we cannot control the plutonium or highly-enriched uranium
of other nations should they suddenly decide to abrogate agreements
and aprropriate explosive material for weapons. At the same time

the extensive zrorth of the nuclear industry, worldiride, is increasing

30
the availability of plutonium,

The second factor affecting current policies is the dubious
economics of reprocessing and recycle of plutonium in light water
reactors, This makes the early introduction of plutonium into
international irade as unnecessary as it is dangerous,

Presidents Ford and Carter both advocated that we restrict
access to dangerous materials, pause in the commitment to plutonium
separztion and use, znd search for alternatives to national stocke-
piling, Their efforts to persuade our allies and trading partners
mct at best, with mixed success, It is hardly surprising that this
US policy shift on plutonium produced widespread irritation, alarm,
and even the cynical suggesiion fthat the Americans were less inter=-
ested in proliferation than in perpetuating a commercial advantage,

Both Britain and France have emphasized the security advantages
of their reprocessing plans, The British suggest that if reprocessing
does not relieve the accumilation of spent fuel, non-nuclear-weapon
states will have to develop indigenevus reprocessing facilities:
this will certainly pose a serious danger of proliferation, Britain
argues that the best way to discourage this development is to confine
reprocessing services to the states which already have the bomb [66],

Carter subsequently submitted a bill, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Act of 1977« It would impose stricter rules on US nuclear exports
which would block their use for explosives., Opposition to this act
argued that whatever relationship exists cannot be reversed and that
it is so remote that further controls aren't necessary,

Sam }icDowell of DOZ Safeguards and Security has defined non-pro-

3
liferation as prevention of weapons capability in a nonweapons
state [67]s The goal of an alternmate fuel cycle would be to deter
or reveal diversion such that suitable time would be provided which
allowed other countried to negotiate or induce that country to stop,.

Zebroski of EPRI has suggested [10] that the primary objective
should be to seek improved resistance to diversion from civilian
power fuel cycles,

The heart of the controversy lies in the access to nuclear
explosive materizls which the nuclear eleciric power indusiry pro-

vides, Section 2,2,2 discusses +this further,

242.2 Relationshiv Between Nuclear Electric Power and

Nuclear Weapons Development

The ﬁ.S. generally prodﬁces plutoﬁium for weapons purposes in
large special purpose reactors and separates it from fhe irradiated
fuel in govermment reprocessing plants. However, nuclear power
generation electricity also produces plutonium; commercial spent
fuel reprocessing planis will separate it, physically creating large
stockpiles, Also the same technolozy (and in some cases the same
plants) which enrich uranium for fuel can also enrich it further for
Wweapons use,

The essential point is this: getting the requisite explosive
material iz still the most difficult and time-consuming item in the
initial vroduction of nuclear weapons,* The operation of civilian
nuclear power reactors and plants for fissile fuel geparation and/or

enrichment tend to remove this bottleneck, Then if a country has

32
prevared secretly in advance, it can quickly manufacture nuclear
warneads once it decides to do sn,.

This is now a real threat, not present when the basic internate
ional rules for nuclear itrade were formulated twenty years ago. The
reason is that the civilian nuclear power industry has grown enorme
ouslye. By any reasonable measure (the plutonium production rate or

the size of urenium enrichment facilities being wufilized), it exceeds

the scale of the worldfs military nuclear orozramse In fact, in most
countries the quantities of plutonium is spent reactor fuel, if sep-
arzted out and stored, will dwarf any plausible military needs,
2.2.2.1 Txtent of the svent fuel problems Over the next decade Zurope
and Japan plan to send 3 G3 (2etric kilotons) of spent fuel tc Winde
scale, La Hague reportedly will process about 6 Gg sﬁent fuel for
Japan, the Federal Republic of Germany , Sweden, Switerland, Bel=-
gium, Holland, and Austria, This means separating about 75 Mg (metric
tons) plutonium, or enough for about 10,000 nuclear weapons. Clearly
heavy financial investments ride on the cutcome: when transport
charges are included, the Buropean contracts represeni almost three
billion dollars in business. The intense internafional competition

in nuclear commerce, accompanied by heavy investment and national

pride, tends to obscure the proliferation threat,
2.2.2,2 Question of reprocessing. [32,65,66], Current U,S, policy
supports the relatively safe fuel cycle activities and discourages
the more dangerous ones. A primary U,S,. imperative is to promote come
mon rules for internmational nuclear trade, But before formulating
rules, much less implementing them, one mmst ascertain just what is
dengerous and just how much the spread of nuclear weazons threatens
individual countries and world security. Clearly 2 common understand-
ing does not yet exist, as witness US opposition to Buropean export
sales of pluitoniun reprocessing and uranium enrichment_facilitieso

Recent U,S. Administratisns have shunned reprocessing. Many
analysts [68] believe this directly increases the risks of both
diversion and proliferation, With no reprocessing, the increasing
amount of long-cooled spent fuel, and the increasing number of lo-
cations with such fuel [69] increase diversion risks, The likeliw
hood of "proliferation" increases because concern for a reliable
supply stimulates development of independent enrichment capabilities,

The capability to develop fissile production now exists in fifty
countries, with 10~20 additionzl possible in the next decade [70;71].
A secure fuel supply and reprocessing service through international
commerce would economically discourage these countries from devel-
oping their own., The economic inhibition is substantial since initial
small-scale operations are highly unecomomic relative to ma?ure MAN U=
facturing and production capabilities in supplier countries,

Section 2.2.5 examines the vulnerability of different fuel

cycles to diversion,
Pe2e2¢3 Attitudes on return of Pu, Of prime importance to pro-
liferation is the question: who gets the bred Pw —the reprocessor
or the spent fuel owner? If plutonium eventually displaces uranium
as the primary fuel for power reactors, how can indigenous repro-
cessing be successfully discouraged outside the nuclear weapon
states or a big suppliers club? The goal, long-sought by many,

of fuel "independence'" does not equate to simply shifting fuel
dependence from the United States to Europe, These

commercizl and political pressures, which earlier led to reprocessing
ccuid yet force Fu return even witihcut adequate internaticnal
rrctecticn against preliferazicn.

Presently ncn-Zuratom countries need US permissicn beth to
transfer US-supplied spent fuel to cther reprocessoré like “ind—
scale and La Hague and to get Pu back. Pu can return cnly "under
conditions that...warn the U5 of any diversion well in advange of
the Yime" diverted ﬁaterial could be transformed into weapons.
Ingland has pledged the material will be rsturned to ils owners
"enly in a form that will reduce the risks" of proliferation. In
his report cn the ‘/indscale inquiry, British Judge Parker took
refuge in time: 'this matter can be alleviated to some extent

oy technical fixes", he wrote.

35
2.2.3 Which Reactor Fuel Contains the Least Proliferaticn Danger?

All reactors either produce Pu or 2'33U, or start with fully-
enriched 235U. Thus weapans—grade fuel is intrinsically recover-
able from all reactor fuel cycles. However, which fuel attracts
nationalist and subnational groups the least as a weapon? The
answer may depend on unraveling complex interrelated factors,
whicn are examined here,
2.2.3.1 Veapons-grade material. For 233U or 235U, weapons grade
means isotopic content enrichment in U exceeding 12 or 20%,
respeptively. In the broad sense weapcns~grade means any material
which can undergo chemical :eparatia to yield Pu or the uranium
enrichments menticned above. Thus dilution with any other element

including thorium does not lower the weapons grade as chemistry
can separate out the U again.

At one time it was thought that reactor-grade plutonium (pro-
duced in thermal reactors) was not of weapons grade [66]s The U,.S.
covernment has now stated unambiguously that they have produced and
successfully tested militarily important nuclear weapons, using
reactor srade plutonium. Even simpnle weapon designs reliably produce
highly powerful (kiloton) explosions.

Similarly; the TARA Safeguards Technical Manual now provides the
following cuidance: plutonium of any grade, in either metal, oxids
or nitrate form can be out in a form suitable for the namufacture of

nuclear explosive devices in a2 matter of days to weeks [65].

36
 

2.2.3.2 Unique 23 2U Daughter Radiatian. All weapons-~grade fuel
can be left in a highly-radiocactive state (by means of fission
products). The associated biological hazérd would then discourage
its use by subnational weapon makers. Special national labor-
atories,could readily clean these up bui ever-present 23 2U inpur-
ity in 233U will continue to decay into hazardecus ‘(-emitters (Sec.
3.5.4). In less than a week after high level decontamination, the
233

gamma activity in recovered Th and U becomes so great that
fabrication by direct methods can be permitted anly on a scheduled
radiation dosage basis [72].

The characteristic har ‘-gamma signal cf the daughter

radiation also reveals the location and transport of this material.

depends on how long the imploded configuration stays together.
Multiplied source neutrons fram spantaneous 21”0Pu fissians cause
gearly energy r;alease which produces a premature disassembly.
This greatly reduces the' total energy yield of the devics.
Cansequently, a military might shun hizh burnup plutonium

(high in %%Pu), but a subnational group might still desire it.
In pure actinide metal only spaitanecus fissian can con—

tribute copious source neutrons. However actinide compounds pro—
duce intrinsic preignition-triggers through (o ,n) reactions.

2424345 Denaturing and other technical fixes [32], One technical
fiz, the Civex process, has received a fair amount of international
attention, It returns pluftonium to the customer in the form of
fabricated fuel containing enough radioactive products 4o preclude
easy chemical exfraction of bomb material, However, within a few
years after leaving the reactor, radioactivity decay forfeits this
protection, Since most spent fuel reprocessed in this century will
have cooled for even longer than that, the Civex process cannot
contribute to the solution of the problems we must worry about now,.
Civex also must face other problems, Industry will resist
irradiated fuels becaﬁse ther increase occupational and public
health exposures, Likewise the owners of the material, especially
foreign countries, are not likely to accept the dictates of the
reprocessor on the form in which plutonium is to be returned to
them, This would also argue against indusitrial recycle of solide

233

form “°°U daughters).

The simplest answer to denaturing the BG export from an MCFR
will be to take it directly from the core; fission products, Y -
emitters.and all.

2024346 Summarye It remains yet to say if there exist any signif-
icant proliferation differences among any of the fuels, Ve can
categorize them as follows:

With sub-weapons—grade materials does little to limit proliferation:

Thus, in summary,no "proliferation~proof™ fuel exists,but
the Th/233U cycle does offer some advantages over the U/Pu one:
the presence of 232U daughter radiation and the absence of carcin=-
ogenic Pu,.

26244 The Sicnificance of Stockpiles

2e2ele1 Peaceful vs, military explosives, The Nonprolifleration
Treaty forbids non-nuclear-weapon states to acquire nuclear exploe-
sive devices, whether labelled military or peaceful (they blow up
the same way). Peaceful explosive services could still be provided
under sirict international physical control,

The same rules should apply to something very similar, a dis-
assembled bomb, That being so, what about the nuclear explosive
material itself? The only answer consistent with the Treaty's

prohibition on nuclear explosive devices is = don't label it "peace=-

42
ful" until you prove you can safeguard it [65].

2.2.4.2 What about unsafeguarded production reactors? [65]s It is
contended for example, that no country choosing to build nuclear
weapons would turn to its civilian power reactors for the requisite
explosive materials; to divert material in this way would risk detec-
tion by the IAEA inspectors, and in addition would provide too poor
a grade of plutonium to interest weaponeers, Under this self-serv-
ing theory, if weapons material is wanted, a special~purpose unsafe=
guarded reactor would be built, I% is possible at the moment to do
this legally in countries noi pariy to the Nonproliferation Treaty
and therefore not subject to inspection of all its indigenous nuclear
facilities. This underlines fthe need to exterd the req;iggments of
the freaty to nmonsignatory nations by conditioning nﬁclear trade on
acceptance of internafional agreemenﬁg and inspection on all nuclear
activities within importing countries.

There is increasing pressure to do this, and a recent bill be-
fore the Congress would make this a condition for U.S. nuclear ex~
portse

Even if legal, however, the construcfion of a special purpose
plutonium production reactor signals a country's intention to build
bombs and, in the present climate, risks premeture interception of
its attempt to obtain explosive materizl for nuclear weaponse.

To avoid interference, a country mighi stockpile separated

 

plutonium from spent power plant fuel openly and legally. A dew-
fense establishment can design and fabricate a bomb in privacy;

the illegel activity is then confined to a swift, almost one-

43
 

sten process: appropriation from its storage place of the nec-
essary plutonium, fabrication, and insertion into the waiting bomb,
It is surely the quickest, cheapest, and least risky route to nuc;
lear weapons. So long as individual nations are permitted to kggg
nuclear explosive stockpiles they are in effect, in possession of
an optiorn to make nuclear weapons almost literally overnight,

In other words, from the moment spent reactor fuel is trans-
lated into sevarated plutonium and stored, the element of "timely"
warning, on which our present safeguards system has been relying,
evaporates, The same is true, of course, for stockpiles of highly
enriched uranium,

It is important to understand that so far as safeguards are
concerned a stock of nuclear erxplosive material is ailot more like
a2 bomb than it is like a reactors No one would dream of suggest-
ing that nuclear explosive devices, regardiess of how labelled,
should be exported under international safeguards, The Nonprolif=
eration Treaty settled once and for all the notion that nuclear
explosives came in two categories - pilitary and peaceful, Under
the treaty no such distinction is permitted. Yet strip away the
electronics and the conventional high explosives and label the
plutonium as intended for peaceful purposes and many nmuclear spokes-
man, at home and abroad, will tell you that if subject to occasional
inspections it is a perfectly safe proposition: just like safe=
guarding power reactors [65]e

The worldwide opportunities for diversion are clearly dominated

by the existence of large volumes of spent fuel stored in many hun-
dreds of locations, and especially long = cooled spent fuel which is
not returned to supplier countries [10],

The crux of the proliferation issue is not to completeliy avoid
Pus. Due to advanced technology, any country can produce it without
resoriing to nuclear power cycles, Rather it is to aveid having
Pu lie around in larze quantities where diversion is less detectable,
In an MCFR(Pu), Pu is always in solution, except for that fuel which
is required to start a new reactor. Reprocessing is done within
the plant boundaries continously and the Pu then fed back into the

system,

45
 

24245 Fuel Cycle Vulnerability to Diversion

The opportunity for national or subnational diversion of
weapons—grade material will depend on the size of the fuel cycle
inventorye Transport outside secure boundaries and decentraliz=
ation of the inventory enhances the potential for subnational
diversion: while under transport the material will be in a more
easy-to-handle form and probably under less security; decentrali-
zation also implies less security.

2.2451 Once=throush fuel cycle. Figure 2,2-1 diagrams the trail
of weapons-grade material in a once-through fuel cycle, assuming
that the initial fuel elements are low=enrichment U. After gener-
ation in the reactor, it passes through about three storage/queue
depotss Possibly one more storage depot labelled 'permanent" may
appear later, once it is fixed what that will be, Only one out-of
plant transfer may be necessarye The inventory in the long term
storage depots will grow with time, eventually becoming very large.
Although the Pu there is not separated out, a national laboratory
could easily do so,

One should also note the presence of the enrichment plant:
though it doesn't produce weapons grade-material for this fuel cycle,

it could,

232.5.4 To reprocess or not 1o reprocess, The once-~through fuel
cycle, starting with low~enrichment U, seems to display fairly low
vulnerability to subnational diversion, but creates a cumulating
stockpile available for national use, It also creates a long~term
waste management problem and poorly uses our resources,

The molien. salt fuel cycle clearly seems to be less vulnerable
than the solid-fuel reprocessing cycle. On the present rough scale,
the molten salt fuel cycle must be rzted as comparable to the
"once=through" in vulnerability,

The question now occurs = would you export an MSR with its
in-plant fuel cycle capability to a non-weapons state? Or, a
different question: which would you export, the "once-through"
or the "molten" fuel cycle? Assuming that you could alter the MCFR
to make Pu from 238U but that also the non-weapons state keeps
its spent fuel from a2 once-through cycle (see section 2.2,2,3),
either cycle is bad for national proliferation, This seems 1o
say forget about exporting unless you can maintain control: IAEA,
US, or guuer,

On the domestic scene, the reduced market would definitely
favor the "molten" cycle as it solves more problems and makes more

fuel economically available,

50
 

2e2e5¢5 To breed or not to breed, Assuming that the potential
1o breed excess plutonium or highly=-enriched 233U exists, one
must next ask - should we? The alternative is fto use the excess
neutrons to achieve higher fission product levels, a smaller
critical mass, or some other benefit,

Breeding obviously provides initial fuel for starting up
other reactors, The alternative is to start [CFRs up with Pu
from spent LWR fuel, or highly-enriched 235U. But either of
the latter two fuels would make it easier to manufacture weapons,
Also they would cause the thorium fuel cycle in this reactor to
depend on -=he U/Pu fuel cycls, With a system of thermal MSRs

the export 233U BG could be dilubed below weapons grade, but

238U diluent ﬁould evene

Th diluent is chemically separable and
tuzlly mean Pu production,

Based on these considerations, this study seeks a breeding
MCFR. Only the first genmeration of MCFR(Th) reactors should then
nge@ ?35U or Pu for startun.
2e2e5¢5 Fusion reactor vulnerability. Lest anyone think that
fusion reactors are the panacea, note that the current literature is
full of fissile breeding ideas; producing weaponsw-grade 233U or Pu,
In the US, current thinking regards such a hybrid as neeessary to a

near-term economical reactor, In the USSR it is their prime goal,

51
2.3 el Utilization
2.3.1 Barth's Resources

209 (Z = 83) nature offers on earth only the chemical

Beyond
elements thorium and uranium (Z = 90 and 92). Only these two
materials, in present, or feasibly-transmuted form, can sustain
a neutron=induced fission chain reaction.

Only 0.72% of U is 235U. The enrichment process loses some of
that. Present reactors, without recycle, consume just 10% of the
235U before assizning the rest to semipermanent siorage, Thus we
presently waste 9Ge 94% of the uranium mined, an affront io the en-
vironment. If, instead, the reactor could usefully consume ail of
the actinide, considerably less eyesore and mining expense would
result. Bconomics might then justify the retrieval of extensive
low=grade ores. At a time of energy shortage the present policy
seems foolhardy except that 1t reflects the restrictions posed by
economics, proliferation concern, and spent fuel waste management.
These must first be overcome.

Thorium abounds three times as much as uranium in the earth's
crust, and offers that much more nuclear fuel energy. The avail-
abie uranium ores increase greatly if one includes not only the
classical ores { »1000. ppm uranium) but the very abundant granites
with 80 ppm uranium and thorium, GCranite is the main constituent
of the earth's crust (up to 20 km deep). Extraction from these
ores could become economical if fission reactors fully used all the
Th and U present. Together with fusion reactors, such a fuel cycle

would then open up all the principal world resources of nuclear fuel.

52
2¢342 Use of Thorium

Nature has significantly inhibited the use of Th by not pro-
viding a thorium isotope which can sustain a neuiron chain reaction,
Despite some unique advantages of a Th/233U cycle over a U/Pu one;
Th use must still prove its economicse A reactor which yields high
BG in the Th cycle would help a lot.

High melting points hinder reprocessing of 2 solid Th fuel:
Tho, melts at 3050°C; Th metal, at 1750°C. Breeding is very mar-
ginal, except with a fast reactor. Reducing non-productive neutron
captures (ee.ge to fission products, core structural materials, and
control poisons) vecomes crucial, That suggests fluid fuel reactors:
they can continuously remove fission products while adding fuel on-
ling, and some variants require no core structure.

2e¢3¢3 Intercomparison of Reactor
Concepts with Regard to Fuel Utilization

Much attention currently centers on optimum uranium usage by
candidate reactor concepts, The parameter of Megawatt days of
electric energy produced per mined metriq ton of uranium (MWde/
mined HTU) provides a suitable yardsticke Note that the numerator
includes energy production from thorium while the denominator ignores
thorium consumption, Consider as a benchmark that all the uranium
were somehow (ideally) consumed, Then without any energy production
from Th, the rating would be 380,000 MWide/mined MTU, The advanced
concepts in Table 2,3-I, currently under study in the US, do not
come anywhere near this idealistic figure; not even when including

energy production from The

Zebroski [10] concludes that the evolutionary extension of
LWR burnup offers the best near-ferm hope for improving usage,
However, higher burnup will also produce greater statistical vari-
ations in fuel failure, which will limit these extensions, On the
long term, an MCFR should come much closer or exceed the ideal
limit because all actinides are consumed and it requires only thor=
ium feed (except for startup fuel on early reactors),

2e3e4 Use of Both Th and U Reserves

One might desire that any new reactor concept be able to
operate on both the Th and U cycle, so as to evenitually allow use
of all our reserves, MCFR siudies have already indicated large
potential breeding gaint on the U/Pu cycle, providing Pu is accept-
able, In that event, one could also supply spent U fuel as blanket

feed, thereby solving that waste management problem,

2.4 Strategic Security

strategic security has its place on the 1list of contemporary concerns

due to current events:

stemming from problems of cities, alienation of extremist
groups, and, again, have-nots,

might be successfully argued that fat men doﬁ't look for

with the disappearance of the cheap oil~fired energy source, Thus the

WQES,

Wetd like to think the MCFR is it, Until that becomes more

though, it would be well {0 secure our US energy supply

irom all threat,
2.4.1 Present Susceptibility

At present, US energy supplies, key to our might and resource-
fullness, are all above board (ground level) for everyone to see
and aim at. This includes dams, oil tankers and depots, fossil-
fuelled plants, and nuclear reactors. Actually only the containe
ment building of the latter protrudes above ground but that still

leaves it vulnerable.

2eliel.l Subnational Blackmaile Should a terrorist group seek a
pmeans of national blackmail, the threat of destruction to a dam
or a nuclear plant might seem credible.

Given sufficient explosire a dam would seem to be a better
target, both in size and certainty cf wreaking financial havoc.
L¥R destruction would likely cause more perscnal injury. A fossil =
fuelled plant destruction would not necessarily threaten public
lives., Bombing a city or a poisonous gas {like ohlorine) plant

might pose the next largest threats.

2.:.1.2 Sabotage. In time of war or unrest, sabotage to our sys—
tem could rear its ugly head. Surprise attacks might often occur.
In addition to the above targets, one might then add many more ncn-
nuclear possibilities such as poisoning water systems or destroying
any energy supply. For sheer havoc, though, destroying all water,

supply.to LWR cores as well as their containment would do well.

o1
 

2.4.1.3 War. In event of war, sabotage could be one front of the
attack. In addition planes and missiles might be directed at nu-
clear plants in hopes of accomplishing what the aggressor didn't
want to or couldn't send an atomic bomb to do: perhaps an atomic
blast would have destroyed a valuable industrial complex whereas
an LWR core release will simply harm and demoralize a lot of

people.
2.L.2 Potential Remedy with an MSR

The dominant vulnerability of the above energy sources would
seem to be the presence of the potential hazard above or near the
earth's surface. Moving the nazard lower mitigates the danger.
Dams can't go underground. Nuclear power plants can, but it costs
a lot. An MSR uniquely offers

(1) Continucus removal of the principal hazard from the sys-

tem: +the gaseous and volatile fission products. One can
store these far underground in a recessed tank for security.

(2) Ability to transfer the whole core further underground

at a moment's notice to a (possibly natural convection-)
cooled holding tank.
Thus the MSR may allow the security advantage of underground siting

without all the costs and other difficulties.

58
 

2elie Summar

Analysis suggests that an LWR may be a likely target for atiack
or threat of attack. The goals of such an attack would be

(1) Destruction of the energy production capability

(2) Release of gasecus and volatile fission products into

the air.

This threai to energy and peopie probably exceeds that from a
dam which tends to be located farther from people. Also water must
follow the lay of the land, which authorities could observe and some -
what predict. Transport of fission product gases, they could not very
well .

At the same time, nuclear plants can be the toughest nuts to crack
as they are more compact and self-contained. With a little more hard-
ening, such as an MSR allows, they could be America's energy ace-in-
the hole and basis for survival.

On the long term the MCFR and all other novel concepts should be
explored and re-explored for their ability to provide that panacea of
a cheap abundant energy source = a far betier means of dealing with

yon hungry Cassius than any protective shells one can devise.

2.5 Summary Design Principals for an Advanced System
2e9e1 Waste Management Restraints

Spent fuel contairs several products whose activity remains
high after a years storage, Of these, the alpha~emitters can extenw
sively damage intermals when ingested, Plutonium presents a special
hazard because it locates on bones: the whole skeleton of man be-
comes the critical organe. Although our society has learned how to
handle other toxic industrial wastes (arsemic, mercury, chlorine),
control is not perfect and accidents have occurred. Thus, we prefer
to avoid plutonium production if that does not severely curiail
our energy production, A reactor whicn usefully consumes all <he
actinides and has nil Pu in its system would seem very atiractive,

2652 Mon-proliferation Restrainis

Despite earlier misconceptions plutonium of any grade can be
put in a form suitable for the manufacture of nuclear explosive
devices in a matter of days to weeks, Thus, from the moment a
non-weapons state separates plutonium from spent reactor fuel and
stores it, the element of "{imely warning", on which our present
sateguards system relies, vanishes,

The same holds true of course for stockpiles of highly enriched
(in 2337 or 25y) uranium, Thus 259U or 257U mist be diluted with
238U to avoid classification as weapons=-grade, However, subsequent
reactor irradiation again produces plutonium which separates easily
by chemistry. Thus no fuel cycle can avoid producing weapons—grade
fuel, Of course one can minimize the proliferation hazard by using

extended LYR cycles and not reprocessing.

60
 

Both of the last two Presidential Administrations have suggested this
fall-back course, However, to get any significant improvement in
fuel utilization, reprocessing is necessary. Then one seeks to
minimize the transpori of weapons-grade and radioactive materials,
Molten-salt frel cycles with in-house reprocessing offer low pro-
liferation hazard comparable to that of the once~throush cycle,

2¢45¢3 Fuel Uftilization Restraints

Kno'm nuclear fuel supplies contain up to 1015Gw-years of
energye. However much of this industry cennot tap because ores are
uneconomic to extract and the current reactor fuel cycle uses less
than onz cie=thousandth of that which 1t does extraci, The absence
of any naturally-occuring "fissile' isotope puts Th at a further
disadvantage.

A reactor conceot which could zvproach full utilizafion of all
actinide fuel mizht stand a chance of providing the economics neces=-
sary to accomplish the extraction of low-grade ores, including both
uranium and thorium for fission reactors. Such a concept should ex-
hibit a high BG to overcome thoriumts fissile disadvantage,

2¢5e¢4 Strategic Securitiy Restraints

Dams and current nuclear power plants provide attractive targets
to internal and external attack, !MSRs offer a hardening fto such attack
by continuous removal of the major radiation hazard from the system and
ability 1o transfer the whole core further underground at a momenf%
notice. However, if an NHCFR provided the break through to universal

cheap electricity, that should be the greatest advance to security.
2.6 Promise and Uniqueness of the Molten Chloride Fast
Reactor on a Thorium Fuel Cycle

The promise and uniqueness of this concept stems from the
molten salt state, the exclusive use of thorium, continuous repro-—
cessing, and tne very fast neutron spectrum,

20641 Advantazes of the Molten State

Having the fuel in a2 fluid state allows out-of-core cooling,
thereby avoiding structural components in fields of significant ra-
diation damage. It also eliminates labor and material costs assoe
ciated with fuel element decladding, dissolution, and fabrication,
Fuel handling by vumps and piping should be less complex than solid
fuel handling. ©“he simplifi:d core should greatly ease the plant
design, and increase its reliability and availabiliiy, thereby de-
creasing cost,.

A fluid state system also facilitates on-siie close~coupled
fuel reprocessing (Section 2,6.2)s Out=of=core cooling of the
molten salt allows the primary circuit to operate at low pressure:
+this reduces the severity of the environment and allows materials
such as graphite for pipinge That should reduce fuel cycle cosis,

Elimination of fuel cladding and structural material signif=-
icantly improves the neutron economy of the reactor: more neutrous
are available for breeding, reduced critical mass, or other tradeoffs,

The molten state allows high power densities (up to 10 M
per liter) and high temperature operation while at low pressure:
fuel melting is part of the design and so is not a problem; fuel

vaporization does not occur until extreme temperatures, contributing

62
to low operating pressures, Only the contciner materials impose
temperature limitse, With o alloys 900°C appears to be an upper
limite Graphite structures should tolerate considerably higher
temperatures, This could significantly advance thermal efficiency
which could attendantly reduce therma]l pollution of the environment,
Hizh temperature operation affords applications with existing

steam technology, or with He secondary coolant for gas turbines

or process heat, High power density also promoies small sizes
which saves plant costs.

The eutectic nature of the hzlide salts facilitates low tem~
perature overation in the near term by minimizing chemically-reducing
corrosion oroblems with Mo-F2 alloys. With graphite, these problems
nay aot existe Later, high temperature pperation leading to higher
efficiency process heat =t compositions away from the eutectic nadir
can be implemented when more is kmown about material corrosion,
Off-eutectic compositions can also mean higher BG and thermal con-
ductivity of salt,

Halide salts also offer superior thermal and radiation stabil-
ity. This inhibits the formation of other compounds, thereby prevent-
ing corrosion,

The molten nature greatly benefits- safety as well: increase in
temperature causes a strong decrease in fuel density. The inherent
stability of this negative temperature coefficient will limit ex=
cursions, A self-regulating system may be possible, avoiding the
need for control elements,.

The fluid state of the fuel also enhances safety under abnor-

63
 

mal condition through a combination of properties:
(1) Pluidity facilitates removal from the reactor to ever-
safe containers
(2) High heat capacity of fuel restricts temperature rise
on loss of normal cocling
(3) Low salt vapor pressure mininizes the effect of any
temperature rise
2e6e2 Adventazes Stemming from the Ixclusive Use of Thorium
The nuclear industry has exclusively used the uranium fuel
cycle to date, mainly because no "fissile" thorium isotope erisis,
However, once a thorium cycle proves viable, numerous adventazes
accrue, Because the burning of thorium begins much lower on the
atomic weight scale than does uranium, little plutonium or higher
actinides accurmilate, The plutonium which does appear will be
mostly 238Pu, a strong heat source which melts in concentrated form

unless cooled, That hinders its use as a weapone

The predominant products in the cycle will be 232Th, 233Pa,

233U, 234U, and 235U. The only significant hazard associated with
these will be gamma radiation from 232U decay daughters, As the
I.CFR concept requires no handling (as in fuel element fabrication)
this will be a2 plus; it prohibitedly hazardizes the constructior of
Weapons,
2+643 Advantzges of On~site Continuous Reprocessing
Reprocessing on~site minimizes the fissile inventory, environ-

mental hazard, and proliferation danger of the whole system: fuel

is not tied up in other plaants or their temporary storage depois,

64
 

It is also not under transport to or from such locations, eliminc~
ting highjaciking, sabotage, and transporiation accidents, Finally,
it never even occurs in a form or container suitable for transport,
except for breeding gain export,

Continuous reprocessing minimizes the fuel inventory cutside
the reactor: +the iaventory in the core, piping, and heat exchangers
reoresents almost the entire fuel cycle inventory., Continuous re-
processing also removes hazardous and neutron absorbing fission prode
ucte while adding fresh shim fuel from the blanket, This greatly
reduces the potential radioleogiczl danger of the reactor while in~
creasing ihe neutron economy. Processing on-line allows on-=line
refueliing, That reduces domtime and obviates mechanical shim
devices,; increasing the neuiron economy,

24644 Advantages of a Very Fast Neutron Spectrum

An [ICFR exhibits a very fast neutron energy spectrum: chlorine
(atomic weight A%36) comnstitutes the lightest major element; the
salt contains only small amounts of Na (4=23) or K (A=39), Thus
no strong elastic scatferers pervade to moderate the neutron's energy.

Choosing 2 high molar content of UCl, in the core salt further

3
inhibits the neutron moderation. The principal moderating mechanism
then defaults to heavy element inelastic scatter, Feeding only
233UCl3 (~ no ThCl4) into the core reduces even that relative to
fission,

Table 241=II compared the median flux energy of the resulting

neutron spectrum to that for other fast reactors, Since the neutron

capture cross section decreases wiih energy and many isotopes ex=

65
 

hibit threshold behavior for fission (Figure 2,1-5), the hard spectrum
enhances fission over capture, The result is that
1. Reactivity per unii mass increases, decreasing the critical
size
2e More actinides now fission usefully rather than just trans-

mate into a higher-A actinide

o 233 232

3. Th U (n,2n) cross section for producing “~ U, 2 pro-
liferaiion detferrent, increases

4, Parasitic neuiron capture by fission products and structural
materials decreases, thereby improving the neutron economy,
and decreasing the sensitivity of those meterials

233

5« Boih Pz and 234U tend more to fissione This eliminates
the need to remove and hold 233Pa for decay into 233U.

In a plutonium=fueled MCFR, the high actinide density,.the
absence of core internals, and the very fast neutron spectrum can
combine to raise BG up to Oe7e A 233U/Th system could probably
only achieve BG of 042 10 045+ Should one prefer a BG near zero,
the good neutron economy can be diverted to other advantages such
as smaller blankets, slower fission product cleanup, added Th in
the core mix to reduce pover density, cooling in-core, or operation
a2t (lower) eutectic nadir operating temperatures,

The fast neutron spectrum also implies low fission cross sec-
tions relative to 2 thermal neutron spectrums To accomplish the
same pover density as in a thermal system, the flux levels must

16 -2 -1

exceed 10 necn sec o The lack of cvore intermals limits ra=

diation damage problems in the out=of-core cooled MCFR. On the plus

66
 

side, such flux levels might benefit MCFR variants such as high flux

[75] reactors for molecular studies and radio-medicine prouuction [76]

and flux-irap burner reactors for troublesome fission product trans-

mutation [23].

24645 Spinoff Ability fo Dizest Existing Spent Fuels

The MCFR should be able to usefully consume 2ll existing spent

fuels,

In principle one could bring in spent LWR oxide fuel, declad

it (radioactivity makes this the most cumbersome step), coavert it

to chloride just like 'h and U (natural or depleied) oxides, and

breed it in the blanket region. That would, of course, mean pro-

ducing Pu., One might not wznt to export that capability and mey

need to ensure that any expcrtable MCFR designed for the Th cycle

cannot be easily so modified,

3.0 CONCEPT DESIGN

MCFR(Th) neutronics will depend on the choice of reactor con-
figuration, method of cooling, power density, operating temperatures,
salt compositions, structural materials, and method of shim and
safety conirol.s Sectiorn 2 provides directives for choosing: use-
fully consume the actinides, use thorium as feed fuel, and maximize
breedinse These all coincide with a supra-guide~line: keep the
core neutron spectrum as hard as possible, An intrinsic guideline
is technical and economical feasibility,

by minimizing neutron moderation and leakage, Following subsections

However, beryllium is toxic, relatively scarce and quite light.
Graphite, in contrast, costs little.

Cu and Ni are well known for their ability to reflect fast
neutrons, Fe and Pb reflect almost as well and cost less. All
four qualify as inelastic or heavy=elastic acatters. However,
reflector studies in Section 3.5.6.3 indicate that with a
blanket thickness of 200 cm, the choice of reflector material
matters little. Then the low cost and low activation of graphite
should predominate..

Borrowing a page from fusion test reactor design, one could
reduce damsge to the vessel with an inper liner. Neutrons

striking it change direction and lose energy; they are then less

3.1.3 Core and Blanket Design

3.1.3.,1 Choice of geometry. Spherical geometry offers
1. Minimum neutron leakage in a critical reactor (thereby
maximum BG)
2. Minimum chielding and plant size
3., Minimum critical mass

L. Simule theoretical computation

The first two factors directly affect reactor design. Minimum
critical mass actually matters littie: the fuel utilization
issue pertains more to total cycle inventory while proliferation
deais with the availability of attractive weapons~grade or car-
cinogenic material., The fourth factor affects just the methods
used for survey calculations.

Three main designs come to mind in spherical gecmetry. The
first copies the thermal MSBR: . core and blanket materials, i.e.
fissile and fertile, flowing together homogenecusly. The second
copies the usual breeder reactor: a minimumesize core surrounded
by blanket. The third adds an inner blanket (Figure 3.1-2).

Inherent disadvantages with spherical containers may be

1. Difficult fabrication of structural materials

2. Difficult replacement of structurai materials

3. Stresses due to material curvature necessitating a

stronger, thicker core/blanket interface

L. Non=-uniform flow velocities in the core, possibly

creating additional stress.

17
 

Cylindrical geometry offers choices similar to Fig. 3.1=2:
BG in (c) of Figure 3.1-6 may be slightly higher than in (b)
when the core fuel is all fissile and no fertile; BG in (a) will
probably be lower due to spectrum degradation. Likewise, re-
placement of the annular core (c¢) by near—equivalent-area tubes
(d) may further increase BG. Either each tube approaches
criticality or they approach each other in distance close

enough to avoid spectrum degradation.

Figure 3.1-6 Alternate Cyllndrlcal Geometries (Top View)

Design (d) also suggests quick and cheap replacement, a
simple solution to the problems of radiation damage and corrosion
in the reactor. Structural tubes obviously produce no fission
products; if made of graphite, they also radiate no gammas. That
should facilitate their handiing and disposal. Graphite also
costs little., A design with straight tubes would limit re-

placement downtime. Design (d) is also easier to make and replace

than (e).

3.1.3.2 Choice of number, size, and spacing of tubes. Pro-
ceeding with the Figure 3.1=6 (d) concept, Figure 3.1-7 defines
some annular arrays of N tubes. The dotted-line c¢ircle passing

through the tube locates their centers. To minimize core spectrum

18
 

degradation the circle might be several mean free paths in diameter
so that most neutrons leaving the side don't reach ftubes on the
other side, Alternatively tubes might abut one a2nother so that most
neutrons leaving a tube either go permanently into the blanket or

directly into another core tube, To minimize structural material, N

should be small,

Figure 3.1=-7, Annular array of H-tubes

A questior certain to arise over core tubes is the interdeven~
dence of their neutronics ani kineticse. One prefers:ejither close or
near-zero coupling between them: intermediate loose-coupling could
lead to oscillatiions, not quickly damped. 3Behavior as independent
reactors (zero-coupling) would probably require multiple control
panels and operators, i.c. separate full-power cores sharing the sare
blanket, This option might warrant attention as the tubes would share
the same reprocessing plant and other facilities as well without
affecting each other's operation, Since the reactor physics of each
reactor would simply copy that of a conventional_core and blanket
reactor, this study will not ireat it separately. Close neutronic
coupling implies physical closeness as well (separated by less than
one mean free path) and individually far subcritical, Then, shui-

down of one tube channel would shutdown the whole plant,.

9
3.1.3.3 Location of tubes. To gain more insight into tube
location, consider again the arnular core geometry of Figure
3.1-6(c). Fixing the reactor radius, Figure 3.1-8 depicts
designs with inner blanket (IB) diameter ranging from no IB to

no cuter blanket.

 

Fig. 3.1-8 Designs with Varying IB Diameters

Pertinent metrics include breeding gain, medium flux energy in
each region, and critical mass. Section 3.56e1 shows that the
largest breeding gain occurs with no inner blanket. This would
corfespond.to placing the tubes adjacent to one another in the

reactor center.

3.1.3.4 Axial blanket and neutron leakage, Neutrons which leak
from the reactor cannot breed. They also require shielding.
Lengthening the core helps but an axial blanket stops axial
ieakage best. Figure 3.1-9 suggests some designs which accom—
plish that by'daﬁpening the chain reaction in the tubes near top
and bottom of the reactor vessel.

The overriding concern in choosing between these designs

should be eame of making and replacing the tubes: otherwise one
must design for corrosion and high neutron radiation exposure.
The two skewed tube designs should excel in this regard because
the tubes are straight. The chain reaction in these would con-
fine itself to prolate or oblute spherical gecmetries. The

critical geometry for the other three designs, wouid more
resemble a cylinder.

The next two designs exhibit large bends. Presumably, one-
would use straight pieces tc the extent possibie and fasten them
to the bends, a cumbersome orocsdure in a radiation environment.
The bailconed tube design presents even more difficulty to make
and replace. -

In conclusicn, the use of a few (N=3 or 4) large skewed tubes
should present the least engineering difficulty in their fab-

rication, operation, and replacement. It will also minimize

neutron spectrum degradation and neutron parasitic capture.

32
3.1.4 Method of Keactivity Shimming

The concentration ratio [233U]/[U + Th + FP] provides a
suitable though only approximate measure of the ratio of neutron
producers to neutron absorbers. As the reactor operatés,
this ratio naturally decreases in the core, thereby losing reac-
tivity. Replacement by a mix of higher ratio restores the
reactivity.

In Figure 3.1-10 the blanket breeds 233uc1h and the re—
processing plant separates it from ThClh and NaCl (Section 3.7).
Addition of 4, Na or Th reduces UClh to UC13:

r

-+

5+ UClL ——» HCLl + UCJ.3
Na + UClA —n  NaCl + UCl3
Th + 40014 —e ThCll+ + 4UCIL3

The separated 23311013 should immediately mix in a shim tank with
highlyeradicactive reprocessed core fuel (for non-proliferation
purposes). As shim mix flows into the core, irradiated fuel

passes out to the FP remover. If necessary, a ThClh/NaCl mixture

could be used to provide negative shim.

3ele5 Summary Guidelines on Reactor Configuration

The first priority is to maximize BG. Hardening the ccre
neutron spectrum enhances the BG potential but not necessarily
the achievable BG. Hard spectrum also increases the fission
probability for all the actinides,

Spherical geometry maximizes BG by minimizing neutron leak-
age but presents engineering difficuities. It also limits the
power density: since critical masses are smailer in spherical
geometry, power densities rise. Varying the core length in
cylindrical geometry provides more choice in the critical mass
and power density. The spectrum remains hard.

One can also use multiocle, small cylindrical tubes: some
spectrum softening occurs there, depending upon their proximity.
The optimum configuration may be a small number (e.g. three) of
skewed tubes penetrating a cylindrical tank. The effective
geometry of the neutron distribution will then closely approach

a sphere.

84
 

3«2 Reactor Thermohydraulics
An MCFR will require only low pressures for circulation and repro-
cessing removal., Much of the MSBR technology in thermohydraulics should

apply as well to the MCFR.

3.2.1 Means cf Ccooiing the Molten Salt Fuel

e consider three means of cooling moiten salt fuel (Pig-

ure 3.2-1): cui-of-ccre neat exchange, ih--cCre heat exchange acress

tubes, and in=-ccrae direct ccatact with a secandary coclant.

3.2.1.1 Out—cf-core heat exchenge., Here the molten fuel flcws
cut cf the core through piring to the external heat exchanger,
great.y ircreasing the sysi:m inventory. As 3 resuii, mcst de-
layed neutrons emanate outs.de the core. This affects reacter
control (section 3.6.2.2), and the neutromns act.ivate- the primary
circuit and its envirens. The large fuel inventory might pena-
lize the economics of a =2 —or Pu-based piant; for an MCFR(Th)
the penalty matters less because thorium abounds more, the feed
requires no enrichment cr fabrication, and the plant achieves
near-fuil actinide utiliza.ticn. Large fuel inventory also works
against non-proliferation goals, but not as seriously as if it
occurred out=of-plant in transport, reprocessing, or fuel fab-
rication operations.

The absence of structural material inside the reactor maximizes
the neutron economy and minimizes softening the neutron spectrum. The
high emphasis an these characteristics in Section 2 prompts us to adopt

this method of cooling for this study.

Nelsan et al [21] examined two MCFR(Pu) designs with out~
of-core cooling: his main comment was an economical concern for
the large Pu inventory. Lane [ 78] mentioned out-of=core cool~
ing for a high~flux (1016 n sec T cm-z) materials~testing fast
reactor. Winfrith examined at least four out~of-core cooling
variants, They recommended further study with both He and lead
secondary coclants.

carlier Taube studies [19] concentratad on in-core conling.
Taube cautioned that loss of delayed neutrans out-of-core might
hurt reactor control. Later work emphasized out—of-core cool-
ing to achieve high flux in owrner and test reactors and high
3G in power reactorse.

analyzed a 2030 MWth MCFR(U/Pu) ccoled by

stirred the fuel in the vessel to a speed of 2m/sec to increase
the heat transfcr. That much Mo meant large neutron absorption
(3.3% of the core total). The core inlet and outlet temperatures
were 750 and 793°C. A main question was the weldability of
the Mo-alloy tubes.

A Winfrith group examined [29] Taube's work.. They found
his breeding gains slightly high due to expected deficiencies
in the Bondarenko cross sections for 23 8U and Pu. Also they
found the physical properties of the salt not to be as good
as what he used. These differences would increase tii€ maxdimum

fuel salt temperature to 1160°C. There one approaches limits of

suggested tubes of steel-reinforced graphite.

limited themselves to an 80000 salt tenperatures Within that re-
striction they found poor performance, especially low BG due to
neutron absorption by heat exchange materials,

£1uid like molien lead [29], boiling mercury [20], or boiling AlCl,

out and passes out of the core to a heat exchanger. iThe direct con-
tact of molten fuel with molfen coolant affords very good heat trans-
fer, elimination of coolant tubes (and cladding), and possibile ex-
traction of fission products.

The principal problems occur with mixing and separating the
fuel and coolant, and corrosion. The need for extensive research
to overcome these led to the abandonment of this method of cooling,

Constant bleedoff of the blanket salt (for reprocessing) and re=-
placement by cold HaCl/ThCl4 may satisfy the heat removal require-

ments,.

3,2.2 Power Density in an MSFR

3.2.2.1 Inherently high power density in MSFRs. The absence of struc—
tural materials allows high fissile fuel atom density. Absence of nau-
tron moderating materials, and limited presence of fertile and carrier
salts keeps the spectrum hard. Together, these results produce high v
(=96;/ G ) and small critical dimensions. To then produce the

same power as a thermal reactor requires high power densities.

3.2.2.2 Reallstic range of power densities. No actual experience
with 1SFRs exists. ORNL considered power densities of 5~10 Md/
liter in a study of an MSFR fast flux test facility. Taube's MCFR
(Pu) designs range from 0.2 to 11.1 MW/). British designs had 0.36
Mi/l.
CRNL operated a thermal molten salt reactor up to 80 kﬂ/ 1.
Peak power densities in existing water-cooled reactors include 1.3, 1.5,
2.5, and 4.4 Mi/1 in m, HFBR, ATR, and HFIR [78], respectively.
A coolant velocity of 120 ft/s might perﬁt 10 MW per liter of core in
HFIR [’(8]. For the sodium—cooled fast reactors Melekes Cll-2, Phoenix
250, and FFTF, core power densities average 2.5, 0.46, and 1.0 Md/1.
The power per unit volume ccolant for the sodium- and water-cooled
reactors above is a factor of two higher., Thus a peak power density of
10 Mi7/1 for a fast molten salt reactor does not appear infeasible, but
this st.udy‘should not exceed it without good cause and a lower
one would present less engineering difficulty.
Flow velocity and heat exchanger size (i.e. cut—of-core fuel

inventory) may constitute the real operational limits.

density. N fissile I° also higher here, but that leads to small critical
volume and higher power density (Section 3.2.2.1) which makes @ even

higher. Because of high @ (> 1016 n em 2

sec™?), ancther limit to power
density could be radiation damage to structural materials (at thehlan.
ket core interface).

The number of displacements per atom and the helium production rate
gauge radiation damage far intermediate and heavy mass materials. In
the past 0.1 MeV and > 1.C MeV fluence served as somewhat coarser (but
still valid) éa.ﬁges. This emphasiies ~_tha:t' most 211 6f the neutmné in a

Cut near the reactor perimeter the 2-meter molten salt blanket has

greatly reduced the flux in the pressure vessel down to ~ 101:3 n cm-2

g0
: this gives a 30 year fluence of ~v1022 n cm-2 for which much

5 -1
experience already exists, Keeping the vessel exposure low is ime
portant enough to discourage the use of any regular arrays of solid
materizl in the blanket through which neutrons could stream,

3e2e2¢4 Impetus for high temperature operation. Heat transfers from

the core according to

q=m C, AT, (3.2=2)
Here
g = the heat removal rate = the heat generation rate under equi=-
librium conditions
m = the mass flow rate, proportional to the fluid velocity (v),
density, and the flow area
C = the heat capacity of the fluid (energy per unit mass per unit
temperature)
J&Tf = the temperature increase of the fluid from entrance to exit

of the core,

Cp and the density are relatively fixed; only v, the flow area,
and ATf can varye. Raising v would increase pumping power requirements
and corrosione. Increasing the flow area may dictate more ThCl4 or
NaCl to avoid supercriticality: that, in turn would soften the spectrum
and reduce the BG potential,

With regard to increasing Amf, Section 3,3 already requires inlet

temperatures of 55000 and higher, Thus an MSFR inherenily generates

91
high temperature heat. This offers advantages (touted elsewhere) as
well as problems. The problems may include leakage through seal expan-
sion and melting of metal. Also, in numerdus fused-salt systems, high
temperature gradients at equilibrium enhance chemical corrosion [80].
Thus, in short summary, increased heat removal requirements will

mest  likely increase corrosicn and/er soften the spectrum.

3,2.2.5 Adjusting power density through critical mass. Sectian 3.5
sets the minimum critical voiume for an MCFR(Th) at about 60 liters of
0.06 ™. Fer a 10 Gith reactor this would imply a power density of
167 Miyth/l. Even for a 2250 !Wth reactor (1000 Mde) it spells 38 Mdth/l.
The power density limits of szction 3.2.2.2 (10 i&/1) dictate a larger
critical volume.

Cne way to get it is to increase leakage from the core (but not from
the reactor) by reducing the core dimensicn in one or more directions. A
thin cylinder is one logical solution: above a given length-to=diameter
ratio the length can infinitely increase without appreciably changing
keff‘ However, space requirements and return piping do impose practical
limits on the length.

Multiple thin cylinders resolve that dilemma. In regular array
(Figure 3.1-7) they approach an annular core geametry with internal blanket
(IB). As the IB diameter increases (annulus moves radially outward in

Fig. 3.1=-8) the critical volume further increases.

92
 

In the skewed tube configuration the effective geometry (where
the tubes come together) can vary from one of minimal core leakage
when angles between tubes are equal and near perpendicular, to one of
high leakage when ftubes penetrate the vessel top and bottom or from
the vessel sides (Figs 3e1=9),

A second way to increase the critical veolume would be to increase
neutron absorption by allowing a higher equilibrium concentration of
fission products., However, breeding zzin would suffer,

A third way is to increase the carrier salt concentiration (de-
crease the molar percentage of actinide salt), However, this will
sofien the neuiron spectrum and decrease the BG potential, (This
would not decrease the BG proliferation hazard of the material: any
material which can sustain a chain reaction in a fast reactor, can do
so even easier in a bomb configuration,)

A fourih method is to add in fertile materizl, This will soften
the spectrum somewhat but without parasitic capture of neutrons, In-
deed, this option looks very favorable; section 3,3 discusses it

further.

93
3.2.2.6 Reactor design power. For a given power density, adding more
fuel (e.g. lengthening the core) can increase the total reactor power.
This should increase the economics since the capital equipment, includ-
ing that for reprocessing, changes mare slowly. However, two or more
snall reactors at a plant nay excel over ane larger ane: though each
cne requires separate instrumentation and operating crew, while one is
down the other still uses the reprocessing system and produces eleciric
power. Without significantly coupling the cores, the blankets of
sevaral reactors might also abut one another so as to eliminate re-
flector and enhance breeding.

A popuiar size for intercomparisan of designs is 1000 ifve.

3.2.2.7 HReactor vower distribution. Zonewise, fission of bred 233U
should generate more power in the blanket than high-threshold 232Th
fission would. The usual concerns regarding power peaking vanish: the

fuel is already melted, and burnup is homogenous due to liquid mixing.

- 3.2.2.8 Summary. The 2-meter thick blanket protects the vessel from
the high fluxes accompanying high power density. The frequency of
skewed core tubes replacement will still depend on the flux levels, In-
creasing the core volume therefore increases the tube lifetime, The most

constructive way to do that will be

(1) The use of multiple thin skewed tubes

(2) Dilution of the fuel with fertile salt

94
 

3,2.,3 Primary Coolant Velocity

Section 3.2.2.4 pointed out that v, flow area, and AT; are the

only variables for removing heat from the core.

3.2.3.1 Maximizing velocity and minimizing pumping power,  ToO maX-
imize velocity ane desires as few bends as possible. Flow through a
sphere like Fig. 3.2-2, unless baffled samehow, would proceed more

slowly near the surface than through the middle. This could lead to
surface hot spots as well us neck corrosian. The ideal ge-metry for

maximum v would seem to be large-diameter pipes as described in section

Jelele

Fig. 3. 2"'2

Typical Spherical Reactor

 

For canstant mass flow rate the coolant velocity, v , will vary in=-
versely as the tube cross sectional area. Pumping power increases as v3;
for v {15 m/s, pumping uses 5 = 8% of the power. Friction losses in

small pipes will add to this. This recommends a few large pipes for

 

maximum flow velocitye.

95
 

3.203.2 Corrosion dependence on velocity. How velocity affects cor-
rosion depends upon the corrosion mechanism which, in turn, depends on
the metal and its environment [80], For corrosion by activation polare
ization (Curve B, Fig. l.2-2), velocity has no effect,

Corrosion by cathodic diffusion does increase with velocity as in
Curve A/Section te Small amounts of an oxidizer, e.g. dissolved oxygen
in acids or water, czause this, Easily passivated materizls such as
stainless steel and titanium frequently resist this corrosion better af
high velocity: there the increased agitation causes an active-tow
passive transition (curve A&, sections 1 and 2).

Some metals resist corrcsion in certain mediums by forming massive
protective films on their surfaces, These differ.from the usual pas~
sivating films in that they are readily visible and Such'less tenacious,
Extremely-high velociiies may mechanically damage or remove these films,
resulting in accelerated attack (curve C)s This is called erosion cor-

rosion,

3e24,3e3 Velocities in similar systems, In an LMFBR core sodium
typically flows at 8 m/se In the HFIR core, the coolant reaches
120 £t/s (37 m/s).

In theoretical studies, Taube [17,79] considered velocities of
10416 m/s in the heat exchanger, choosing 14 m/s as optimume. The
British [29] varied v from 4~11 m/s in their NCFR heat exchanger. ORNL
designed an MCFR heat exchanger with a fuel salt velocity of 6.1 m/s,.

3e244 Overating Temperatures

Numerous criteria will limit the primary circuit temperature,
Figure 3,2=4 illustrates the discussion.

3.24441 Upper limits on fusl salt tcmperature, A high fuel sali
temperature could increase the feasible AT and thereby provide extra
hezt transfer driving force, This would then reduce the needed inter-
mediate heat exchanger area, and therzto the external fuel inventory.
Temperatures above 900°C allow operation with He as the secondary
coolant. Even higher temperature would allow MHD topping cycles and
increased efficiency irn conventional heat exchangers,

However, the temperature musn't exceed the salt boiling point or
cause damage to the piping materizl in or out of the core, Temperature
increases the rate of almost all chemical reactions, Corrosion fre-
"quently accelerates exponentially with temperature once past some
threshold value, Refractory metals such as Ho and Mo alloys have high
melting point and {thermal conductivity and resist corrosion well,

With graphite piping, the fuel salt temperature limit might extend to

The British [29] considered 970°C with He cooling and 810 with Pb
cooling. Taube studied 860-1100"C and chose 950°C, ANL [21] stayed
with 740°C. The French considered 1000-1300°C for high temperature
applications but warned of problems to be overcome,
3,2.4.2 Minimum fuel salt {temperature, The minimum inlet temperature
must exceed the salt melting point with an adegquate safety margin.
Although melting points of actinide chlorides decrease with transmute-
ion up the A-scale (Section 3.6.2.3), impurities also build in which
might raise the melting point through the formation of complex com=
pounds,

Table 3,3-VI suggests 2 minimum T of 65000 to allow some

fuel
range in composition; addins a BOOC margin glives TOOOC. For comparable
MCFR(Pu) concepts, the British chose 650-670°C; Taube used 750°C;

ANL, 625°C; OZNL, 566°C.

3e2.4.3 Hinimum secondary coolant temperatures. Secondary coolant
salts with 2 variety of melting points are available, at least in
principle (Section 3¢10.1e1). In practice other problems and

properties may limit the choice. For process heat applications, the

secondary cocolant temperature must be fairly high,

allow for abnormal transient conditions which produce

3e2e4e5 Restrictions on ftemverature differences within the primary
circuit, The maximum Zle within the primary circuit will be the
difference between core inlet and outlet temperatures, A similar [&Tf
occurs betfween heat exchanger inlet and outlet, NS3R experience in-
dicates that when

(1) The reaction between the fuel salt and a structural alloy

constituent stronzgly depends on temperature, and

(2) Temperature differs greatly within the circuit,
then the constituent dissolves at the high temperature regicns and
deposits in colder regions,

The scope of this study Joes not permit quantification of this re-
striction; however, the poteztial mass transfer does discourage going
far beyond the circuit AT, in similar reactor designé’(below).
3e2e4e6 [ AT, T] in other MCFRs, Figure 3.2-5 summarizes the resulis
of previous MCFR(Pu) designs, Taube's [17] and the British He-cooled
designs [29] are perhaps the boldest in using higher T's and AT's,
Many desisms use a lower melting salt (with lower actinide molar con-
tent) to operate the fuel salt below 70000.
3elelte] Summary, Based on the above discussion, this study considers

(1) A minimum fuel salt temperature of 700°C

(2) A referemce AT, = 200°C; advanced, 300°C

(3) A reference Amiéx = 200°¢; advanced, 3OOOC

(4) A reference LMTD = 150°C; advanced, 200°C
The advanced AT's exceed those of earlier studies (except Taube's)

and are to be avoided if possible.

3.2,6 Primary Circuit Arrangement
3.24641 General Guidelines, Sections 2.5.4, 3.6, and 3.7 and 3,9
show the need for transferring the core and blanket fluids to remote
storage tanks, and flushing the primary circuit. Sections 3,6,2 and
3.8 emphasize minimizing the fuel salt inventory. Section 2,5.,5
mentions the importance of reliability and plant factor.
3424542 Location of pumps and heat exchancers., Both pumps and heat
exchangers should closely surround the reactor as in Figure 1.,2-2 so
as to minimize the fuel inventory in pipinge Shielding from core
neutrons, beyond that provided by the blanket, is rot warranted as the
primary coolant itself emits delayed reutrons, Placing the pump between
the heat exchanger and the ccre inlet imposes a lower overating tempera-
ture on it; this should lengthen its service and easeiits designe
3e2e643 Parallel subchannels, As each tube channel (of N total) leaves
the core it could split into M>2 subchannels, each with a small pump
and/or heat-exchanger., Such redundancy should increase load factor
and safety of operation, Small size would also make it easier and
cheaper to build and replace the units, and easier to avoid criticality
outside the core. However, as the number of pumps increases, the chance
for a single pump failure does also, Thus the optimum plant load factor

could occur for a smaller number of pumps and/or heat exchangers.

113
 

Several alternate arrangements are possible (Figure 3,2-8), Plan
A schedules a single pump and heat exchanger for each channel, Plan 3
splits the flow outside the core into M>2 parallel paths, each with a
punp and heat exchanger. Plans C and D only duplicate pumps., Thus in
3; Cy or D, 2 single pump failure does not terminate all flow,

Approaches A, B, and C differ significantily from the multiple cool=-
ing loop concept of current reactor designs: the principal N loops have
no common container as in Plan D: each circulates independently. Plan
D probably is infeasible because of the

(1) Desire to compactize space so as to keep down the fuel in-

ventory (minimum piping per heat exchanger)

(2) Difficulty in avoiding a critical configuration

if a single pump fails with plan A, not only must that channel
flow cease, but the others' must also: +the whole reactor must shut
down less the chain reaction continue to generate heat in the broken
channel as well as in the two good ones, 1In plan 3B or C, failure of
one pump again affects the whole reactsr: +the flow and power reduce
by 1/M in the bad channel and the other N-1 core channels must also
due to the close neutronic coupling,

If M=2 subchannels in plan C represent regular and backup paths,
then each can handle the full flow and one is always ready in backup -
just need to switch a valve, PFigure 3.,2-9 shows a top view of such 2
plan, Use of multiple (M22) subchannels especially for pumps, should
increase reliability and ability for reduced power operation, but may
also increase fuel inventory;auxiliary heating, and friction (due to

added bends).

3.,2.644 Tube channels in series, ror a skewed core (recommended in
section 3.143¢4) the inlet and outlet of a tube occur on opposite
sides of the reactor. To avoid excessive piping and fuel inventory
the outlet of one tube shouid connect to the inlet of another, which
lies vertically belows This means connecting all N channels in series,
Fige 3¢2=10 attempts to describe this. It's as if someone ran a
needle and thread through a cylindrical cushion; coming out the top,
the thread returns outside the cushion to another entrance point on
the bottoms, This continues until the thread reiurns to the starting
position.

The series conneciion causes failure of one pump or aeat exchanger
to shut down the whole system. But this does not differ from plan 4,
and one can still employ duplicate subchannels as in.% or C above,

Figure 3.,2-11 shows a B-type horizontal M=2 design. Here the
tubes peneirate sides rather than the top and bottomes This should
simplify the reactor support and reduce the out-ofwcore inventory as
well, A physical model would be three pencils lying across each other,
penetrating an approximately-square cylinder of (blanket) jello.
3.2.6.§ Summary. In the reference concevi a small number of skewed
tubes connect in series, Alternate subcharnels with pumps in each
could provide backup, but would add frictvion losses, On-~line backup
(to avoid reactor shutdown) would also increase inveniory and auxil-
iary heating. Keeping N to 3 or 4 should help the system reliability
as well as reduce the time required for repair and maintenance. It

also minimizes neutron spectrum degradation and parasitic absorpticn.

3.3 Choosing the Salt Composition

The abundance and low neutrcn moderation of chlorine maké
sodium and actinide chlorides the preferred molten salts for fast
reactors on the U/Pu cycle (Section 1.2). Here we ccncentrate on

the thorium fuel cyéle which could have different priorities.

3.3.1 Intrcducticn

 

The top cancerns in chéosing the sélt ccmpositian are neutran-
ics (especially neutron spectrum), chemistry, and meiting point.
Cther desirabie tréiﬁs are

1. Good heat transfer properties: high thermal canductivity

and specific heat cazacity

2. High boiling point to minimize vapar pressure

3. Adequate technological cr laboratory experier;ce

L. Low fuel salt viscosity to minimize pumping ccsts

5. Low price and good availability

6., Non—toxic

J::.1.1 Neutron spectrum. We desire as hard a neutron spectrum in
the core as possible, though not at the expense of BG. Siﬁce non-—
fissile constituents mainly downscatter and capture neutrans, this
means maximizing the ratic of 233U to all other isotopes. |
In the blanket, a softer neutron spectrum enhances neutron cap-
ture by the fertile material. Thus neutrcn moderators might help
‘there, if they don't absorb neutrcns as well. However this would

not be good for an inner blanket as it would then soften the ccre

neutrcn spectrum.

120
If the core tubes were many mean free paths apart, then each
tube would individually approach delayed critical and have a hard

spectrum, but their ccupling would be loose or near-zero.

3.3.1.2 Chemistry. Using the molten salt fuel as the primary cool=
ant of a nuclear reacter presents many novel problems in both reactor
design and system chemistry. The success of the CRNL Molten 3alt
Reactor Program shows that it can be done at least up to their pow-
er levels. Experience there also revealed that the chemical states
often behave as if in equilibrium. This allows much progress tcowards
understanding interactions within the salt (chemical stability) and
between the salt and its envircnment (corrosion) since many of the
equilibria are grossly predictable.

The free energy of formation of the compounds, AgG, measures
the chemical stability of the salts, specifically their ability to
resist forming other compounds which precipitate out. Taube has
deduced the temperature-dependent A G for salts of interest (Fig-
ure 3.3-1;[82].

Candidate reactants in the system which threaten salt stability

l. Atmosphere constituents oxygen, water, and carban diaxide
2. Structural materials (Sectiom 3.4)
3. Fissian products and other mutants
Radiolysis also affects salt stability.
Chemical corrosicn involves several sciences (Fig. 3.3-2).

Electrochemistry describes electrode kinetics: the dissolution and

plating cut of different materials in electrical contact.

3.3.1.3 éutecticrmeltingApoint. Figure 3.3-=3 depicts a typical
eutectic behavior: the mixing of two salts lowers the melting
point far below that for either salt by itself. The amount of low=
ering depends on the molar ratio of the two salts; excepticnally low
temperature is possible at the eutectic point, or nadir. This may
be of special value for the blanket region where litile heat 1is
generated.

A fuel mix with melting point well below 700°C would minimize
auxiliary heating when shut down and allow a large temperature rise
in the core without reaching high outlet temperatures (> 1000°¢).

Low melting points of the component salts also will facilitate their

initial dissolutione.

As cother factors disccurage the use of fluorides in the core, this
section studies oniy chliorides. Infermation an density ( fD ) is read-
ily available for pure salts and a satisfactory algorithm exists far

mixtures. Viscosity (/}1 ) and specific heat (Cp) data also suffice.

Thermal conductivities are very sparse.

UClh and alkaii chlorides. They found the density of individual salts

to decrease linearly with temperature, getting

fair agreement for NaCl and KC1, getting /o = 1.596 and 1.552 by

For a mixture of salts Desyatnik showed [83]} that linear addition

of the molar (specific) volumes of each salt

P = LI wifp ]

gives densities high compared io experiment. Direct addition of
densities would give even higher errors, in the same direction. In
binary mixtures with carrier salts like NaCl, the maximum deviation
occurs a2t about 60 mole % actinide salt. A spot check on a 50=50
UclL 4/1:5.01 mixture at 1000K predicted /c (50/50, 1000K) = 2,91 whereas
the measured was 2.871+4¢ 0.,0024, Formation of complex salts, e.g,

3 KC1 + UClB-—-b-K3UC15, causes this deviation from linearity.
3.3,1.6 Viscosities, Section 3.2.5 showed that low viscosity in-
creases heat transfer. Fizurs 3.3=5 displays the temperature-dependent
viscosity for individual salis [85,86] beginning at their melting
points,

The viscosity of salt mixtures is gemerally unavailable; Figure
3,3-6 does show viscosity behavior for two salt mixtures: first Mg012
with NaCl [87]; then with ThCl, [88]s (Note that the two sets of pure
Mg012 measurements do not agree. The (latter) Russian work is partic-
ularly suspect because of other errors found there, Still the data are
informative here,) The bumps correspond to formation of complex
moclecules,

Comparison of these diagrams with phase diagrams Figs. 3.3-7 and
3.3-28 suggests a correlation with eutectic effects which, in turm,
depend on complex molecule formation. In general it appears feasible
to choose a2 molar composition where the viscosity is close to the low-
est individual salt viscosity. Therefore, for ThCl4/Nacl, UClB/NaCl,

UCl4/NaCl or combinations thereof we can roughly presume

The usefulness of this formula depends upon the confidence develooped
in it; Cambill had no data with which to test it. Attemots to fit
the availapble (Russian) data for individual szlis fail drematically,
Inspection of the terms reveals the cause: k. . (first term) ore-
dominantly depends on/oi/2 which has a negative T-coefficieat while
experimentally dk/dT is posiiives For K: onic (second term) the YT
factor overrides the negaetive T-devendence in/o, but only up to a
certzin iemperaiure. Overall this approach falls.

Perry's Chemical Ingineering Handbook [96] describes numerous
other formulae but these generally pertain Yo organics and other non-
related fluids; also they either do not freat temperature dependence
or they grossly disagree.

The few measurements of chloride mixtures available — RbCL/UCL A
and CsC1/UC1 g mixtures (Fige 3¢3=12 and 343-13) [94] — show that k
fluctuates dramatically with molar composition., The oscillations may
correspond to the formation of complex molecules just as occurred with
viscosity data, This behavior suggests that one might yet achieve high
k =k(pure carrier salt), even for high actinide molar composition and
vhen k¥ (pure actinide salt) is much lower.

Figure Je3=14 compares Gambill's predictions f{o the above date,
with and without the single~sali correction factors from Fige 3¢3-11,
In nost cases omission of the correction factor gives better agreement.

llote here how k very definifely increases with temperature: the
slope remains positive up through at least 60 mole % actinide salt, The
average velue of (dk/dT) /MeV from these six cases iSs 245 x 1070 W/m'K2
(or 640 x 10"9 cal/sec cm K2) in close agreement with the value of 2,3

-6

z 10 W m-K2 for UCl4

In summary, Gambill's formule for k(TmU) proved successful with

fluoride mixtures. With chloride salis it appears to succeed better
with salt mixtures than with the individual salts, Certain mixture
compesiiions should give a k comparable to that of the individual
carrier sali. For the mixtures of concern here, the covalent actinide
chloride tends to control the temperature depemdence of k: it wvaries
much less than the carrier chloride salt, To obtain high thermal con-
ductivity, both experiment (Figs 343-9) and theory (Gambill's formula
for high thermal conductivity) tend to favor salts with low M. In

Gambill's formula the factors Tmp and fgmp tend to cancel one another,

3.3.1.9 Summary, ‘e seek maximum 233U content and hard spectrum in
the fuel salt ard a softer spectrum in the outer blanket.

The CRNL MSR program shows that fuel salt circulation is feasible:
It ié facilitated in part by lowering of melting points in |
eutectic muilti-component mixtures. Chemical stability and
corrosion of the molten salts are fairly predictable.

Heat transfer depends on fuel sait density (/:) thermal
conductivity (k), viscosity Q/()- and specific heat (Cp).
Ip(T),/pL(T), and Cp (Tm.p.) are well known for single salts;
much less so for salt mixtures. Knowledge bf k (T for mizture is
better, but still skimpy. HMcjor uncertainties in predicting h. for 2

nixzture should stem from all bui/g(T).

fact that ~ 'ClL has the low level density of a magic nucleus (=20

5r and I also show (Figure 3.3-16) systematically lower melting

points, but availability and physiochemical properties may limit them.

Section 3.3~1 menticned how eutectic termary ﬁixtures can lowver
the melting point even further. However secticn 3.3.4 shows that

significant lowering only comes with low actinide molar content.

3.3.2.5 Boiling point and vapor pressure. Figure 3.3-70 shows how
the vapor pressure for metal chlorides depends on temperature; boil-
ing occurs where the vapor pressure reaches ane atmosphere. Core
salts with high boiling points will emit low vapor pressure at the
reactor operating temperatures. Tbis means low system pressure and
enhanced safety. Depending cn corrosicn rates, it may also permit
the use of thin-walled (more efficient) heat—exchanger tubes. The
higher the boiling point, the greater the uliimate temperatures
which may be employed, Boiling points above 1500-1600°C would
allow maximum high temperature operation with graphite, Thus one
desires a carrier salt with low melting voint and hizh boilineg ovoint,
Since the eutectic behavior applies only to the melting noints
these zoals are not as contradictory as they first seem.

Comparing the boiling points of chlorides and fluorides,
(Fige 3¢3-21) one concludes that generally the fluorides are less
volatile, especially for alkaline earths, Unfortunately the higher
melting points and moderating properties of the fluorides discourage
their use in the core., Should vapor pressure at desired itemperatures

become 2 dominating problem, they could provide relief,

3.3.2.6 Chemical behavior. This section surveys the chemical
stability of the halides in the system (tendency to break up) and
their corrosiveness (tendency to chemically attack the structural

materials in the primary circuit at the temperature of concern),

Figures 3.3-22 compares the stability of some chlofide and fluo-—
ride compcunds: the lower the A G, the more stable. NaCl end iir
ere particuiariy good. In general chlorides are less stable than
fluofides. This pattern of decreasing stability with nalide atomic
number continues through bromine and iodine.

The smell AC values for MoCl, and MoCly inhibit their fermatien,
wiiicn is why Ho is a preferrei siructural materiat in a chloride
system. Graphite also resists chemical attack (fcrma%ion of CF, and
ocL,) well. The appreciable AC for halides of Fe, Cr, and Ni makes
them unsuitable as structural material in contact with salt.

Chlorides generally dissalve in H,05 fluorides do not. Inside
the molten salt circuit the presence of oxygen or water will produce
oxy—chlorides (CCl) which corrode. Cutside the reactor, water sclu-
bility may facilitate cleanup of leaks or spills.

AG for other halides is less available; they are generally less

obvious cost and availability advantages for chlorine over Zluworine,
The scarcity and cost of Be for a F/Li/Be mix (necessary to achieve

low F melting temperatures) tilts the scale even more in favor of Cl.

necessary. I excels only in lower vapor pressure, Iﬁ the blanket,

157
3.3.3 Choice of Actinide Chemical States{Stoichiometry)
This section assumes the use of Cl salts in the core, and Cl or

F salts in the blatket.

3,3.3.1 Actinides inherent to an MCFR(Th). Since only thorium crosses
the plant boundary as feed replacement material, the principal actin-
ides in the system will be Th and U isctopes with Ae232-234. Pa, Np,
and Pu should total less than 1% (section 3.5.8.1). Pu starter fuel
in early reactors will produce some im and Cm but {hese fission use-

fully. Later reactors'wiil,Stdrt up on bred 233U.

3.3.3.2 Melting and boiling points. In Figure 3.3-16 the meltirnz
points for actinides in the -4 (IV) state clearly lie belcw those in
the (ITI) state. Eutectic mixtures tend to follow this frend. This
recommends the (IV) state for the blanket which geneéates less heat
and tolerates moderater much better (Sec. 3.3.1.1).

Few salt boiling points have been measured. As ITII-state melting
points exceed those of the IV state, boiling points should also. This

recommends the (III) state for the core salt.

3.3.3.3 Chemical benavior. UClA and UCl3 can coexist in equilibrium.
In the core some UC_L3 wirl picl up free chlarine to form UClh. By
itselfl UClh corrodes, but not when UCl3 predominates (i.e. when the
stoichiometry is near 3 Cl atoms to 1 U atom). ThClh may be present
in the core as a critical mass diluent or negative shimming agent, or
simpiy be carried over in blanket reprocessing. It can also coexist
with UCl3 without any deleterious effect.

Corrosion also increases with temperature. Temperature in the

blanket should be fairly low unless other conditions warrant a high

158
melting temperature.

3.3.3.4 Choice between UC.‘L3 and UCl‘E+ in the core. Hard spectrum,
BG potential, and corrosion should mainiy dictate the core com-
position. The higher uranium density and beiling point and

lower corrosiveness of UCl3 far outweigh the lower melting point

of UClh.

3.3.3.5 Chemical states in the blanket. As a chloride, Th exists
only as ThClh and can coexist with UCl, or UCl,. UCL, helps lower

3 L 4
the melting point in the blanket where little heat is generated.

159
3.3.L Choice of Carrier Salt Cation

Elements which promise chemical stability and high boiling point
(Fig. 3.3-21) as a halide carrier salt include the alkalis Li, Na and
K, and the alkaline earths Be, Mg, and Ca. Inadequate data limit the
studies of the heavier alkalies and alkaline earths Rb, Cs, Sr, and

Ba. Pb is included because of interest generated by British studies.

3.3.4.1 Neutron moderating effect. The average lethargy increment
per collisionfE measures the effectiveness cf various materials as
moderators. At most neutron energies %dapproximates the group—-
\ise elastic downscatter cross sectiem ( qdis the elastic scatter
crcss secticn and YU is the group lethargy width). The evidence
from § (Figure 3.3-23) and 557 /6w (Table 3.3-VII) pretsy uck
agree: L1 and Be moderzte very strongly; Na and Mg, intermediate; K

and Ca downscatter the least; Rb, Cs, Sr, Ba, and Pb should also.

courages cheoosing a carrier salt caticn (CSC) with A236: e.z. X or

ically-aggressive AlCl3 as well as a small change in valeacy. Trans—
mutaticn of K produces long-lived radioactivity and divalent calcium.
The magic proton number of Ca causes the existence of numerous stable
and quasistable Ca isotopes. These mostly transmute into themselves,
yielding nil radioactivity.

Rb produces long~lived SSKr and 9OSr plus considerable short-lived
radicactivity and different elements (especially Sr). Sr irradiation

90

principally leads to * Sr.

Cs tramsmutaticn products appear innocucus. Ba will directly
produce 13705. Protm-magic b will generally produce stable nuclei
but highly-exothermic (n, ) reactions will yield chemically different

Tl and Hg.

3.3.5.4 Melting point. This section relies on the limifed avazilable
fusibility diagrams for salt mixtures [87, 100-322]. Most of these
come from terse articles in remote Russian journals; some disagree with
one another, This limits us to only qualitative conclusions.

Low core salt melfing-point helps avoid high ocutlet temperature
(e.ge > 1000 C). Figure 3.3-25 displays the approximate melting points
for UCl3 mixes. Alkali chlorides tend to form lower temperature eutec-
tics with UCl3 than do alkaline earth chlorides., The bumps signal com-
plex molecules like K3U016 (3KC1'U013). Desyatnik et al [100] verify
that complex uranium groupings increase in frequency as the alkali-

cation radius increases,

l3 Salt Mixtures
Many of the eutectic melting points occur at lowUCl3 molar content.

In Contrast; hard spectrum and high BG potential favor high actinide

cantent.

Table 3.3-XI shows the possible UCl3 molar contents under various
temperature restrictions. RbCL excels for a SSOOC limit; KCl or RbCL
for 600°C. At 650°C all alkali chlorides show potential, though KCl
and CsCl excel. Alkaline earth chlorides don't work until the low temp-—

erature limit exceeds 7OOOC.

If one wents a high~actinide 30 NaCl/70 UCl; mix then the lowest
core salt temperature allowab.e (with a little safety margin) is 7500C.
With a 50/50 NaCl/UCl3 mix th: temperature can drop to nominally 650°C.

Section 3.3.1.3 mentioned that ternary and higher compoment mix~
tures can further lower the melting point. Figure 3.3-26 presents four
ternary diagrams for UClB-UClthkCl, vhere Ak=alkali or alkaline earth.
Cne desires to optimize the U()lB/'UCll+ ratio so as to hald down temperature
(which affects corrosion) as well as the content of corrosive UClh.
Keeping the U/Ak ratio high maximizes spectrum hardness and BG potential.
Unfortunately, the isotherms and the eutectic mep. tend awey from hizh
gg&B cantent., Ternary mixtures with two AkCl components behave similarly
(Fig. 3.3-27). In summary one must tradeoff low melting point (low
U-~III content) and corrosion (high Ak content) against large spectrum

hardness and BG potential (high U~III content).

The blanket salt will generate little heat; therefore, a low m.p.

1 temperature will facilitate its handling. High ThCl, content maximizes
BG there. Carrier-salts whose eutectic mixtures with ThClI+ (Fig. 3.3~
28) seem to qualify are PbCl,, LiCl, NaCl, and KCl. They also form
suitable eutectics with the small amownts of UClh present (Fig. 3.3-29).
PbCl2 has a sitight disadvantage in that Pb is divalent, further in-
creasing parasitic capture by chlorine.

Under an arbitrary operating design limit of ane U atom per 10
Th atoms and low Ak content (to avoid blanket power cooling and BG loss)
ternary UClA/ThClh/AkCl (Fig. 3.3-30) mixtures do not significantly
lower the meiting point: all eutectic points lie at high UClh and

carrier salt contents,

Fluoride blanket salt presents another altermative, TLip (riz.
3.3-32) could best lower the molting point and thermalize the blanket
neutron spectrum without parasitically capturing neutrons. NaP looks
next best, However fluorides solidify near TOOOC and eutectic effects

do not appear until ThF, molar content falls disastrously (to BG) low

The eutectic points which minimize KCl content are 5.5 u013/u5 UClh/
49.5 XC1 for a m.p. of 314°C, or 17 UC1,/26 UCL, /57 XC1 for a mep. of

518°C. With NaCl ane might opt for a m.p. of 339°C at 17 ueL,/

4.5 UCL, /42.5 NaCl or 432°C at 21.5 UCLy/29.5 UCL, /49 NaCl. The CaCl,

ternary offers no attractive eutectic points.

Nane of the above points have UClB/UClh> 1; that could spell
corrosion troubies (Sect. 3.4.2.2). Still, temperature affecis cor-
rosicn as well, so that high UClh courd yet be worthwhiie. Of the
five cases mentioned above the mix with mep. 33900 locks the best.

Ternary mixtures of ThFh/UFh/AkF behave like their chloride
counterpart: no eutectic poimts occur with high ThFh content.
Mixing in two carrier salis with ThF, doesn't help either (Fig.
3,3-33): +the well known MSBR salt Flibe Ber/LiF) combines with
ThF, or UF, %o reach melting points of 400~500°C, but only at 12
ThF4 (for 50000). Flibe also suffers because Be is scarce and Li
produces T unless enriched in 7Li,

Figze Je3=6 showed aigher halides %o have lower melting points,
but they nave other problems,
3u3ele5 3Boilinr noint and vnvor nressurz, Chlorides of Cz, X, la
and Mg all boil in the same range, 1400=1600°C, Their differences
are insignificant because UCl4 (792°C) and ThCl4 (92800) pose much
lower limits. The boiling points of UCl, and PuCl, are unknown,

3 3
but their melting points compare with those of the carrier salts.

3.3.4.6 Chemical behavior. Halogens react vigorously with the al—
kali metals to form a very stable binary ccmpound. Salts of alkaline
earths also exhibit large free energy for formatien (Fig. 3.3-12).

Fb halides are not so stable: O0BW. [13] found PoCl, 4o react with the

structural materials available then, They zlso found Zrél2 to cause

2 Snowy Ddrecitiiate.

In addition to having high melting points, alkali halides conduct
electricity in the molten state, and otherwise behave like electro-
valent compounds. Uith the excepticn of lithium fluoride, they readily

dissolve in water.

3.3.h7 Cest and availability. NaCl is very abundant and cheap. This
reduces both direct capital and fuel cycle costs; it also allows other

options such as substitution of fresh for radicactive haCl.
3.3.4.8 Density. The densities of the principal (lighter) candidate

carrier salts (Table 3.3-XITI) differ little compared to those of ThCL,

UClB, and UClh.
Due to differences in molecular weight, a 50-50 molar mix of
actinide and carrier salt means about an €515 weight mix, respectively.

Thus the actinide salt density controls the final density.

discussion recommend the lighter-weight—salts, and all the alkali
chlorides.

A FCY including the density factor‘fp‘a (Fise 3¢3-35) aczin
discourages only the heavier alkaline earth chlorides, CsCl and FhCl,

look very good then.

In summary, LiCl, MgCl2, and NaCl look to be the most attractive,

However, as pointed out above, the advantage of a second carrier
salt disappears when the actinide salt predominates.

Similarly, ORNL in 1963 [§] and ANL in 1967 [21] reported
studies on carrier salt mixtu;es of NaCl, KCl andegClz but with
only 30 and 18-50% mole of actinide chloride present, respectively.

Taube [17] generally assumes NaCl alone as carrier salt even
with low actinide contents. He mentions alsc further study of
NaF/ZrF,, but Section 3.3.2.9 precludes F from the core. The

British [29] also choose NaCl by itself.,

3e3+4+t1  Summarve Table 3.3-XIII summarizes the” intercozparison of
carrier salt cations. The goal of keeping the core spectrum hard dis-
courages use of Be and Li there because of elastic downscatter; Ca and
X dovmscatter the least. lNa undergoes the most inelastic scatter; Ca
and ¥, the least. Parasitic neutron capture though small, exceeds by
magnitudes for Li and K over that for Ca, Mg, and Na. Ca transmutes
the least into radioactivity or troublesome chemicals.

Caticn choice on the basis of eutectic melting point depends on
the range of acceptable actinide molar contents. Boiling points far
carrier chlorides olay no role as they far exceed those for actinide
chlerides. . The chenical stability of the 2lxali chlorides (NaCl and
KC.L) surpasses that of the aixaiine earth chiorides (i-lgCl2 and CaClz).
laCl abounds by far the most in nature and costs the least., Salt density
affects pumping power needs but the higher densities of the actinide
chlorides dwarf any differences due to carrier salt choice. The light
alkalis transfer heat the best.

In summary, ¥aCl costs little and exhibits good physical and
chemical properties. K and Ca feature better nuclear properties for
the core sait but the much higher Cl concentration obscures them. Na
and 7Li look best for the blanket sali. Final choicc must weigh these
relative advantages plus the location of eutectic melting points near

the desired actinide molar fraction.

3.3.5 Choice of Helative Proporticns of Actinide and Carrier Salt .

In the core we want to avoid nuclei which neither fission nor breed,
but only dovmscatter and capture neutrans. This means maximizing the
fissile enrdichment and the ratio of actinide-~to—~carrier salt. It is
also important to maximize the fuel salt heat transfer ccefficient at
an average fuel temperature of 800 -85000; hf comprises the parameters

In sunmary there are both pros and cons re Th presence which are

potential and the useful conzumpiion of the actinide§ argue for low
Th concentration ([Th]) while [Th] ——== O could mean too freguent z
replacement of the core tubes, Practically, reactor operation could
start with high [Th] and wide tubes and later change to low [Th] and
smaller tubes as confidence in the tube wall life develops, This ver-
satility would probably require only the inclusion of a few extra tube
ports in the reactor vessel,
3e3e5+2 Density. This study principally involves U013’ Nall, and
ThClq. NaCl molar content may vary only between 30 and 70% to achieve
eutectic melting point lowering, Pigure 3,3~36 shows the density for
various ThCl4/U013 ratios using the densities and the prescription for
their addition from section 3¢3e1e5e

For a Pu013/2 UCl3/3.16 NaCl mix, Taube and Davudi [123] listed

p =292 g/ce at 850°C; for 15 PuCl3/85 NaCl, 2 = 2.12 gfcc. These
values both seem low compared to Fige 343-36 (though different
actinide salts are involved). In the same repori these authors quote
/cr= 3,526 g/cc for a 1 Pu013/2 UCl3/3.65 ¥aCl mix at 850°C, which
seems nighe

The 1963 ORNL paper [6] listed a density of 3.08 g/cc at 643°C
for a 45 NaCl/25 KCl/3O (PuCl3 + UCl3) mix, Since density decreases
vith increasing temperature, that value supports Figure 3.3-36. The
earlier 1956 ORNL study [13] used /0 = 25 g/cc for 2 3 NaCl, 2 HgClz,

3e3.5.7 Choice of core mix. A pure fissile fuel would produce
the hardest neutron spectrum but an MSR requires carrier salt
admixture to reduce the melting point. Adding fertile salt
to the core mix helps reach BG potential by reducing leakage
through increased fertile capture, but it also lowers the BG
potential by softening the core neutron spectrum. Another
consequence will be to increase the critical mass of fissile
kkuel and the core size, This will be good for power density
(Fig. 3.5~15) and in-cors to out-of-core inveniory ratio (for
control purposes), but there are limits to economical plant
size.

An alternative to fertile fuel in the core is to increase
the size of the outer blanket. However, this also increases
the size of the overall reactor system.

The ORNL/56 design limited the actinide concentration to
17 mole precent actinide chloride. Of this, 2/3 of the actinide
was fertile material. The prime motivation was to keep the
liquidus temperature below SOOOC, to avoid what were then exotic
ctructural meterials,

The British [29] chose an actinide molar conceniration of
30-4055 the Fremch [23], 30%,following the earlier lead of LNL [217.
The. readoas for these choices are not clearly stated, However, we
suspect they include ~. . -.

l. Keeping the power density low

2. Keeping down the plant fissile inventory

3. Improving the thermophysical properties.

This study assumed 70% for most of the physics analyses so as to
 

fully explore the advantages of a hard spectrum: power density is
reduced by using a geomeiry with high surface/volume ratio and limited
fertile fuel presence (limited reduction in enrichment), By and large
<hie enrichment problem is ignored because all fuels have weapons capa~
bility but 232U;bearing 233U, the least so, The better thermophysical
properiies from higher carrier salt content are sacrificed for the sake
of the highly~desirable hard spectrum and attendant high BG potential.
3ele5¢8 Choice of blanket mix, Since the blanket generates little
heat, it can avoid high temperatures, This should

1. Preclude corrcsion of the reactor vessel

2. Allow more choices Zor the reactor vessel material

3. Reduce auxiliary hezting needs

For low temperature operation the salt composition should lie
near the eutectic point(s), but on the side high in actinide content
for bigh BG, The French and Swiss MCFR(U/Pu) desigas assume 65% us,

and 353 NaCl; the British, 40% UCl, and 60% NaCl, For a NaCl/UCl

3 3
miz the eutectic point occurs at about 65% NaCl; for NaCl/ThClA, at

about 70% WaCl. Ve assume here a 65% ThCl, and 35% NaCl, XCl, or

3.3.,5.9 Butectic mix for flush salt. Section 349.5 proposes flush
operations for rcmoving residual radioactive salt in core and blanket,

The best mix for this purpose would probably be the eutectic composi-

tion of the blanket feed: with the NaCl/ThCl system, any mix between

a
25 and 50% NaCl would be good (Fige 343-22).

3¢4 Structural Materials

To find materizls of suitable sirength and endurance one must
anticipate the environment and the response of materials to it,
Environment includes radiation, temperature, pressure, fluid compo-
sition, chemical additives, condensation, and vaporization. Haterial
response depends on mechanical stremgths, metallurgical phases, and
chemical interactions (corrosion).

Requirenents on the material will include suifable thermophysiczl
oroperties, ability to fabricate and weld, product availability, and

existence of pertinent experience for the material,

3.4.,1 feneral Ccpsiderations and Criteria

3.4e1e1 Plant-life economics, Initial study usually suggests several
economical meterizls. The material cost is important, but the {rue
installed cost depends also on size, pipe schedule, system complexity,
joint make-up, fabrication techniques, and labor rates, Dovmiime and
life expectancy, functions of the material response, will affect the
ongoing maintenance costs, Fortunately, metals usually have xmown
corrosion rates,
3.4.1.2 Corrosion, general [80, 126]. The most important engineer-
ing task is likely to be finding materials which resist corrosion by
fuel and blanket salt mixtures containing fission products and other
impuritiess This may require a irade-off with system conditions such
as lowering temperature, decreasing velocity, or removing oxidizers,

Alternately one might sacrifice some corrosion resistance
for higher strength; also, the best material might not be readily

available, The most desirable material will probably combine

202
 

moderate cost with reasonzble life. Sometimes the environment condi-
tions change with {time: The structural materizl must handle that or
be changed also, ZIxperimental loops under similar reactor oper-ting
conditions are thus inveluzable: +they allow one %0 examine aciuzl cor-
roded pipe, valves, and fitiings.
Hany factors can affect corrosion, some of which may be obscure,
The questions below help in evaluzting them:
1e ilnat 1s the composition of the corrosive fluid?
2. What is the concentration (specific gravity, pH, efc.)?
3. What is the operatinz temperature and pressure?
Le Is water present ai any time?
Se Is air present, or is the opportunity for air-leaks high?
6o Is the system ever flushed, rinsed, or drained out?
Ta Is a slight amount of corrosion objectionable from a contam-
ination standpoini?
8s Has any specific trouble or problem been experienced with
certain materials?
9¢ ‘That materizls are being, or have been, used for valves
and Tittizgs?
10e What were the comparative lives o the materials used?
11e Are there special fabrication, handling, or installcotion
problems?
12, hat is the estimated instzlled cost or capitalized cost
for the projected life of the piping?
Metallurgical structure markedly affects corrosion resistance:

fortunately it can often be altered, Physical chemistry and its

203
various disciplines are most useful for studying the mechanisms
of corrosicn reactiocns, the surface conditions,of metals, and other
basic properties.
3e4.1.3 Corrosion by electrochemical attack [80]. Under chemical
attack, metal ions leave anodic areas of the surface and enter into
the solution, thus dissolving the surface, This creates an etched
affect. In the solution they chemically react with other elements
such as oxygen, chlorine, etc., to form nommetallic compounds; plateout
of these darkens the surface witk = protective, passive film., ¥xamples
include rust on irom, oxide layer on aluminun, and "passivation"™ of
stainless steel by immersion in niiric acid.

While they remain intacw, such films generally protect the metal

or 2t least vetard further degradation. However, high stream veloci-

 

ties, vibration, and thermal shock can all break the film conftinuity.
The pickling of pipe to remove mill scale illusirates controlled cof;
rosion by direct attack,

Galvenic action, or bimetal corrosion, exemplifies another common
mechanicme, Two dissimilar metzls establish an elecirical potentizl
vhen they contact, or connect by an electrical pathway, in the presence
of a conducting solution (electrolyte).

In bolted joints, such as pipe flanges, the relative sizes of the
anodic and cathodic areas become important., An anodic area that is
small in relation to the cathodic area accelerates the corrosion.
Where flanges and bolts are dissimilar metals, the boliing metal

should be cathedic to the flange metal,

3.441s4 Corrosion protection [80, 126]. The means of reducing
corrosicn include

(1) Use of corrosion-resistant metals and alloys

(2) Protective coatings such as paint, electroplating, etc,

(3) Cathodic protection by the use of 2 sacrificial metal

Impervious graphite - for handling hydrofluoric, sulfuric, and
nitric acids = has some temperafure znd concentration limits., It is
unsuitable for use with free bromine, fluorine, and iodine, as well
as chromic acid and sulfur trioxide, Normally, its poraosity mzkes
graphite unsuitable as a2 piping material; however, various resins
used as impregrmants will proiuce ar impervious material. The pipe
manufaciurer should know what corrosives are to be handled so he
can provide the proper impregnant, A concern here would be the
effects of high radiation on the organic resin as well as the
graphite.

The use of lined piping sysfems for corrosive surfaces is rap-
idly increasing, Linings include glass, plasiics, elasiomers, and
various metals. Lined pipe systems usually rely on carbon steel as
a main struciural component: ease of fabrication and low cost permit
its use with most linings and manufacturing techniques, Glass;lined
steel pipe has one of the broadest ranges of corrosion resistance of
2ll,s It's smooth surface improves product flow, but it has poor
impact and thermal shock resistance, requiring care and handling
during installation and maintenence, Thermal shock resistance could
be a valid concern where one plans to completely and quickly remove

the fuel from the primary circult, several {imes per year.

3.4.1.5 Thermal and radiation~induced expansicn. Temperature and
radiation will cause most materials to expand. This will affect the
choice of materials for core tubes, reactor vessel, and wt—of-reactor
equipment (pipes, pumps, heat exchangers) for primery, secondary,

and tertiary I:ircuits. Table 3.4=1 gauges thermal expansion for éome

materials of interest: both Mo and graphite look attractive.

Core tubes need to be far enocugh apart that expansion does not
cause stresses by forcing them together. Design for langitudinal ex-
pansicn will prevent bowing and/or breakage (of graphite).

Proper layout should accomodate expansion in ocut=of=-reactor piping.
Expaneion effects in a pump or heat exchanger are more critical: for—

tunately radiation levels there, from delayed neutrons,are near three

magnitudes below that in the core.

3.L.2 Chemical Reactions in an MCFR

Compatible ccntainment materials are those which do not form
stabie chlcrides. ZExamples =re graphite, iron, nickel, and the re-
fractery metals. The chloridesof the pure fuel salt are hignly
stable, reacting little with materials they contact. However,
over the reactor life the core and blanket salts will mutate into
a variety of,compositions, begetiing additional chemical species:
fissicn products and free chlorine from figsion; other mutants
through neutron capture; oxygen creeping in through seals. For-
tunately, fluid systems can reprocess continuously (Section 3.7),
which helps to keep these impurities low.

Chemical reactions between these salt mixtures and inccm=
satible-container materials could

1. Precipitate fissile material leading to criticality safety

problems

2. In the presence of high temperatures, high velocities, and

high radiaticn fields, cause corrosion leading to leakage

and maintenance problems.

207
3.4.2.1 Reactions with fissimn-produced mutants. When uranium fissimns,
the UCl3 mclecular structure breaks up, crgating three chlorine ions and
two fission products (FP). Table 3.4~IIL [9] gives the valencies of.tnese
these-FP ia their most stable state (largest free.edergy of formation
[17,82,86,127] at reattor temperatures).

The FP will oanly form chlorides if the free enthalpy of formatim
exceeds about 20 kilojoules per mole chlorine: FP up to and including
molybdenum in Fig. 3.4-1. The gases xenmn, Efyptcn, and probably iodiné
and bromine are inert to chloridization; so are the more inert metals
such as palladium, technetium, ruthenium, rhedium, and probably tellur- '
ium. Based on MSRE experience , they will either entrain with the inert

gases or plate out an metal surfaces.

This suggests the production of about 80 kg insoluble metal per

Experience on molien fluoride systems indicates that irradiation
and fission products do not accelerate corrosion (lMcLain pe800)

Molybdenum as a fission product with a yield of lai (out of 200%)
of all fission products may remain, in part, in metallic form. When
molybdenum is the structural material, the corrosion problems of metal-
lic molybdenum or its alloys are strongly linked with the fission product
behavior in tnis medium. Fission fragment MoCl, will react with UCl3
to form UCLA plus Mo. Likewise the excess chlorine released will react
with the strongest reducing agent present, UClS, to form UClh.
3.4.2.2 The efféct'ofUCl; —resence in the core salﬂ-tsij. re UC1L,
highly corrodes container me-als, but both theory (stability of cor- |
rosion product chlorides) and labcratory experience show that dilute—UClh
fuel salt attacks little: alloys of ircn, nickel, or refractory metals
such as molybdenum resist chlofide fuel and blanket salts, providing
the UClB/UClh mix contains no mere than a few percent UCL, . Alloys can
also include minor amounts of more reactive metals such as chromium if
the design allows for same surface leaching.

Extrapolating from CEXL experience with fluoride fuel salts at
comparable heat ratings, irradiation should neither release chlorine

from the melt nor enhance the attack of the cantainer materials.

211
3.4.3 Candidate Materials for an MCFR

The high flux levels in an MCFR suggest high radiaticn damage,
However, due to the unique tube configuration the only exposed struc-
ture is the core/blanket interface: the blanket shields the vessel,
reducing its radiation dose by three magnitudes.

Beycnd the high radiation environment of the reactor lie piping,
pumps, and heat exchangers for the primary fuel-ccolant. These face
exposure to high temperatures, delayed neutron irradiation, and corrc—
sicn by salt transmutant impurities.

Materials in the secandary and possible=tertiary circuats wilil
face a much milder enviraument. However, the amounts of materials
there greatiy surpass those ir the primary circuit, thereby sensi-
tizing their cost: except for the high temperature helium case, one
prefers lower operating temperatures so as to allow cheaper materials.
The cost factar, however, must also be balanced with factors of corrosion,
thermal stress, and avoidance of secondary-coolant freezing (especially
for active liquid metal) on the intermediate heat exchanger tubes.

Table 3.4=IIT 1lists the most promising materials for use with the
different fluids. Strength cansideraticns dictate the temperature iimits.
Corrosion tests under MCFR conditions have generally not been carried
out yet. Materials which best resist corrosion by chemical attack
should be those with small free energy of chloride farmation (Fig. 3.4-1).
Low vasor pressure (high boiling and melting points) will also allow
chlorides which form to remain as protective coverings. From avail-

able information (Figse 3.4-1 and 3.4-2) Mo is a strongcardidate..-

Superior sirenzgth and resistance to corrosion and radiation embrittle
ment at high temperature recommend molybdenum alloys (particularly TZH)
for contact with the circulating fluid.

There is some incentive for using molybdenum alloys for all the
components (including pumps) which contact the salt., However massive
molybdenum outside the core would require precautions against its
external oxidation: e.ge enclosing the reactor vessel and other sensi-
tive components in a hot box purged with an inert or slightly reducing
atmosphere, An alternctive to this would be to use duplex material:

steels,

For the less severe conditions of the reactor vessel and the salt
ducts returning from the heat exchanger, Hastelloy-N c¢r advanced devel-
opments of that alloy might suffice, However, having decided to use
melybdenum for the core/blanket membrane, a change to a dissimilar
metal elsevhere in the salt circuit could cause galvanic corrosion.
Also, nickel alloys resist molten lead (a2 candidate secondary coolant)
very poorly compared with molybdenum; they would probably be subject
to attack when the lead leaked fthrougn the heat exchanger into the salt,
3044342 o 2lloys. Mo offers high temperature sirength, zood irra-
diation resistance, and high thermal conductivity: promising traits
for 2 material in contact with fuel and blankev salts at hizh temper-
atures, However, fabrication of light molybdenum sections requires
welding and heat ftreatment: this technology needs development, but
it is already proceeding for other applications,

Also, the high specific cost of molybdenum is acceptzable only on
a2 limited basis: +the vessel piping, eic, should use materials which
are cheaper and more easily fabricated. Candidates include Mo/Fe,
Ho/Mli and Ti/Zr/Mo (TZ1) alloys. With Mo/Fe indications are that the
swelling for Fe has already peaked at the operating temperatures,
while that for Mo occurs 2t much higher temperatures,

The use of molybdenum or its alloys may permit high fuel salt
temperatures (above 100000). This can reduce fuel salt inventory
through higher power densities and allow gas turbine cycles and/or
process heat applications using helium as an intermediate and final

coolant,

215
Mo has an appreciable absorption cross section for neutrons. Such
reactions also produce significant amounts of technetium. This changes
the nature of the structural material and makes it radiocactive.

Figure 3.4=1 and the discussion in Section 3.4.2 indicated Mo to be

strengly corrosiaon resistant. The most significant reaction from the
standpoint of ccrrosicn shouid be (Fig. 3.3=13)

UClb, + Mo ———i < UCJ.3 + Mt:JCLL2
UCi 4 will be a major censtituent in the blanket from the neutron transmu-
fation of ThCla. Free chloride from fission of U in the core will combine

with UC].3 to form UClL. It also reacts directly with Mo:

Mo + 012 — Mo()l2

Traces of oxygen or water will produce molybdenum oxide, €.ge.

MoCJ.2 + H20 — MoQ + 2 HCL

With all of these reactions, mechanical properties will change.

3.4.3.3 Graphite. Both carbon and graphite resist corrosion
and conduct heat well enough to warrant exdsting uses in heat
exchangers and pumps. A resin-bonded graphite has found wide-
application in the chemical process industries. Both America
and France have used graphite with Li.F/BeF‘2 molten salt: Mce=-
Donnell~Dougl as markets a high-strength, woven graphite for this;
the French company PUK sells a product with graphite connected

to heat exchanger material [27].

The high thermal conductivity results in excellent thermal

216
 

shock resistance. Still one must exert care as carbon and graphite
are weak and brittle compared with metals.

Tensile strength varies between about 500 and 3000 lb/in.z,
and impact resistance is nil. Abrasion resistance is poor. Highe=
temperature stability is good. and they can be used at temperatures
up to 4000 or 5000°F if protected from oxidation (burning).
Silicon-base coatings (silicides or silicen carbide) and iridium
coatings are claimed to give protection up to around 2900°F.

Based on the existing experience as a structural material
for molten fluoride thermal breeders and on periodic replacement
of tubes, we assumed graphiie for the physics studies here: 2 cm

thick for the tube wall anc 4L cm thick for the vessel wall,

1.4.3.4 Heat exchanger considerations. As mentioned in sectian 3.3.2.5
low vapoer pressure of the primary and secondary fused salts permits
thin-walled heat exchangers. These are highly efficient in heat transfer,
thereby decreasing necessary area and fissile volume out-ofecore.

However, assuming close pitch, they will require development

and testing to resist the thermal and vibrat onal strains over

a long working life.

Refractory metals are attractive as they can accommodate high tem—-
pefatufeslﬁhiie»still affording the good heat transfer of a metallic
material. A strong candidate is Mo, It does have an appreciable cross
section for neutron absorption: +this affects delayed-neutron activation
but not neutron ecanemy or radiaticn damage there. Of greater cancern

is the welding and joining properties of Mo, its cost, and its oxidation.

217
3,4.4 Materials for the Core/Blanket Interface

_Finding an interface material that can withstand a 1016 n cm-'2
éeo;1 flux over an acceptable period of time is indeed a challenge,
It is greatly eased by assuming periodic replacement of the few tubes:
an action far less complicated thar the conventional replacement of
fuel elements; just drain the core and blanket and uncouple the tubes
outside the reactor, This is especially feasible if one uses a cheap
material like graphite. Section 3.9, Access and Haintenance, discusses
this further. Still the tubes may experience a cumulative dose of 1023

n cm-2 in just a few months, Also irradiation of graphite produces

"stored energy'.

ledeH HMaterials for Reactor Vessel

 

The reactor vessel will experience

(1) Low pressure

(2) Temperature higher than the blanket salt meliing point

(3) Radiztion damage from a 10'3 1 em™? sec”! flux.
A suitable material must meet these conditions; it should also mini-
mize

(1) Induced radioactivity so as to maximize access

(2) Cost

Candidates include graphite and prestressed concrete (of low=

activating compositions),

3e4.6 lMaterial for a Lead Secondary Circuit
34446,1 Steam generator tubes, Mo alloys normally resist lead cor-
rosion well, bul mizht not if a steam generator lezked in small amounts
of oxysene Dissolving Mg or Ca as a getter in the lead would help
lower the oxygen level, but might not suffice, One could also clad
the molybdenum with an alloy which resists "oxygenated" lead; Fecraloy,
2 ferritic sfeel containing 2luminum, forms a protective alumina
film under these conditions,

A third, untried alternative, might be that Fecraloy alone can
resist both steam and oxygepated lead, Forming a duplex with staine
less steel could overcome ifs poor high temperature strength,

The Dossibllity of m2ii-g the neat exchanger tubes of Hastelloy-

3ede 7 Material for a Helium Secondary Circuit

The main change relative 1o the lead-cooled design is bigher.tcm=-
peratures, parallel to a core temperature increase from 810 to 970°C.
This suggests the need for molybdenum alloys, especially on mechanical
grounds, However, even though there is no reason to doubt their cor-
rosion resistance at this temperature, any supporting evidence is come
2letely lacking, British studies showed {that design variations might
lower the sa2lt pump operatinz temperature from 800°C %o 67000. This
would ease the engineering and the selection of materials,

Materials selection for helium cooling should ve much easier than
for lead cooling but so far has been little studied: unidentified orob-
lems could become just as ch:;lenging as with lead-cooled sysiems.

Presumably a helium cooled system could draw on the exteﬁ;ive
work already done with respsct to HTRs and gas turbines: The MCFR
version could actuwally ride on the future HTR program,.

HTR programs have recognised that, in practice, helium is not
an inert coolant since iraces of air, moisture and other oxidizing
gases can cause corrosion and traces of carbonaceous ges can car-
burice structural materials, Thoush much work remains it does seenm
likely that it will be possible to specify

3.5 Physics of MCFR(Th) and Its Fuel Cycle

3.5.1 Nuclear Models of an MCFR

J.5.1.1 Definition of the reactor geometry. Section 3.l1.3 conclud—
ed that the best MCFR arrangement might be a small number of skewed
cylindrical tubes. The chain reaction will center where the tubes
converge. However, as nc fuel salt boundaries exist along the tube
ares, criticalitiy boundaries blur,

High levels of flux and power generation in the primary salt
may extend far along the tubes. This will depend on individual tube
subcriticality, distance of separation between tubes, and angle of
their skew. For example, if they are near critical by themselves and
are distant from one another, then their fluxes will follow a cosine
distribution over the total distance between bends. ‘However, ine
creasing the intertube'coupling will cause the fluxes within the tubes
to fall off more steeply beyond the tube convergence region.

Th concentration and other fuel salt parameters will also affect
neutron distributions because they moderate the neutrons which short-
ens their mean free path. Fluxes will also extend into the blanket
in all directions but with much shorter relaxation lengths.

The choice of tube arrangement will depend upon a detailed trade
study of effective core size: extension of the chain reaction out
along the tubes will increase exposure of the pressure vessel to
neutrons emanating from the tubes; making the core size small re-

duces stability of the system to perturbations.

221
3.5.1.2 Use of spherical geometry for neutronic calculations.

Neutronics analyses of complicated geometiries require expensive Monte

Carlo calculations. For.the present survey purposes, it should .

suffice to use simple one-dimensional spherical geometry featuring
five zones (Fig. 3.5=1): core, core tube wall, blanket, vessel wall,

and reflector.

 

 

 

. —7 __——core L7 — reactor
tube vessel
II wall wall
E core blanket | reflector

 

 

Fig. 3.5~1 Cne-dimensional Spherical Model

All the tube wall material gets lumped into one spherical shell.
The validity of this approach, vs. uniform material distribution in
the spherical core, will depend upon the number of actual tubes. For
only three or four tubes, the current thinking, it should do quite well.

Taking the tube wall thickness to be two cm facilitates compar-—
isons with MCFR(Pu) studies. The vessel wall is four cm thick; the
reflector zone, 4O cm. A check calculation with 20 em reflector-
thickness showed no significant changes when the blanket thickness
was 200 cm (quasi-infinite).

éection 3.5.7.2 studies the effect of blanket thickness, settling
on a value of 200 em for most cases. The critical core radius usually

ranges 25.-= 50 cm.

222
Section 3.3.5.6 gives the densities of individual salts and an
algorithm for combining them. Densities for graphite and nickel were
0.1 and 0.09 atoms cm * barn™l.

A primary difference between an exact calculation and those in
spherical geometry is likely to be the spectrum softening and other
effects of the ThClA/NaCl blanket salt intermediate between the fuel
salt tubes. Depending on the clearance and skew angle between tubes,
a smeared model of such a spherical region would probably include 5=
25% blanket salt by volume.

In this regard, the calcilations may be better cdone in infinite-
cylinder gecmetry. That remzins to be shown however,iand cylindrical
calculations cost more. In the meantime, spherical c;itical U masces
(U) or ¥slumes Gan be corrected to -cylindrical geometry by use of -
shape factors:

Je5.2 Neutronic Calculational Methods

Neutronic analysis of small fasi reactors like MCFRs generally
requires transport theorye. Mcdeling the reactor as a one-=dimensional
symmetric sphere permits use of the well established and efficient
ANISN code [129].
3.5.2.7 Spatial mesh. A spatizl mesh of 1/10 of a2 mean free path
£cr interval would give quasi-exact results in transport theory
calculations, Computer storage and cost generally prohibit this,

A mesh of one mean path (mfp) per interval suffices for most cal-
culations,

In MCFR(Th) calculations, the neutron mean free vath typically
ranges from 1-10 em (Teble 3,5-II), With a core radius of 30-80 cm,
a 200 cm blanket and a 40 cm reflector, a uvniform one mfp interval
mesh would mean a lot of intervals, PFurthermore, most would lie
outside the core, leading to possible numerical instability in the
iterative transport theory calculations, Consquently a coarser mesh
was used (Table 3.5-II), especially outside the core, This worked
fine for most of the survey calculations; 2 few select effects needed
finer detail,

showed increased neutron leakage as expected, but only increased the

3e5.3 Neutron Cross Sectians

This study required neutron cross sectians for Th, 233U, 23l‘U,
235U, 2330 fission products, C, Na, Ni, and Cl. Data for 236U, Mo,

F, and other carrier salt catlons were desirzble,

3.5.3,1 Bandarenko 26 group set [98]. - The Bondarenkc neutron crbss
sectlon library long ago =stablished itself for fast réazctsr caleu-
lations, Testing has revealed deficiencies in the Pu isotopes, 235U,

238

and U, but these nuclei by and large do not appear in an MCFR(Th).

Less is known in general about Th and 233U crdss sections; they are. cur-
rently undergoing extensive reevaluation for ENDF/B-S; For survey
ournoses nhere, the 3ondarenk: values in Pl-cor-ecied PO form (trans-
port cross sections) should suffice, :

 Nuclei ﬁiésing from ihe library are Cl and F. Early in the
study, K substituted for Cl: this was conservative as K absorbs
more neutrons. Final calculations used Cl and FPl sets derived from

ENDF/B - IV.

 3.5.3.2 Twenty-six group, P1 set from ENDF/B-IV. Available
late in this study was a 92-group Pl set of cross sections gener-
ated by AMPX [130] from ENDF/3-IV, containing most of the materials
of interest here. This was too large and expensive to run so the
set was collapsed to 26 groups similar (Table 3.5-III) to those in
the Bondarenko library to allow cross—comparison and -usage.
The list of materials included not cnly Cl but also F. Missing
however were Na and C. Comparison of their nuclear properties indicat~
ed Mg would represent Na well, especially since Na content is small

campared to Cl. For C, the Bondarenko set was used ; C ic also a minor

3.5.3.3 Effects of resonance self-shielding. Résdnance—regicn
cross sectims for the two sets described above were averaged
assuming the materials to be infinitely dilute, i.e. ignoring
resonance self-shielding. In 233U most of the reactiviiy effects
from fission and capture self-shielding, if present, would cancel

each other. Self-shielding for 232Th capture, if present, could
affect 8G.

The Bondarenko-calculated self-shielding factors for capture

(Table 3.5I7 ) show virtually no self-shielding in the top 12

grcups, which cover well ths core and blanket spectra. %“hat little

the Th cycle burnup chein as it pertains to reactor criticality. 233Pa
branching ~ by neutron capture to 234y or by‘ﬁa- decay to 233y ; is
very important in a thermal reactor where 234U only absorbs neutrons.
However, in 2 fast HCFR(Th) spectrum 234y mostly fissions (Figure
Zel=3) ;-- much more so than any other fthreshold-{ission isotope. It
does not significantly moderate the spectrum or otherwise detract.
33 232Th: 233

2
Production of ~~~Pa follows directly from

233

Th decays

quickly enough to ignore i1ts dresence, Pa decays at the rate of

1n 2/27.0 days = 3.0 x 10-7 disintegrations per second per 233Pa 210Mma

With g = 10" 5 en? s in core (25% of +ime), ~ O oui-~of-core, and

a core-spectrum-averaged cross section of 0.3 barns (Table 3,5-V),

233Pa(n,Y) reactions oceur 0.7 x 107 3-1, more than two magnitudes

233

slower than Pa decay, In the blanket the greatly~reduced flux
lowers the reaction rate even further, A fhermal reactsr with<3é200 =
39b and f = 104 5 en™® s 0,25 yields a similar rate of 1 x 1077
s [1313.

In summary, 234U production from 233Pa parallels that in 2
thermal reactor; but a low-threshold fission cross section raises it
to fissile fuel status and also destroys it faster. Therefore ihe
reduced presence of 234U and the 233U;like reactivity behavior of
234U in an IICFR obviate the need for separating out 233?& to let it
decay as in an USBR, Therefore it suffices in these survey calcula~

tions to igmore the 233p, (n,¥ ) branch, i.e. to construe all 232

3.5.4.2 Chain for buildup of “<U-parented radicactivity. < <U
buildup in the fuel merits special attention because it heads a

lengthy decay chain (Figure 3.5=4) which culminates in 208’1‘1, the

emitter of a penetrating 2.61-MeV gamma ray.

The high-energy gamma necessitates remote handling of the re-
cycled fuel and complicates the fuel reprocessing and refabrication.
This discourages fuel diversion and theft as well as subsequent weapon
manufacture, For legitimate HMCFR operation, which requires no fuel
fabrication ard continuously reprocesses fuel anyhow, it poses no major

additional problem,

Some 228Th will actually exist prior 1o 232U production due to
232Th decay:

This might assist as a deterrent early in reactor overation due
to the 2.6~ileV gammz siznal, but being a different chemical element

Th will easily separate from the U fuel, Therefore it plays no sig-

nificant role here. No other isctope besides 232U should be initially

present,

Several paths lead o 232U in a Th/ 23‘U fuel cycle. Each starts

232

from a source material (enclosed in boxes in Figure 3.5=5). Th

31.5.5 Pertinent Physics Metrics

3.5.5.1 BG: actual breeding gain. The canventicnal definition

of BG is

rate of fissile production

BG = rate of fissile destructian

(345.5-1)

The question then arises: which materials are fissile and which
fertile? Conventian says 23 L'U is fettile, but in the very hard
HCFR neutron spectrum it behaves like a fissile: G exceeds Oy over

most of the neutrecn spectrum (Fig. 2.1-5), suggesting a bare

237 2L05 (159 kg),

or “*n (114 kg) {1351, 232y and 8U cannot sustain a chain
233:‘—' 23-4-1}', a-n.d 235" sy

critical mass smaller than that for Np (69 k&),

rzaction, Thus we lacel U as fissiles in an 0932,

232'3?3:1 and 238‘6 2s non-fissilcs,

BG can mean the instantaneous BG at any givén point in time (of
the burnup cycle) or a time-averaged BG such as over a given LMFBR re-
fuelling cycle or reactor life. As the survey nature of this study
precludes a detailed fuel management analysis, this study deals

anly with instantaneous BG, presumably on equilibrium cycle:

BG = Th capture rate

rate of 23 3“U ' 23 l‘U, 23 5U fission

This certainly differs in <°U treatment from that for a thermal Th/>>-U-
MSBR: however each reflects the physical realties of the correspanding

neutron spectra, and this definition does agree with equatian (3.5 5.-1)

above.

251
 

3.5.5.2 BGX: BG extended to zero neutron leakage. BGX
gauges the BG potential of a reactor design in the event that
neutrans which presently escape from the reactor (outer) blanket

(CB) were instead captured there in the same proportims as

present.

/ L;total abs rat?J

~

Th capture -]
BGX = (1+BG)§1 J-_--—._-— £ Z -1

OB

This metric thus indicates what additional BG can be obtained

through a larger blanket.

3.5.5.3 BGP: BG potential asscociated with the core spectrum.

The theoretical limit to BG forms another valuable metric of an MCFR(Th).

Taube calculated previously-unheard—of BG = 0.7-0.8 (BR = 1.7-1.8)
for an MCFR(Pu)e
Section 3.1.1.1 defined BG potentizl as the nﬁmsgr;of neutrons

available for breeding per 233U fission. That igrpored all actinides
5 232

excep Th .and 233U. The net result depended primarily on 30r

for 233U and indicated 2 potential for BGs up to 0.4 on the 232Th/233U

fuel cycle,

The ideal situatica would be for 232Th to capture neutrons which
leave the core: 1i.e. for none to leak out the blanket nor be lost to
parasitic capture, Then BG = Vy -2, However, for the MCFR here-we
must return from utopia and allow at least for parasitic losses due

to necessary core salt components. This then gives

3.5.5.8 Fuel inventory and doubling time. Doubling time (DT) provides
a pertinent measure of the economics and physics of a breeder reactor:
the time required to breed encugh extra fuel to start up another re-
actor. That should really encompass the whole fuel cycle: core +
blanket + primary loop + ineplant stockpiles + transport + fuel fab-
rication + fuel reprocessing + out=of=plant storage.

However, perhaps because solid fuel reactors all require similar
ex-reactor fuel cycies, DI conventionally measures just the time for
duplicating core and tlanket. To facilitate comparison, this study
adopts that definition also except that the MCFR must also include
its full primary circuit cantents:

Ui + U0 + Ub

DT = (3.5-5‘2)
BG production rate

Here
U; = U content inside the reactor vessel; more precisely be-
tween the ex—vessel bends of the tubes (Fig. 3.2-9,-10,
and-11)
U =

o = U inventory in primary circuit beyond (outside) the
reactor vessel: piping, pumps, and heat ekchangers.
Section 3.4 indicates the volume Vo = 23 m3.
Ub = Blanket U content
This should result in a conservative comparison of the MCFR
fuel cycle to the solid fuel cycle of other breeder reactors: solid
fuel will require much more inventory in storage, transportation,
decladding, and fabrication operations; the MCFR, little. Both

cycles should involve similar amounts of chemical processing, but

255
 

the MCFR goihg from liquid to liquid state, may require fewer steps

and therefore less U.

The odd geometry of the skewed tube configuration increases the
in-vessel U content, Uj} considerably beyond the calculated critical
spherical mass, U_. If there was only ane cylindrical tube (N=1)

then the volume Vi assoclated with Ui would be

Vi(N=l) = 'n‘n‘?L/z+ = VS/SF(L/D) (3e5¢5=3)
wiiere

v

s critical volume in spherical geometry

SF = L/D=dependent shape factor (Sece 3.5.1.2)

L = critical cylinder length. With a single cylinder, L = H

H = distance along tube between bends. Considering the 2
meter blanket surrounding the core, we estimate H = 5 m

D = critical cylinder diameter

Rearranging Eq. 3.5.53, get
L
L/D = (TrL3 SF(L/D) / & V) ' (3e545=4)
Since SF depends on L/D, Eqe 3.5.5=4 is transcendental: it must
be solved iteratively or by graphical intersection technigue.

If N> 1 and the tubes lay sufficiently apart from one another
(lcosely coupled), then ' (N > 1)=N vy (N=1). However, this is
not of interest because we prefer strong intertube neutronic coupling
(Section 3.1.3.2).

With strong coupling, if N tubes were not skewed but lay ad-

256
jacent to one another, then their combined cross sectional area
would appreach that of a single large tube, then

Vi(N >l) = Vl (Nzl) Of Eq. 305-5—3.
In contrast, when skewed the maximum, the tubes closely approach

ane ancther only near their midpoints. Then no tube sustains the
neutran chain reaction very well ogtside the close-approach zone,
The critical geometry of that zone should resemble a square cylinder
(L/D=1), somewhat squeezed at its middle into the shape of an hour
glass or a wheat stack (U).

The large mean free paths of fast neutrans tend to negate the
"tubular" protusions of core salt from this geometry: next colliéions

will probably occur in the neutron-absorbing blanket. Then with

Figure 3.5=7 displays the results of Eq. 3.5.53 and 3.5.55.
The di.i‘;'erences in V]-_- correspond to the differences between zero and
maximum skew angle respectively, Thus the true results would lie
intermediate, For the present study we take Vi at some value of low
significant figure slightly below the Eq. 345~7 line (for N=3), ' This
should result in a comservative estimate of DT, To get Uy or U we

3.5.6.2 BEquilibrium fuel cycle. We now study a specific situation of
interest - the equilibrium cycle where compositions have stabilized and
{cﬁgj /dtz each = O. The starter fuel does not affect the equilibrium

composition; only the feed material and neutron spectrum control it.
This section seeks to determine the relations which express

1. The equilibrium proportions of actinides in primary circuit

and blanket

2. The equilibrium breeding gain and/or reactor doubling time.

ANISN calculations provide the reaction probability rates (per
atom) {6 ¢>) « In addition we specify the core uranium concentration,
and blanket thiciness. Together with a critical core radius search,
this fixes Us ,Ths, and Thb. Nine unknowns remain: UBs' Ubs' U5s'
UBb' th, Ugps f, by, and c. There are seven equations, 3.5.6=1 =
3.5.6~7. That suggests that we also choose the reprocessing rates b

doubling time.

it degrades BG export (68) and increases doubling time (DT); it
also generates unwanted power and radicactivity in the blanket.

Figure 3.5-9 shows how increasing b quickly reduces Uy to nil.
The total U inventory (U,) then comprises just the primary circuit
contents, U; + Uj. Meanwhile, ﬁe rises from oblivion to its max=
imum level. Since Ut and UE vary with b in opposite directions,
their quectient DT (EqQ. 3.5.6=17) varies even more strangly with b
(Fig. 3.510). Core 233U/EBL‘U ratic also varies markedly with b in
Fig. 3.510.

All these comparisons argue for b2210-7, but not much beyond
thate Fige. 3.511 shows thzt high ¢ keeps 233U/231*U high and only
slightly affects DT adverse_y. It seems to warrant .c as high as
10_6/5, but not crucially so. Note that ¢ = 1077 implies a primary
Up removal rate of p=¢/% = ¢ Vs/tp. Thus the requirement on p will
typically fall a factor of 10 or more below (be far less stringent
than) that on c.

A rate of 10—6/5 implies the removal of 1 ppm of the U per second,
or a complete processing of that zcne every 11.6 days. Though that
may be doable, a rate of 10-7/5 or full processing in 116 days seems
more reasonable while imposing no severe penalty.

Detailled analysis in other studies shows the same b and ¢ be-

havior patterns there. Thus we adopt b=c=ld-?/s as a reference for

this woric, We also conclude that physical reprocessing limitations
should not prevent us from achieving near-optimum 233U/ZBLU ratio

and DT and small Ub.

3,5,7.1 Inner blanket study. Taube studied [17] inner blankets up

to 1.1 m in radius for spherical MCFR(Pu) and (fluoride) MFFR(Pu). 1In
each case the outer blanket remained cne—meter thick. With pure fissile
(no fertile) salt in the core, the BG slightly increased ‘for an MCFR(PU)

and decreased for an MFFR(Pu). Fig... 3e5~12 shows the changes by zone in
the MFFR(Pu study: inner blanket breeding increases with its volume,

er blanket thickness. Furthermore even if marginal BG advantages were
found, the added engineering complexity woﬁld probably discourage it.

To verify the effecﬁ of an inner blanket a study was made in spher—
ical gecmetry. Figures 3.5-13 and 3.5-14 show the results for‘a

what constituted an infinite (cuter) blanket thickness to BG. It assumed

no inner blanket. The study cansidered ThClL/UClB molar ratios in

was 30%. The results (Fig. 3.5-15) indicete that 2 m is near in-
finite.

Figure 3.5-16 shows that the ocuter blanket also shields the
vessel from the high core flux: a two-meter thickness reduces

to 0.3442 or 0.2%. The critical radius increased from 26,11

to 26,1, cm or 0.1% (a critical volume increase of 0.3%). Thus
cutting the reflector thickness in half barely shows up above the
accuracy of the calculaticns. 1his result cerresponds well to that
of the previcus secticn: namely that two meters censtitutes a

near-infinite olanket thickness.

Comparisan of C and i reflecters far a 3/1 Th/U core ratio and 5m
thick blanket showed no detectable differences. For a 0/1 Th/U core ratic
and 1-m thiek blanket, C performed much better (BG=0.106) than Ni (BG=
0.0L0); the critical core rziius differed little. The BG difference
probably stems from the moderating power of C: neutrons reflected by C
stand a much better chance of capture by Th than those reflected by Ni.
This recommends C for cases where.a non=infinite blanket is used. For

> 1.5=2.0 m thick blankets and 65/35 ThClh/NaCl mixture, a neutron re—

flector appears unneeded.

3.5.8 Reactor Design: Controlling the Core 233U/231‘U Ratio

Je5.8.1 Basis for studying the ratio. 23 I"'U cantent affects the
Section 2-adduced goals: hard neutran spectrum, high BG, and mine
irum presence of Pu and other heavy actinides. Although 23 L‘U
cantent is not a design (independent) variable but rather a physics
consequence (dependent variable), still design variables like NaCl/
UClB/‘IhCJ.l+ molar composition can influence it. Therefore we study
its effects as if it were an independent variable, loocking at 233 v/
23y o 3,45y and 7.

The MCFR model used as a basis in the study included a core salt

molar composition of 30/70/C NaCl/UClj/ThClh and a 200 cm blanket,

3.5,8.2 Effect of the ratic on spectrum, BG, and Pu presence.
Fig. 3517 shows that 23l‘U softens the neutron spectrum (( E} core
decreases. This is probably due to a higher {G’inel) /<G 56>
ratio for 23l‘U canpared to that for 233 Ue 23 LU also reduces BG and
power density. Table 3.5IX shows that the major BG reduction stems
directly from the lower (’U(S;-— Oc_> value for 23,4‘[1, not from spectral
softening. This same phenomenon decreases the reactivity of high

23 LU systems: that accounts for the larger critical volumes and lower
power densities.

Intuitively, a high ratio will minimize the presence of Pu and
other heavy actinides (the third goal): 234 heads the chain that
leads to them.

In summary, a high 233U/?'B}‘U ratio promotes all three goals of

hard neutron spectrum, high BG, and minimal Pu presence.

Because 23LU is a fissile MCFR fuel, the reactor U inventory varies
little in this study. However, the U export rate (Zq. 3.5.6~16) does
increase with decreasing 234y content, reaching 0.25 MT/yr for the
ratio 233U/?'BAU = 7. Figure 3.5-18 shows the consequent effect on
doubling time. This recommends a high 2'33U/231‘U ratio; however,

significant effort to reach higher ratios may not be warranted.

reaction rates and choosing b and c, the equations of Sece 345.8.2
specify the 233U'/234U ratio, However, this ratio for the fuel cycle
will depend on the reaction rates used. These, in turn, depend on
the ratio assumed apriori in the neutronic analysis of the equil-

3.5.9 Reactor Design: Choosing the Core Salt ThClL/UClQ Ratio
S -

To approach its BG potential (BGX or BGP) the reactor must
capture its excess neutrons in fertile material. One means of re-
ducing neutron leakage frem the reactor is to thicken the ocuter
blanket (Sec. 3.5.6.2) so that the fertile fuel captures or reflects
most of the neutrons which escape the core. Another way is to add
fertile material to the core fuel thereby reducing the core neutron
leakage. However, this also softens the neutron spectrum, which
lowers the BG potential (BGP).

With an MCFR(U/Pu) Taube reported [17] BG up to 0.7-0.8 with such
techniques. The following subsections study the optimum fertile

content in an MCFR(Th) core. They assume a salt mixture of 30%

280
 

NaCl and 70% (UCl3 + ThClh) and a 233U/231‘U ratio of 7/1.

3.5.9.1 Effect on BG. Fige 3.5~20 shows the results of ANISN
calculations. Neutrons leak significantly from a one-meter blanket
so the choice of reflector affects BG. Then cne prefers ThClk/UCl3 =
C.

When the blarnket thickmess exceeds 2.0 m however, few neutrons
leak and the reflector has little effect. [Th] = O then produces
the greatest BG because it engenders the hardestneutron spectrum
(Fige 3.5-21) and consequently, the most excess neutrons (Sec. 3.5¢5¢5).

Fig. 3520 also shows the BG from the 1956 ORNL study [13] of an
MCFR(Pu) which included a Pb core-reflector and a graphite-moderated
thin blanket. The larger ¥ value for Pu causes the high BG. Few
neutrons leak despite low fertile content, but this is because of
high (83%) carrier salt content. BG could actually be higher were
it not for the spectrum softening and neutron absorption by the
carrier salt.
3.5.9.2 Lffect on reactor fissile inventory and doubling times.
Substituting ThClh for UCl3 decreases density, However, the critical
core radius increases near proportionally, and volumé increases even
faster. Thus, overail, Th dilution increases the spherical critical
mass U (Fig. 3.5=22) and the corresponding mass in the tubes Us
(from Fig. 3.57). In contrast, the primary circuit volume outside
the vessel, Vo’ remains fixed, so U, decreases.

While V_ exceeds V., U,=U;+U _+U  decreases. (Ub plays little
role while b210-7.) Eventually the Th proportion reaches a level

where the internal volume Vi exceeds the fixed V,. Then Ut begins

In the 1956 ORNL study [13] of an NCFR(Pu) the minimum plant inven-
tory occurred a.1:: a 238U/Pu ratio of 2 (Fige 345-23), similar to this work.
The MCFR(Pu) total fissile inventory however lies roughly a factor
of 3 below that for the present MCFR(Th) study: the reason is great
dilution of the Pu fuel mixture by carrier salt(83% melar content).

In Fig. 3.524 the BG export rate fJe for b=c=10-7/ s (defined
“ by Eqe 3.5.6=16) stays fairly constant as the core Th/U ratio changes.

By Eqe 3.5.6=17 then, DT behavior must closely follow that of U L
Fig. 3.5-2l shows that the lowest DT clearly occurs at a ThCl L/UC]'B

3.5.7.3 Effect on power density and flux levels

The power density limit of 10 Mi/liter (Section 3.2.2.2) reflects more
a premonition cf problems than a recognition of any specific. ones,
Still, flux levels in the core tubes and the pressure vessel closely
relate to power density (section 3.2.2.3). Figure 3.5-25 shows

how ThClA dilution of the care salt markedly reduces power density
and fluxes alike.

The skewed-tube geometry will further increase the critical mass
(lower the power density). A cylinder with length-to-diameter ratio
(/D) near 1.0 requires about 10% more critical mass in low density
metal sysiems than does a sphere; with L/D~2, about 40% more, The
heterogeneity of multiple skewed tubes further increases critical
mass as does neutran capture and scatter by the blanket ThClL in
between the tubes. Altogether these effects should reduce power
density and fluxes by more than a factor of two compared to spheres.
Aplied to Fig. 3.5-25, the result is that ThClL/UCl3 = 0.1 now

satisfies the power density criteria of < 10 iW/1.

At higher ThClh/UClB ratios the > 100 keV flux in the vessel

level will allow operation over the reactor life for many metals.

Meanwhile the core flux level will be «~--102'3 n cm-z mo—l.

Presumably, most materials won't be able to take many months of that.
This emphasizes the importance of our design: straight tubes, easily

replaced, and not touching one another.

3.5.10 Reactor Design: Core Carrier Salt (NaCl) Content

Like ThClL, NaCl substitution for UCl3 in the primary salt
significantly reduces the fissile inventory outside the core tubes,
but also degrades the neutronic performance in the core. This
section analyzes some of these physics conseguences assuming a core
salt composed of zero ThCl, and a 2333/234U ratio of 7. Results

are compared with those from ’I‘hClI+ substitution (Sece 3.5.9).

3.5.10.1 Effect on BG. NaCl decreases BG through parasitic abe
sorption and moderation of neutrons. Fig. 3.5-28 combines the results
from the present MCFR(Th) study with the behavior derived from an

MCFR(Fu) study by Taube. The results suggest

1, Generally minimizing the NaCl ccntent

2. Absolutely avoiding NaCl molar content 80%

Fig. 3.5=29 compares NaCi substitution relative to ThClh
substitution on an expanded scale. One sees that ThClh diminishes
BG slightly less than NaCl does. The probsble reason is that most
neutron capture in ThGlh contributes to BG (even considering the
four Cl atoms), whereas none of that in NaCl does. Table 3.5IX
supports thise.

With a thinner blanket, the ThClL

ably be much greater.

3.5.9.2, NaCl substitution for UCly increases the fissile inventory
in the core tubes within the vessel. However, the larger inventory
outside the vessel decreases faster. Thus the total inventory
(primary circuit plus blanket) decreases with increasing NaCl
content.

NaCl substitution also decreases the BG export rate, but only
clightly. Uniike ThClh substitution, NaCl substitution continues
to decrease DT down through 30% UCl3 melar content. However, beyond
that point Sec. 3.5.10.1 indicates that BG should fall off drastic-—

ally, with consequent DT increase.

3.5.10.3 Zffect cn power density and flux levels. Figure 3.531
shows how NaCl substituticn for UCl3 decreases the power density and
flux leyels. However, ThClA—substitution causes an even faster dee
crease. In both cases the blanket composition remains constant.

Thus the greater fall-off in flux from adding ThClh to the core salt

must stem from the higher microscopic absorption cross section for Th

than for Na (Table 3.5~X),resulting in less neutron leakage from the
core.
The difference that ThClL makes relative to NaCl might allow

the use of a thinner blanket.,

3.5.10.4 Effect on 233U/231‘U ratio. Substitution of non-fissile
salts for UCl3 softens the neutron spectrum because it substitutes
a source of elastic~ and inelastic- scattered neutrons for one of
fission neutrons. In a softer sﬁectrum, the rate of <My (thresh=

old) fission decreases and 233U (-1/v ) capture increases. Both

changes increase the ZBAU content. 233U capture increase also de-

creasesthe 233U content, giving a double effect. All three effects

work in coucert to decrease the ratic (Fig. 3.532).

Differences between NaCl and ThClh as salt substitutes appear
to be small. NaCl mostly scatters elastically while ThCll+ scatters
more inelastically. The different shapes of the NaCl and ThClh curves
in Fig..3.5-32 may reflect these differences: Th inelastic scatter

should contribute more to spectrum softening at low non-fissile con~

tent where the neutrons still exceed the inelastic threshold energy.

Combination or these faciors defines the toxicity of an isotope - just
how much of a practical threat it paces, Table 3,5XI includes a tox~
icity classification along with other pertinent physics information,
The moderate helf-lives of Pu plus their early preeminence in the act-
inide burnup chains warrant their highly toxic classification, Carcin-
ogenicity further emphasizes avoiding their.production,

The problem with (o(,n) reactions as well as spontaneous fission
neutrons is that neutrons penetrate gamma shielding: in addition +o
harming workers directly, they can activate the surroundings, presenting
longer-term hazards.

Yumerous light elements (up through Al and Si) underzo these re-
actions with alphas, Fige 3e5=33 shovws some relative yields, F,
though not included there reacts almost as strongly as Be., F, Li,
and Be are candidate materials for (blanket) salt mix; this phenom-
enon argues against their use unless the neutron sigmal and hazerd
are desired for non-proliferation pur-oses, Section 3.7 mentions the
use of Iy O, ligy 2nd a with various revrocessing schemes; <his
phenomenon would discourage their use there somewhat,

action (Fiz, 345-33) makes isotoves emitting higher—energy alphas part

To remove most of this zad other radiation one could chemicaliy
separate the uranium in the core sali{ I{rom the 208T1 and all other
actinides and fission productis, However, this would not separate 233U
from 232U. Then, in only fwo weeks the surface dose would again reach
1 Rem/hour. Purthermore, if only 99% removal efficiency was achieved,
2 3 Rem/hour surface dose from 208T1 alone would be present in the
interim,

From this one concludes that a highly efficient scientific group
with laboratory facilities (such 25 a national laboratory} might be
able to make a bomb without getting a deadly radiation dose, but all
others would encounter difficulty,

In addition to these complications, the tell-tale 208Tl signals
would continue to emanate from the separated waste as well as from the
new regenerating source in the separated U, All these froubles must
discourage subnational groups which contemplate taking and using 233U

3.5.12 Summary

Section 3.5 attempted a first cut at optimizing the reactor des
ign and compesition and also analyzed some of the consequences there-
from. The first six subsections defined methods, data, and models.

Sec. 3.5.7 discouraged the use of an inner blanket and showed
that two meters constitutes an infinite outer blanket, In that event
a reactor reflector contributes little., In addition to achieving
maximum BG, the 2 m=blanket greatly reduces the flux dose to the
reactor vessel., Sec. 3.5.7 also favored graphite as the core tube
wall material because Mo strongly absorbs neutrons.

Section 3.5.8 showed tnat design decisions which favor a high
233U/23£‘U ratio in the core salt produce

1. A hard neutron spectrum there

2. Higher BG and lower DT

3. Minimal presence of Pu and other high-A actinides
Fortunately, within the ranges of interest, all the trade studies
indicate that the 233U/ZBI*U ratio on equilibrium fuel cycle will
exceed 7. That is sufficiently high to achieve the above goals;
additional major efforts are unwarranted.

.Sections 3459 and 3.5.10 revealed that both ThClh and NaCl,
acting as diluents in the core salt, greatly reduce flux levels and
the amount of out~of-core fissile inventory. They also reduce BG.
The combined effects of inventory and BG produce an optimum DT near
a U molar composition of about 30% and a Th/U ratio of 1=2. This

and the lower flux levels explain the preference of other MCFR

308
 

studies for a fissile molar content of 15=30 %. However, low fissile
content will decrease ther233U/23AU ratio, an indication of greater

transplutenium buildup. Thus the true optimum remains to be found

and will depend on final assignment of priorities.

DT of 20-30 years appear feasible, This is high compared to
quoted DT 13-20 years for an MSBR on the Th fuel cycle. However,
an MCFR(Th) should build up less transplutonium.

Efforts to lower DT should focus on the out=of-core inventary.
Note also, that, compared teo conventional reactors, the absence of
fuel fabrication and decladding operations and the minimal trans-
portation and storage needs provide additional fuel inventory ad-
vantages which are not taken into account here.

Section 3.5.11.1 quantified somewhat the basis for avoiding
transplutonium buildup. Sece 3.5.11.2 pinpointed fresh blanket U
as the greatest proliferation hazard. By immediately mixing it with
core salt, one adds not only fission product activity, which is
chemically removable, but also 232U—daughter radiocactivity which
is not. The radioactivity will discourage U handling, but not make
it impossible. Sec. 3.5.11.3 showed that the presence of too much

FP can sericusly redace BG.

ative salt density coefficient of -=0.03 Ak/k/ A/a//o for their

low-actinide fluoride salt mix.

3.6.2.1 Reactor startup. MCFR coolant circuits and salt supply will

need preheating just like an lSBR does, A salt of subcritical fuel

sequent rise to power by gradually adding fissile fuel through the

3.6.2.2 Reactor control, A iimited study [29] indicated feasible

of a solid-fuel reactor allow this direct respcnse.

3.6.2.3 Reactor stability and inventory ratio. The amount of fuel
in the primary circuit outside the core fixes the effective delayed

- 3.6,3 Analysis of Accident Situations

Cantinual removal of velatile fission products frem the salts
during cperation eliminates several obnoxicus species fram being
present in an accident. Yany of the remaining hazards would stay
in the salt. Thus, no accident can occur which corresvonds in se-
verity of radiocactivity to the meltdowm of solid fuel systems. The
major concern then becomes that no primary circuit failure lead to

critical masses formirg.

3.6.3.1 Small leakages. Leaks bstween core snd blanket pose ne
sericus chemical threat as the salts are compatible. However, other
factors influence whether ti2 pressure difference should force

core salt leaks into the blenket or vice versa,

Higher temperatures in the core salt may produce higher wvapor
pressures there then in the blanket. The core salt also circulates
under pump pressure vwhile the blanket salt need not. If a reserve
tank autcmatically replaced fuel salt leaking into the blanket, the
system could simultanecusly approach supercriticality and high
temperature, a strong temperature coefficient not withstanding. The
high temperature could further abet the detericration. 1In contrast,
blanket salt leaking into the core would anly dampen the criticalitys:
hovever, this could result in degraded system performance.

An anomalous rise in concentration of 233U or fission product
in the blanket, or a rise in temperature there (due to increased
fissions), ar a drop in core salt pressure would sigmal core-to-
blanket leakoge. Leakage of blanket salt into the core would decrease

the core mean temperature and blanket salt pressure.

318
The secondary coolant circuit should be pressurized slightly
higher above the primary one, and the tertiary even nigher. This
will cause less active coolants like helium or lead te leak into
the molten salt. He 1s inert and the salt cleanup system, which
aiready separates the fission product gases, would remove helium
as well. Lead interacts with nickel-bearing allcys, but not with
i{o cr graphite. Traps at certain points in the cirecuit wyculd iocate
the positicn of .ead .eaxage.

The ccntainment building will catch leakage cf volatile fission
products from the primary cirauit or btlarnket tc the air, simiiar
to MSRZ, with zppropriate detection and leaktight barriers, |
3.6.3.2 Loss of flow. Leaks, pipe break, heat exchanger plugging,
and pump failure can all reduce flow in the primary circuit. Figure
3.6=3 analyzes the consequences. In most events the reactar shuts
down and the fuel drains to a safety tank; th=re fission product
decay and-delayed neutron-induced fission continue to generale
heat, but the high capacity of the salt restrains the temperature
rise, -

The effect of a single pump failure depends upen the primary
circuit arrangement. With single punps per channel (Pian A in Fig.
3.2~8) failure of cne pump would shut down one whole core channel.
The fuel sait in that core chanrel must then drain out to stop full
pover production im it. Subsequent replacement by void, blanket; or
carrier salt would cause a large loss of reactivity thereby shutting
down the reactor unless

individually near criﬁical, and
(2) Missing reactivity could be added through enrichment
enhancement
Then one could continue operation on a reduced scale, e.z. 6/7 for
six out of seven channels still operating, until a more opportune
time occurred in which to drain the whole core and replace mal-
functianing equipnment.

With multiple subchannels per core channel, each with pumps
and exchangers as in Fig. 3.2-8-B, C and D, failure of one pump
still allows partial reactor operation until a better time for shut-—
down and repair. If cne operated the Plan B or C subchannels or |
the plan D heat exchanger at less than full efficiency, then their
full use is available in the event of one subchannel failure. This
would however, increase out=cf=core inventory and capital costs
though., Should the core tubes be connected in series as in Secticn
3.2.6.4 then any in~core malfunction (leak or pipe break) would
require system shutdown.

Should both regular and emergency power supply fail, all
pumps would fail unless they are steam turbine driven. However,
electrically driven pumps are easier to include in the containment
and also easier to supply for pre-testing, etce Inertia would
help electric pump run—down rates, or same short~term auxiliary
supply might have to be provided until full dump of fuel has takenr
place. The fluid could also drain through a "freeze wvalve" by
gravity into a natural—convection cooled tank which has a non-
critical geomeiry.

In the event that flow ceases and core salt remains in place,

321
the strong negative temperature coefficient will control the temp-
erature and power: initial temperature increase will decrease
density, which decreases reactivity and thereby power, until some
equilibrium state is reached. HCFR(Pu) studies [29] with a simpli=
fied reactor model showed that the temperature rise of the salt for a
reactivity step of up to $1 should be less than BOOOC; for 7 pumps
failing out of 8, less than 230°C.

In summary, it appears that reactor stability concern over
out-of—core inventory may oreclude the use of cut~of-core subchannels
as well as Aictate series ccnnecticn of the core chamnels. This
means designing the system fer high reliability to minimize shut-
dosm and for rapid repair of heat exchangers, piping, and pumps
wnen shutdown does occur. Rapid repair will entail expedient removal
of all the core salt followed by a salt flushing of all radiocactivity
from the system. The strang temperature coefficient should disspell

any criticality accident concerns.

322
3.6.3.3 Structural failure. Failure of the tubes separating core
and blanket would lead to no chemical or cempatibility problems.
Dilution of the core salt will reduce reactivity; anly if core salt
were replenished as it entered and displaced the blanket, could a
reactivity increase occur. Even then the system could accomodate
temperature rise from moderate salt additions, as ample margin
exists abecve cperating temperature on a short term basis. The
limit to the permissible rate of such salt addition needs to be
established.

Vessel failure would reguire rapid dumping from both the
circuit and the catchpots. Dump tanks should probably be sized
to centain the cantents of cne secondary coolant circuit as well
as all core and blanket salt. Relief valves on the secondary
system will protect the primary circuit from pressurizaticn result-
ing from a major steam generator failure into the secandary system.

In the event of a major circuit failure, operating pressure
would play an important role in the subsequent fate of the fissicn
products and the containment, The molten salts themselves ex-
hibit low vapor pressures. Although high pumping losses can cause
primary circuit pressures up to 460 psi, lead secondary coolant
acts essentially like a hydraulic system with little stcred energy.
Missile formation is therefore unlikely and it should be possible
to demonstrate a containment which will not be breached from this

Cause .

323
 

With a high-pressure helium—cooled system one must ask whether
an accident might aerosolize the core salt. However, a properly=-
designed reactor vessel could withstand the full helium pressure from
a severe rupture between the coolant and primary circuits. Thus
release of activity te the reactor containment cell would not occur
except under a simultonecus double failure. The cell itself is
small and can economically be made in the form of a prestressed
vessel to withstand missile damage and to act as an additional
barrier to fission product release. A final low pressure building
cantainment would prevent release from smell leaks in the earlier

centainment stages.

3.6.3.L Emergency cooling. Unlike solid fuel, molten salt can quickly
transfer into a geometrically-safe tank. Cravity can provide a
failsafe transfer method from reactor to holding tank (Figure 3.2-11):
a pipe wherein the salt is normally kept frozen weould open naturally
upcn loss of electric power.

In the tank, the salt will circulate naturally as heat from
fission product decay transfers through tube walls to air convected
by natural draft towers. Ctherwise pressure would build up from salt
vaporization. The absence of mechanical moving parts will make this
whole system hizhly reliable; multiplicity could add even further in-
tegrity. A forced draft system would probably layout more compactly

324
 

A second cooling option would circulzte naturally a low melting-
point salt or NaK through U-tuves in the tank to boiling water heat
excnangers, Air-cooled condensers situated in a2 normel or forced draft
stack would condense *he steam formed, Alternatively, the heat could
transfer directly to a large boiling pool, thus accomodating decay heat
for a protracted period without makeupe. Condensers or make-up water
would be provided for coniinuous operation,

A catchall salt bed below this apparatus would serve as a backup
for any leaks or breaks, The heat of salt{ formation would greatly
2id in absorbing decay energy. An independent cooling system might
remove decay heat. The bed wowld alsec dilute the fuel salt., Proper
choice of tank diameter would insure subcriticalitye.

Recovery from emergency tanks or beds would require heaters,
drains, and pumps. When carrier or blanket salt is added for dilu~
tion and/or heat absorption by latent heat of formation, a method

tc separate out the dump salt would z2lso be needed,

325
 

3.6.3.5 Comparison of MSRs to others. WMSRs should be biologically
safer because

l. The plant continuously removes velatile fission products

2. The fuel is already molten and in contact with materials

designed for that candition.

The removal of volatiles fram the primary circuit still requires
attention to their presence elsewhere in the plant. However, it
should not be difficult to insure the integrity of a storage medium
below ground. After a suitable decay period scme of the gases may be
releasable to the atmosphere.

In the event a pump fails or other flow loss occurs, ths enly
concern is that decay heat right build up vaporization pressure,
However, the same colls which preheat the fluid could also cool the

fluid.

3.6.3.6. Precipitaticn out of eutectic mixtures. After the temperature
cof a salt mixture falls to the solidification point, the compositiom
of liquid changes, sliding alang the liquidus curve as crystals
separate out (Figure 3.6-4). With low initial UCly molar centent,
cooling precipitates out NaCl crystals, thereby enriching the fluid

in UClB. With high initial UCl3 molar content, cooling produces UCl3
crystals and NaCl-enriched fluid. In either case the liquid migrates
to the nearest eutectic point (nadir) composition and causes a concenw
tration of UClB. Thus one must consider possible criticality situ-
ations and design geometries to prevent them, Probably precipitation

of UCl3 crystals from a UClB-rich fluid is the less-serioﬁs case,

3,6.,3.,7 BRBoiling off cf salt mixtures. In the event that the carrier
salt had a boiling point much lower than that of the actinide chlorides,
one could postulate a positive temperature coefficient contribution in
that temperature region. Fortunately evidence from section 53.3.3.5

contradicts this: carrier salts appear to be less volatile than

actinide chlorides.

327
3,6,3,8 Containment. Solid fuel plants generally feature triple
containment: fuel element, reactor vessel, and tha:n the contain-
ment building. The MCFR will feature reduced FP radiocactivity due
to continuous gas cleanup but it will inherently have only double
containment of piping and 2 building. A second radiation hazard
arises from activation of the secondary coolant and nearby equipment
by delayed nevirons in the primary circuit.

To further ceontain these harzards, a low-pressure leak-tight
membrane might be formed arcund the walls, floors and ceiling of
the reactor system. This membrane can also form part of the duct-
ing for the inert gas circuiaticn required to cool the concrete
structure and shielding and inhibit vessel oxidation. Heat losses
with insulation restricting the concrete temperatures to below 7OGC
would be about 200 watts/m2 with 40 ¢m of insulation. This would
equate to about 3 M{ total heat removal by water or air cooling.

The main building would constitute the tertiary containment.
Its volume must be sufficient to contain the stored emergy of any
gases present. In the lead-cooled design these are cover gas vol-
umes al low to moderate pressure. The helium—cooled version may
require a larger outer containment volume and/or intermediate pre-

stressed concrete containment(Sec. 3.6.3.3)

3,6.3.9 Resistance to external threat. Cne can postulate a number
of scenarios wherein external explosion or impact threatens th=
reactor integrity directly or through a loss—of-coolant accident.
These could involve ground or aerial bombs, planes, and space re-
entry projectiles (e.g. meteors, missiles, space laboratory), by

either accident or intention. An individual, a subnaticnal group,

328
 

or another country might intentionally initiate, Nature threatens
with earthquakes, tornadoes, and dam breaks.

In many or most of thase situations one could anticipate the
danger. Most reactors already lie below ground level. Still the
vessels generally sit high enough to be rupture~prone to strong
explosions cr impacts. Such an incident could release volatized
fission products and actinides of_consequence greatly exceeding
a simple bomb cr other initiating event.

To protect against these threats an MCFR could uniquely trans-
fer its fuel to a storage tank (section 3.6.3.3), located remotely

under additicnal earth (Figure 3.6-~5) or in an otherwise hardened

"sunker".

This section analyzes the chemical aspects of {the reactor fuel
cycle: principelly vreparation of the ThCl4 blanket fuel and repro-
cessing of irradiated blanket and core salts,

Some processing should occur continously, some batchwise, Ratch-
wise will generally be easier, more efficient in separation, and more
economical, This study does not deal witk the near-identical concerns
associated with starting early cores up with PuCl3 or 235UCl instead

ThO2 is converted to ThClh, mixed with reprocessed blanket
salt, and fed into the blanket simultaneous with blanket salt
removal. Blanket reprocessing separates out bred'UClh(pre-
dominantly ;233U01h},reduces it to UCL,, and admixes that to
reprocessed core salt, forming the core shim material., This
constitutes a spiked fuel, suitable for BG export as well as
for positive reactivity shim to the MIFR(Th) core (simultaneous
with irradiated core salt removal).

Core salt reprocessing removes fission products, oxides,
corrosion products, and chlorine iransmutation productsj part
continuously and part batchwise. It alsoc readjusts the chlorine
stoichiometry.

3.7.1 Principal Salt Reprocessing Methods

The MSR ccnicept inherently aveids many of the conventicnal
reprocessing stages, especially fuel element dissolution and
refabrication. The absence of these stages removes the need for

high decontamination stages in reprocessing. Proliferation ccncerns

330
 

also discourage high decontamination: residual radioactivity

makes weapcn construction hazardous. Eliminating ail these stages

racucss costs.,

This leaves just the separation stages: core sali cleanup and

bred-U extraction frem the blanket. The most promising methods are by

l. Solvent extracticn from aqueous soluticn
2. Volatility

3. Pyrcmetallurgy

L. Pyrochemistry (molien salt electrolysis)

e first review the chemistry of the heavy elements.

3.7.1.1 Chemistry of the heivv elements[31], The separation
processes, especially those based on solvent extiraction, take ad-
vantage of the scmewhat unusual chemical behavier of the actinides.
Elements in the analcgous lanthanide series all exhibit similar

chemistry: +the presence of three, relatively loosely-bound, outer

electrons causes each atom to exhibit 2 positive valence of 3,

The actinides also all form a tripositive (III) valence
state. However, some also evidence loosely-bound inner elec-
trens. This leads to tetrapositive (IV}, pentapositive (V),
and hexapositive (VI) states.

Tnese higher oxidation states evidence different stabilities
(table 3.7-I1) which facilitates extraction and separation of the
heavy elements. Th and U differ proncuncedly, Th evidencing

mostly just the IV state.

The IIT and IV states easily preeipitate from aquecus soluticn
as flucrides; the V or VI states do not. The fluorides of the
IIT and IV states do not volatilize; the VI-state fluorides do
at fairly low temperatures. The IV and VI states appreciably
dissolve in certain organic liquids; the III-state nitrates remain
virtually insoluble in these liquids.
3.7.1.2 Solvent extracticn from agueous solution. The extractiaon
o; actinides from aquecus sclution by an organic solvent is the
most advanced process: it has been widely used since about 1951.
The Thorex version extracts 233U from aqueous soluticn of irradiated

1n fuel elements [72}. It relies on the stability differences

332
 

between Th and U in higher valence states (Table 3.7-1).
The facility of solvent extracticon for multi-stage operaticn

without consuming additional heat or chemicals particularly benefits

1. Situations requiring extreme purification, Use of enough
stages can lower the gamma activity from fission products
in the extracted urznium tc belcw that of naturai uranium.
Thus cne might not want to furnish this capapility tc a
foreign naticon.

2. Situaticns where th:s propertiies of two metals parallel
one anicther sc clcsely that a single precipitaticn or
crystallizaticn can not separate to the degree required.
Thus this method may not be needed for Th-U separation.

The dissoluticen step for a chloride salt has to be the simplest
of all: Just add water. Different organic sclvenis separately
extract the U, Th, and wastes. Addition of 012 and CCLL subsequentliy
rechloridizes U and Th.

Disadvantages associated with this method include

l. Extra criticality precautions fer H-mederated fusl soluticns

2. Multipliciiy and complexity of steps

3. Large waste volumes

I, Large shielded space required

5. Additional steps needed to produce solid wastes.
3.7.1.3 Velatility orocesses. Volatile UF (b.p. 56.AOC) easily
separates from fission product and Th fluorides. The‘ability to de-
contaminate to low activiiy levels parallels that for solvent evirzc—.

tion, However, the volatility method requires fewer steps and therefore

333
smaller volumes of highly-radicactive wastes compared with aquecus
pProcessinge.

Volatilization should work especially well for processing a
ThFh/%aF (cr other fluoride carrier) blanket salt mix. Cne would

cxidize +he bred UFL to UFy, separate it by distillation, chloridize

4

it, and reduce it to UClL,. The remaining ThF

1 would return to the

blanket.

Distilling UClh, UCls, or UCl, from a mix of ThClb and chlorides
of the structural materials and fissicn products would be more diffiw
cult: more volatile chloridss compounds exist and their vapor-pres-
sure ranges overlap, Howev:zr, considerzble less develooment effor<

has been expended on method:s for separating volatile chlorides; the

problems may be solvable,

3:7.1,5 Pyrometallurgical processing. In the 1950's ANL developed
pyrometallurgical processes to recover and purify fissile and fertile
material from breeder reactors. Although demcnstrated cn a pilot-
plant scale, much engineering development remained to evolve a
workable and reliable process, especially in ﬁiew of criticality
restrictions.

A typical process would use a molten chloride flux to contact
the oxide fuel and a molten metal to extract the actinide. Hence the
need for high temperature (pyro). With molten chloride salt fuels
anly the extractant is needed: for chloride fuels, Dillon [28]
proposed a Mg-Zn alloy. A similar metal may work with Th/U cycle
chlorides.

Pyrometallurgical processes decontaminate by factors of only

334
about one hundred. With them one must handle fuel remotely. This
poses no problem for molten salt processing: it requires no fuel
fabrication or other handling; everything is dcne remotely anyhow.
Leaving in racicactivity also inhibits use of the material for
Weapans.

Because of its compactness, pyrometallurgical process can operate
ciose-coupled to the reacter and cn a muich shorter cycle than the
acuecus rcute. If econcmical, a pyrochemical processing plant could
easily be acccmodated within the reactor building due to its small
size., Preliminary work indicates that capital and operating costs
may be high because of the small batch type operaticns needed.

Detracticns include lcw recovery rates and the development

needed to cope with temperatures zbove TOOOOC. High temperature

€quipment of great reliability that can be operated and replaced
remotely 1s hard to design and expensive to test. However, work

already done indicates that the difficulties may be overcome.

3.7.1.5 Molten salt electrolysis. Techniques exist to deposit
actinide oxides and carbides from molten =alt sclution through

at the cathode. At ths anode:

2C1" (soln) === Cl;(gas) + 2e”
Similarly Taube [147] mentioned reducing actinides directly in their
melten chloride mixture. The Cl, released could be used to chloridize

ThC, for blanket feed (section 3.7.7).

3.7.2 Core Salt Processing

Cn equilibrium cycle, the core fuel will include carrier alkali
salt (e.g. NaCl), fissile UC13, diluent ThClh, actinide transmutants
(e.g. PaClL, NpClB, and PuC;B), impurity oxides, fission products in
various forms and states (section 3.4.2.1), structural cerrosion
products, and sﬁfn { from chlorine transmutation)}. Some of the
mutants may fcrm éomplex chlorides like 052U016 angd compounds like
UI and US, which precipitate out at sundry temperatures.

Core shim material rmust replace irradiated core salt near-
ccntinuously so as to maintain criticality. The fuel burnup rate’
(1.6 gm/min for a 2250 }fth plant) fixes the rate of shim replacement.
Actual core salt reprocessing can still occur batchwise or continuously.
The choice will depend in part on the allowable inventory of core salt
in reprocessing and the allowable level of FP concentrations in the
core. The latter depends an
1. The reactivity worth of FP
2. The effect of lower Th/U ratio or increased reactor size
an reactor performance.

3« The effect of ¥P on BG

L« Acceptable radicactivity levels in the primary circuit
(high levels necessitate remote reprocessing and extra

plant shielding).

336
 

3.7.2.1 BRecovery options. The first option is whether to clean up
the salt (remove the bad part) or just recover the 233UCl3 and scrap
the rest since lNaCl is so cheap. Solid fuel cycles conventionally
take the latter approach. Here we choose to clean up the salt because
1. NaCl radiocactivity precludes easy disposal
2. Znrichment in 37Cl(if chosen) would forfeit cheap cost
arguments
3. Discarding non-uranium actinides would mean poor fuel
utilization since every actinide atom can eventually
fission in this spectrum
L. Continuous gas removal gives a gocd start on salt cleanup.
It might be feasible to just remove the parasitic neutron ab—
sorbers and corrcsion agents: let the salt accumulate the rest of
the mostly-radioactive non-volatile mutants,some as substitute
carrier salt. The acdvantages are
1. A suitable place to store non-volatile radioactive wastes
2. The reactor will transmute many of the wastes into a less
hazardous form.
3. The radiocactivity will add to the heat source.
L4, The radicactivity discourages diversion of the core salt
for weapans purposes.
Pctential disadvantages to watch for and control are
1. Change in viscosity and other thermophysical properties
2, DlMutant plate-ocut causing flow blockage, radiation sources,
or other problems.
The enumerated advantages seem real enough to warrant this

basic approach; practicalities may require some modifications,

337
3.,7.2.2 Continuous removal of mutant gases. Fission produces Se,
Xe, Kr, I,, and Bry, which are all gases at reactor temperatures
(section 3.4.2.1). Threshold reacticons élso produce He and HT gas.
Cne toa of fuel from the core of a fast breeder contains 2 x IOA Ci
ot 8%z 100 0i of Be (after cooling 4 gonths), 130 and 0.7 Ci
of LBl (after cooling 4 and 6 months, respectively), 0.13 Ci

1291, and 2200 Ci of T. In an MSR circuit rupture, these weculd

of
all present a radiation hazard. Gas accumulation will also build
up pressure, affecting circulation,

In remedy for the MSBR,CENL proposed a cleanup system which
recirculates gas in lcops across each main salt pump. Injected
helium nucleates bubbles which absorb gases, the small-particle
fog of inert metals (Pd, Tc,Ru,Rh, and Te) and some of the volatile’
chlorides (Fig. 3.7~1). “hile in a hold-up tank to reduce decay
heat, some of the metals and chlorides deposi£ out. Passage through
traps and beds removes Kr, Xe, water, etc., before returning to the
helium injector. About 20% of the bypass flow undergoes a long delay
in which all isotopes except the 1(-year 85Kr decay to an insignificant
level.

Presently 85Kr levels from reactors are small encugh to discharge
directly to the atmospherc. Should nuclear power abound in 30-40
years it may be necessary to separate out 85K; low=temperature
fractionation looks like a promising method.

Eveporation and fractionation can also concentrate tritium for

lengthy storage; this is presently done in solid fuel reprocessing.

Section 3.7.1 mentions three possible rrocessing methods,

location, would mean

1. Increased out-of-plant inventory

2. Increased nazard of radiocactivity, sabotage, and pro=

liferation

compounds react with UCl; to precipitate uranium o des and oxy-
chlorides. Oxygen can enter the salt through air, water vapor cr
transmutation of F. The vagaricus nature of air and water vapor
entry necessitates keeping the oxygen content well below saturation.
A continuous gas bubbling system (with chemical reducing agent)
should help: so should the appreciable capacity of the salt for
OXygen.

Experiment indicates difficulty with simple methods of salt
cleanup such as the small change in sclubility by temperature
adjustment.. An alternative effective methed routes the bypass
gas flow through a bed, vhere the gas mixes continucusly with
injected liquid NaAlClh. Greater stapility of A1203 causes it
to form over AlCl3 (Fig. 3.7-3). The .solid alumina then separates

out by filtraticn or cyclaone.

3e7e2sH Removal of sulfur impurities, Several nuclear reactions
convert chlorine to sulfur (Figure 3.7;4). Mass balance and Coulonmb
barriers combine to inhibit most of these reactions; but high flux
levels bolster production, 3501 converts to 325, 335, and 365. 3731
should produce only small amounts of 348 (favoring 2 3701 enrichment
2gain), A natural chlorine-fuelled system will produce more sulfur
than the salt solubility can handle, Phosghorus, though present is
only transitory, decaying quicily to suliur,

The presence of sulfur, or of any other element capable of
compounding with uranium, need not adversely affect the feasibil-
ity of the system: simple zdjustment of temperature and UCl]+ |
content can induce precipitztion in a clean-up circuii. Because
one can reliably predict the production rate of these mutants,
the concentrations in the core could be safely maintained close
to saturation: then even an inefficient removal process would
suffice.

The effect of the sulfur presence will, in part, depend on its
oxidation state. For molten sulfur, the oxidation-state equi-
librium is fairly well fixed; the predominant state tends to be‘
positive (Fig. 3.7-5). The "positivity" also increases with
irrediation (Fig. 3.7-6).

hold up 233Pa. Also an MCFR produces magnitudes—less tritium,

3.7.3 Blanket Salt Processing

Blanket salt processing must extract UClh and convert it
to UClB. Some degree of separation may be initially accomplish-
ed by slowly cooling the salt mix to precipitate out ThC'Ll.l+
until a eutectic composition is reached (Fig. 3.6-1).

A low need for high purity plus a desire for compactness
favor pyroprocessing with chlorides. Should the blanket salt
be a fluoride, oxidation to UFy and subsequent distillation
(section 3.7.3.8) appeals.

UClh reduces to UCl3 reilatively easy using HZ' alkali
(Na,K,etc.), U, or The For metallic reduction, rod, gauze
or turnings are popular. Using alkali (ik = Na or K), the
chemical reaction is

UClh + Ak ——i U013 + AkCL
This results in a 50/50 molar mix; lower in uranium content
than desired. Any AkCl initially present would even further
reduce the UCl3 molar content. This leaves culy Th or H2
as alternatives.

Th metal is toxic and flammable. H, produces HCl, which in
turn might be used to chlorinate the thorium oxide feed (section
3.7+7)s A possible direct route to reducing UClk.may;be by
electrolyéis, releasing 012 which could, in turn, chlorinate ThO

feed.

343
 

Blanket salt should well accord batch reprocessing. The frequency
of blanket reprocessing will depend on
1. The tolerable 233U coancentration in the blanket which de~
pends on
da« Allowable power production in blanket which depends on
(1) Maximum desirable heat removal capability from
blanket salt
(2) Neutron damage to reactar vessel
b. The amount of 233U inver:tory to be tolerated in the
blanket, which depends on
(1) Proliferation hazard
(2) Financial worth of <oy
c. The loss in BG it causes
2. The optimum reprocessing economics which depends on
ae 233U separation efficiency
b. Blanket reprocessing costs
3. The demand rate for 233U in the core shim tank which depends
on
a. The tolerable size of the shim tank, which depends on

nificant BG loss as the Pu/ZBBU ratio went from 10 to 10°<. An

3.7.5 Fuel Cycle Summary

Fig. 3.7-9 summarizes a typical MCFR(Th) fuel cycle. On equi-

librium cycle an MCFR(Th) blanket consumes natural thorium and breeds

233UClh . Blanket reprocessing separates out the UClh, reduces it

to UClB’

and feeds it into the core as shim. Small anounts of Th,

23L‘U, and.232U also carry over in chloride form.

Renovated core salt still highly radioactive, mixed in

weapcns-grade mix returns to the core, but some goes cut

as BG in a form non-conducive to intimate handling.

Section 2.5.2 advocates minimum transport of weapons-grade

and radioactive material. The one shipment of starter fuel in

and shipment of EG out constitutes the only major transport, nil

compared to the usual reactor fuel cycle.

352
 

3.8 Safeguards

3.5.1 llational Fuel Inventory

Although cut—of-core cooiing greatly increases the fuel in-—
ventory in the primary circuit, fuel safeguards does not suffer:

l. Fuel diversion from the primary c¢ircuit requires shut-

ting down the operating power plant

<. High radicactivity makes diversicn unwieldy.

The inventory in the reprccessing stream will depend cn the
reprocessing mode (batchwise vs. cantinuous) and on the reprocessing
coals (degree of separations., The only other fuel accumulaticns
will be in ths shim tank ancd in the breeding gain experi, both
highiy radiocactive.

The absence of fuel febrication and fuel elemené reprecessing,
and associated_trahéportation eliminates most out~of-plant inven-
tory. Thus, unlike other reactor fuel cycles, the national in-
ventory of an MCFR basically comprises only the power plant inven-—

tories.
3.8.2 In—-plznt Diversicn Potential

FP and 232U-daughter radicactiviiy in the molten fuel should
discourage diversion prior to reprocessing. Selective reprocessing
could remove just the neutron absorbars and corrosive agents,
while allowing high—-activity non—voiatile emitters to remain.

(This would simultaneously manage some of the cumberscme waste).
After appreciable reactcr cperaticn, long-term radicactivity and heat

generation retes may prohibit salt use for ieapons.

353
The most sensitive (weapons-attractive) material should be the
low=burnup UCl3 or UCl4 extracted from the blanket., Processing re-
motely and then mixing immediately with (reprocessed) radicactive
core salt should safeguard the UClB' Lo stage should ever hold
encugh low=burnup 233UCl3 to werrant seizure for quick bomb

manufzcture.

Je8.3 Facility cdificaticon

Presumably a country cculd modify its MCFm(Th) to produce Pu
by simply substituting UClAL fer ThClh in the blanket. This could
te dene either in the salt scoution or in a separate capsule.

But then a research reactor c¢- other neutrcn sources would serve
2lmecst as well. Thus safeguards cannot prohibit such‘steps: they
can only seek to induce ramifications to, and external sigrals of,
such modification. Signals would include higher heat production
in the blanket and fewer 2.56-iieV photons from 232 daughters.
Designing a blanket with limited heat remcval capability should

preclude significant Pu manufacture.
3.8.L, Desired Radicactivity in Transported Sreeding Gain

The best opportunities for diversion or theft of core salt
would oceur with stockpiles and transports of breeding gain. Still
even though the fuel be packaged for safe handling in transport,
the presence ox 232U daughters and radioactive fission products in
the Tuel will make it unatiractive for handling in weapcns con-
struction. Furthermore, this radicactivity will necessitate un-

wieldy shieldinz during transport. 7he subject radioisotopes should

3%
 

1. Have low neutron cross secticn to avoid neutronics penélty

2. Be nan-volatile so as to not pose a hazard in a transpcrt
accident

3. Be difficult to separate from the core salt.

Troublescme long=lived fission products might be ideal.

3.5.5 Hadiclorical Sabotaze Threat

Fission reactors inherently induce high levels of radioactivity.
A terrorist could deliberately release radiocactive gases and, by
means of explosive devices, radiocactive aercscols. Although an
M3E piant centinucusly purgec its fuel, much of the problem re—
mains: the same amcunt of fission products have still been gen-
erated per l/e and must eventually be disposed of (transported
from in-plant safe storage to some final safe stcrage). Cnly
semipermanent storage at the MSR site can alleviate.the transpor-
tation risk relative to other reactors. But even then, such a
high fission product concentration might alsc attract saboteurs.

In cantrast, a fusiom reactor produces only tritium which is
conceivabiy dispersable. In-plant recyeling further mitigates the
prcblem. However, the only near-term economical fusion reactor is
projected to be the hybrid which will produce weapans-grade fissile

fuel again.

355
 

3.9 Access and Maintenance

The geals fer all nuclear power plants include efficient,
reliable, and safe reactor operation. This entails adeguate
inspecticn and opportunity for maintenance and repair. iith lMSREs
one can drain the fuel, flush the system with clean salt, and then
replace the whole reactor vessel or individual heat exchanger
tnits. However, with out-of-core cooling, the primary circuit
emits delayed neutrens; these activate circuit equipment and the

secondary coolant, inhibiting access and maintenance there.
3.9.1 Ccmpzztress of an [“CrA

Figure 3.%1 indicates the compact laycut cf an MCFR and
compares its cverzll size to that for a typical L:FBR and a
lower-powered MSPR. In British HCFR{Pu) designs, no item of
plant exceeds 6.5 m diameter; this permits prefabrication of the
vessel in the shop, thus reducing construction time and interest

charges.
3.9.2 Intrinsic Feliability

The MSR avoids intricate mechanical devices: it needs

1. Mo complex refueliing mechanisms

2. Tew of the clcse tolerances present in solid=-fuelled re-
actors

3. Mo mechanicai control devices in the core or blanket.

This implies the high system reliability of a chemical or hydraulic

356
plant: pumps, heat exchangers, and containing materials will cperate
reliably so lcng as they do not exczed proven limits of corrcsicn,

thermal expansion, and salt velccity.

3,9.3 MS3EZ Ixoperience

MSRT demonstrated that with proper design crne can maintain an
active fluid-fuel system without undu: difficulty. Such design
should entail easy replacement of pump and heat exchanger or in-
situ repair. As an example, a U-tube heat exchanger allows the
major components to expand and zlsc permits plugging any leaking
tubes from the less—active coolant circuit side. These features

do cost some extra fuel inventory though.

3.9.4 Comparisen cf Primary Circuit Cenfigurations

In nuclear reactors radiation inhibits access to the primary cir-
cuit., The liquid nature of MCFR fuel allows the removal of most
of the radiation sources during reactor shutdown.

Cne would like to design the primary circuit ﬁo allow reduced—
power operaticon while repairing a small ex=—core portion of it in a
shielded cell (Fig. 3.9=2). Then removal of cne ™tube" circuit from
operation would still leave (p-1)/n of the reactor in cperation. Ad-
versely the primary circuit must lie close to the core so as to min-

imize out-of-core fuel tnventory.

357
 

Because of this the radiation fields of {he core and adjacent sub-
channels overlap, Therefore unless robots can do the job, replacement
or repair of any component (heat exchangers, pump, piping, etc.) will
probably require removal of all the radiation sources: 1i.e,, shut
down and clean out of the whole reactor,

In that event one might ask, are multiple loops in each sub-
channel still needed? Probably they still buy you time to wait until
a scheduled maintenance period occurs = like that for reolacing the

3.9.5 Reactor Maintenance/ﬁeplacement Procedure

Upon shutdown the core fluid may drain or be pumped into safe
gecmetlry tanks. Cperators could then flush the primary circuits,
first with (i_rradiated) blanket salt and then with fresh blanket
mix. The latter might first cleaﬂ‘up tine blanket region
itself. Zach mix would need a separate drain tank. Both tanks
and iines might require awdliary heating. ‘fater or steam couid

Jith a clean system, operators could dzcouple and replace the
grapiiite tubes just like fuel elements, only much faster:

2. Low radicactivity gr=2atly eases tne handling prcblems

3. Spent tubes will require no extensive storage as for spent

fuel elements; they should be easily disvosed of, |

L. Cnly a feuw (N=3-6) tubes are involved.

Core tubes will preobably require the most frequent replace-
ment of all the solid reactor components due to the combined effects
of radiation, corrosion, and high temperature. Frequency of re-
placement might be similar to that for LR and LIiFBR refuelling
(6-12 mos). Even more frequent intervals can be tolerated without
significant penalty. The costs of replacement tubes will be neg-
ligible alsc. C(ne would like to remove the tubes without dis—
turbing the reactor vessel. Cnce in a great while, the reactor

vessel or a graphite vessel liner could also be replaced,

fluxes of the order 10

This flux level could appreciably activate the primary circuit
environment, causing delay end difficulty in maintenance. Routing
cltiernate subchannels through separate shielded cells outside the
vessel (Fig. 3.7=1) would partly circumvent the problem: then if
one scbchannel broke down, the operitor could divert flow to another.
After a suitable decay time the broken subcircuit could be entered
and fixed.

The delayed neutron radiztion stems from relatively short-lived
emitiers; it will quickly stop once reactor operation does. The high
gamma radiation from fission and activation products lasts much

longer: it will continue during shutdown. Continuous fission

product cleanup helps to keep these gamma radiation levels down.
3.9.7 Radiation Sources in Reprocessing Equipment

Section 3.5.10.1 reported the neutron production from decay
alphas. To avoid these neutrons, the process should avoid use
of light elements, especially Be,F, B, Li, A1, O, Mg, and Na
(in decreasing order of importance).

The presence of 23 2U y especially in core salt reprocessing,
will also produce penetrating radiation. Section 3.5.10.2 dis~

cusses this in more detaile.

3.10 Auxiliary Plant

3.10.1 Power Cycle Options

Generally the primary coclant transfers heat to
1. An intermediate liquid coolant which generates steam for
a. turbine, or to
2. A gas coolant which passes directly to high-efficiency gas
turbines and/or process heat applications,
Melting point, corrosion, and activation (by cielayed neutrons) cone

stitute the main concerns in the auxiliary plant.

3.10.1.1 TIntermediate liguid coolant for steam cycle. Liquid
metals and fused salts, beczuse of their high boiling points
and thermal conductivities allow operaticn at high temperatures
and low pressures. This promates excellent heat transfer with-
out expensive and hazardous high pressure equipment. Low pressure
especially permits use of thin heat-exchanger tubes.

Research earlier on Na-graphite reactors and later on LMFBRs
has produced a broad base of Na technology. Similar technology
exists for the low-melting eutectic Na-K mixture. Either one, but
especially NaK, avoids problems of coolant freezing. NASA-Lewis
has also pioneered the use of K with a K~vapor turbine, getting up
to 65% efficiency. That cycle would probably need more study though.

Unfortunately, alkali metals react vigorously with both steam
and molten salt. A small leak on the high-pressure steam side could
spell disaster. If the alkali leaked into the molten salt , removal

by processing would be hard. Sodium would react with UCl3 to form

362
NaCl and pure U metal; the latter could plate out or otherwise
accumuilate.

Lead behaves better chemically as it.reacts little with either
salt or steam and should not enlarge any leaks. Lead costs a lot
but that has not discouraged the British from checosing it. It will
require development of suitable pumrs and components especially in
regards to corrosion. The inertia associated with lead's high density
will also require high strength construction.

Lead will need auxiliary heating to prevent freezing during
low power and start-up conditions. The cooler parts of the lead
circuit could use low alloy steels but regions above SOOOC may
require other materials: the superheater will need duplex tubing

as lead attacks nickel~bearing alloys.

Molten salts compete favorably with liquid metals: they
exhibit thermal conductivities intermediate to water and the
poorer of the liquid -metals, Their specific heat capacities parzllel
water's. Furthermore, an intermediate coolant of molten salt
should more closcly match the primary salt in physical proper—
ties, thereby reducing freezing and thermal stress problems.
They will cost far less then liquid metals. Table 3.10-I shows
that a wide choice in eutectic melting points exists among
candidate salt mixtures.

Considerable experience exists in pumping and general use
of molten salts, especially in salt baths and petroleum refining
apalications which feature ccnstant high temperatures and con-—

tinuous system operation. Salts work well with Hastelloy N.

However steam leakage into the coclant salt could produce
locally high corrosion. Processing difficulties would arise
if the ccolant leaked into the fuel salt. For these latter
reasons the British decided against molten salts for the sec-

ondary coolant.

3.10.1.2 Coolant for gas cycle. 002 or other oxidizing gas leak-

ing into the fuel salt, would react to form TO That could over-

o0
load the oxide removal section of the salt cleanup plant.

Inert helium avoids this problem. He cooling is also under
development for other reactors along with a He gas turbine. It
should work well with molybdenum heat exchanger tubing although
this is not yet fully endorsed.

Both France and the Soviet Unicn are considering gaseous

364
aluminous chloride to power the first stage of gas turbines; dis-
sociating MO, (N0 A) gas, the second stage.

Lower turbine working pressure with gas should permit more
component prefabrication, That should lower installation times
and save on coﬂstruction and interest charges. Avoiding the steam
generator and tertiary circuit also reduces costs, the extent
depending upon the gas cycle efficiency.

Poor heat transfer properties of gas will penalize the cycle
with a larger heat exchanger. This means higher out-~of—core fuel
salt inventory. One must also analyze the safety of a pressurized

secondary coolant.

3.10.2 Auxi.iary Hardware

3.10.2.1 Pumps. Pumps that circulate molten salts experience un-
usual metallurgical, chemical, physical and mechanical c:énditions.
Salts exhibit temperature-dependent physical properties. At tem—
peratures near 700°C they corrode many structural materials and
deteriorate chemically if exposed to air, water or water vapor.

ORNL successfully tested single-stage centrifugal salt pumps
in the MSRE and in loops at 650°C up to 16,000 hours. Two-stage
semi=-axial pumps may require basic development work. Both pump
designs will require development and testing to successfully in-
crease sizes to the range needed for a 1000 MWe plant.

Both pump designs separate the high~temperature pumping ele~
ments from the primary shaft seal and bearings: this allows the
latter parts to operate near ambient temperatures and to use con-

ventional lubricarntis. An inert gas buffers the space between the

365
high-temperature pumped salt and the primary pump shaft seal.
Elastomeric seals and lubricants must be protected from excessive
gamma heating and radiation damage.

Initially, mechanical pump designs avoided rubbing parts in the
salts; now pumps with journal bearings in the salt have operated
successfully.

No direct experience exisis with high power, continuously-
running lead pumps. The design principles would probably follow
the sodium pump design developed for IMFBRs but with higher power

and strength requirements.

3.10.2.2 Core/blanket seal. Section 3.7 emphasizes guarding against
core fluid leaks more than tianket leaks. Therefore, the core tubes
should be a single entity throughout the reactor witﬁ no pressure
seal between core and blanket salt.

Cne solution might be to route the core tubes through a secand
tube or sleeve which penetrates the reactor vessel. However, such
a sleeve will itself experience high radiation damage and require
replacement. It would also thermalize neutrons. Thus we prefer to
create a blanket seal on the core tube (Figure 3.10-1). Low blanket
pressure enhances the feasibility for it. One could also design a
catcher for limited blanket leakage as part of the blanket reproces—

sing stream. Then, no seal at all might even work.

3.10.3 Filling, Draining and Dump Systems

Two tanks below the reactor vessel serve for filling and drain-
ing. Each can contain the whole salt inventory of core or blanket,

They provide for quick dumping of the core and/or blanket or for

accumilating salt leaks from the reactor vessel. Two more tanks
function as standbys and as delay tanks for salt removal for pro-
cessing, one each for core and blanket. An emergency ccoling
system would remove the decay heat from any tank through the same
lines used for preheating.

Mechanical pumps or gas pressure can transfer the salt. For
initial fillipg the fuel or *lanket salt will be brought to site
in solid form. Electric immsrsion heaters or steam coils that
pass below the surface of a salt bath melt the salt under inert
gas in swall non-critical batches. Heating a solid bath of salt
from the bottom alone can develop sufficient pressure to rupture
equipment or expel the molten salt through the solid surface.

Once molten.the salt can be pumped.into the réactor.

The primary salt circuits will require preheating to about
600°C ; the secondary, less. In some areas it will be more economic
and convenient to heat whole spaces such as the reactor vault and
processing plant; trace heating is better for longer lengths of pipe-
work as in sgcondary pPipes to the steam generators. Submergsd
centrifugal pumps circulate the salt. They are of a type
which permits no cantact of the salt with the packing gland., The

ORNL HMSRE encountered no particular problems with preheating.

368
The ISR uniquely separates, concentrates, and stores part of its wastes
«7ithin the plant for neutron economy, safety, and corrosion protection
of the reactor. Being already in the form of a concentrated heat
source suggests the possibility of dissipating the decay heat by put«
tinz it to works One use could be for preheating. Felium or a low-
melting point salt like Flibe (36300) could be the heating agent. An
auxiliary heater would orovide a backup heat source, espvecially oricr

to accumulating sufficient fission product waste,

3,10,5 Overall Plant Size

Building laycut in the Zritish MCFR(Pu) design is compact: the
reactor vessel and primary circult are small; the plant requires no
elaborate fuel handling machinery. The skewed=-tube configuration and
tube replacement machinery here forfeit some of this compaciness.
If inline pyrochemical reprocessing proves practical and economical,
it should fit in the building with little size increase. This in-
cludes the attendant control and maintenance areas. If feasible,

high pressure storage of fission gases would also save much space.

369
 

3.11 Zconomics

oceveral earlier sections have mentioned potential economic

advantages with MSRs, and MCFRs in particular. This section

attempts to summarize these and others; many come from an in-

ternally-published British study for an MCFR(Pu) [29]..

7.11.1 British Study Results

The MSFR avoids elaborate control systems and complex fuel

handling equipment. This implies cost savings through
compactness and simplicity. However necessary auxiliary
systems increase costse.

Component smallness allows shop fabrication in nearly all
cases,

The simplicity of a chemical type of plant should

be. Reduce construction time with consequent savings in

interest and overhead charges.

If full advantage could be taken of the higher temperature

potential , further savings on plant costs could accrue

with the lead secondary-cooclant/steam plant system.

Should secondary cooling by helium prove feasible (satisfy
safety requirements), the associated temperatures possible

with it might permit use of gas~turbines. Significant

370
savings might then accrue from skipping a tertiary cir-
cuit and using a layout integrated in a pre-stressed con-

crete pressure container vessel,

3.11.1.2 Fuel cycle costs, The British study assumed

1. Off-site solvent extraction of heavy metals

2. Removal of residual fission products

3. Cn-line removal of volatile fission products and salt

clean-up.

L« A reprocessing cycle of three months cooling-off delay

period and three months processing and transport time.

5. A one-month stockzile of fresh fuel at the reactor site.
Comparison of fabrication ard reprocessing costs showed a definite
advantage for an MCFR over the oxide~-fuelled LMFBR, as expected.

If the maximum fuel salt temperatures can increase from the
800°C of the reference lead-cooled case to 920°C, the MCFR(Pu)
inventory could reduce by 25%. It would then approach that for
the oxide-fuelled IMFBR; the doubling time also would then fall
to a value .Ssimilar to that of the LMFBR.

The British also examined the on-line pyrochemical process in
the hope that it would reduce inventory over the aqueous process.
While it appeared technically feasible, the initial-cost estimates
were discouragingly high. These stemmed from

1. Batch processing of small *non—critical" quantities,

2. The remote operation and maintenance involved.

This area needs further study.

371
 

3.11.1.3 Summary. MCFRs appear to offer better economics than
LMFBRs. The fuel cycle costs above assume the well-established
aqueous processing for heavy metal; :.an on-line high-temperature
process only cleans the salt up. Potentially large capital savings
in a high temperature MCFR warrant further study of its plant

design, mainftenapce problems, and safety.

3.11.2 Transvortation Costs

Transportation of convenitional spent reactor fuel incurs large
eosts through

1. The high radiocactivity of the fuel

2. The considerable residuzal heat

3. The presence of fissionable materials.
These necessitate

1. FExtensive shielding materials

2. Small packages or package cooling

3. Cumbersome handling procedures

L. Security (safeguards)

5. Special accident procedures during transport.
The transportation problem largely determines the consuruction sites
for reprocessing plants and the cooling time of the spent fuel before
reprocessing [F44]‘ An MSFR with in-plant reprocessing avoids all of

this except for BG transport.

372
 

d.11.3 Cutage Penalties

An MCFR may experience less downiime than a conventional LWR:
MCFR core tubes should wear out more frequently, but low activity
and the fewness of rmumber should simplify the task. However, problems

related to peripheral equipment malfuncti. .. still apply, and could be

greater with a new concept.
3.11.,, Other Costs

Graphite tubes should be cheap. NaCl will be dirt cheap. T,
abounds in nature more than UOE. An MCFR avoids fuel element fab-

rication and enrichment costs. High flow velocities incur high pump—

ing costse.

L0 SUMMARY

4«1 Pu, Proliferation, Safeguards, Security, and Waste Management

Much concern with the nuclear fuel cycle centers on Pu due
to its carcinogenicity and its potential use in a weapon. One
desires close control less it pollute the environment or be di-
verted {overtly or covertly) to weapons use. Once chenically sep-
arated (relatively easy to do for Pu) it can be put into a pre~
assembled bomb within days. The main difficulty will be to pro-
perly implode the device. National or large subnational groups
might be able to practice that trick beforehand.

Present and prospective solid fuel c¢ycles involve extensive
fuel logistics including elament fabrication, decladding, and post-
operation storage. Molten salt reactors skip these steps, thereby
reducing much of the pollution and diversion dangers.

A reactor an the Th fuel cycle minimizes production of Pu and
heavy actinides by beginning much lower on the atomic weight scale
and usefully consuming them. Fast reactors succeed even better by
enhancing fission, especially for 23&U. This pertains especially
to fast molten salt reactors with a very hard neutron spectrum.

All reactors use or produce weapons—grade fissile fuel. In
the Th fuel cycle, the predominantly—233u fissile fuel discloses
its presence by emitting a hazardous, characteristic highly-
penetrating gamma ray. Any transformation of the reactor to the
U/Pu fuel cycle will evidence a reduced gamma signal.

An #5R alsc allows one to continuously remove the principal

(gaseous) radiation hazard from the fuel and store it away from

374
 

the reactor. This fact plus the ability to transfer the whole
core further underground at a moment's notice should enhance

security ¢f the plant from attack.

L.2 Reactor Design

Exiensive evaluation of core salt properties favors cheap
NaCl as the carrier sait, ThClL for fertile material, and UCl3
for fissile material. High fissile salt proportion (Th/U = 0.5,
30% NaCl) will yield high BG (up to O.4) and enhance actinide
fission due to hard neutron spectrum. However, it also causes
high deubling time and more frequent replacement of radiation-
damaged core tubes.

Doubling time reduces to near 20 years at lower fissile con-
tents (Th/U = 1 to 2, 30% NaCl). The optimum composition should
lie in between these iwo points, depending on the assignment of
priorities. In earlier years of operation one might operate with
a low fissile cantent to achieve low DT, low_ flux levels, and
softer spectrum. Then in later years, when more is known about

radiation damage and the press for available 233

U is diminished,
the plant could switch to a salt of higher fissile coantent so as
to avoid actinide buildup and produce more surplus neutrons(highe-
er BG).

The blanket region could benefit from a thermalizing carrier
salt like 7LiCl or a Iluoride instead of NaCl, but cost and high
melting points, respectively, discourage those.

The optimum core configuration for BG and DT appears to be

a few frequently-replaced, skewed, graphite tubes in a blanket

375
 

bath 2 meters thick: a cost-effective solution to the high flux
levels inherent to this concepts Inner blanket regions definitely
detract: they decrease BG without decreasing the out-~of-core in-
ventory.

L3 Technical and Economic Feasibility

Fast molten chloride reactors have been cursorily considered
before but mainly for the U/Pu fuel cycle. The ORNL MSR program
showed the feasibility of fuel salt circulation. The combinaticn
of that experience and MCFR research (out-of-pile experiments and
theoretical studies, so far) provide a basis for believing the
concept will work.

Chemical stability and corrosion of molten salts are fairly
predictable. Low vapor pressure of the salts enhances safety and
permits low pressure structural components.

Molten fuel state and cooling ocut~of-core simplify component
design in a radiation environment. They forego complicated
refueling mechanism, close tolerances associated with solid fuel,
and mechanical control devices. Molten state and low vapor
pressure of the salts also offer inherent safety advantages.

Graphite and Mo alloys and coatings appear as promising
candidates for prisary sait containment, both in and out of core.
These high temperature materials may permit high fuel salt
temperatures (above 1000°C). This can reduce fuel salt inventory
in the heat exchanger and allow gas turbine cycles and/or process

heat applications using helium as an intermediate and final coolant.

376
 

Use of the MCFR on the Th fuel cycle should greatly expand the
amount of available fuel: three times as much Th exists as U.
The high BG accompanying very fast neutron spectra in some MCFR
designs will enhance the economic retrievability of extensive

low-grade U and Th ores.
