summary

This report deals with a rather exotic "paper reactor” in which
the fuel is in the form of molten chlorides.

(a) Fast breeder reactor with a mixed fuel cycle of thorium/
uranium-233 and uranium 238/plutonium in  which all of
the plutonium can be burned < 4{fu and in which a dena-
tured mixture of uranium-233 and uranium-238 1is used to
supply further reactors. The breedling ratio is relatively
high, 1.53 and the specific power is 0.75 GW(th)/m® of
core.

(b) Fast breeder reactor with two and three zones (internal
fertile zone, intermediate fuel zone, external fertile
zone) with an extremely high breeding ratio of 1./75 and
a specific power of 1.1 GW(th)/m?® of core.

(c) Extremely high flux reactor for the transmutation of the
fission products: strontium-90 and caesium-13/. The effi-
ciency of transmutation is approximately 15 times greater
than the spontanegous beta decay. This high flux burner
reactor is intended as part of a complex breasder/burner
system.

(d) Internally cooled fast breeder in which the cooling agent
is the molten fertile material, the same as in the blanket
zone. This reactor has a moderate breeding ratio of 1.38,
a specific power of 0.22 GW(th)/m?® of core and very good
inherent safety properties.

All of these reactors have the fuel in the form of molten chlo-
rides: PuCl3 as fissile, UCly as fertile (if needed]) and NaCl

as dilutent. The fertile material can be *°®UCl5 as fertile and
NaCl as dilutent. In mixed fuel cycles the 233UC13 is also a fis-
sile component with 232ThC14 as the fertile constituent.

In some special cases a hypothetical meclten fluoride has been

checked using PufF3 as the fissile, UF3 as the fertile and Naf

and Zrl, as the dilutents components. In this case one obtains
a lower but still respectable breeding ratio of 1.5.

In all cases a directly coupled continuously operating reproc-
essing plant is proposed. Some of the technological problems of
reprocessing are discussed. Furthermore the report touches on some
of the difficulties associated with corrosion arising from the
use of these molten media coupled with the irradiation effects
such as structural damage from fast neutrons.
The thermohydraulic studies show that even under the extrems op-
erating conditions of very high neutron fluxes and high specific
powers, cooling is possible, in most cases by out-of core cooling
but also in one or two cases cooling internally in the core.

Some molten salt reactor specific safety problems are discussed.
The influence of fast neutrons on the chlorine, forming sulphur
by the (n,p) reaction has been experimentally investigated and

the results are reported briefly.

With this report the work of several years at the Swiss Federal
Institute for Reactor Research is brought to a conclusion.

The history of the development of fission reactor concepts
using molten salt as fuel media is as old and as complex as
the history of the development of nuclear power 1tself. The
ups and downs have followed those of the parent technology
but the swings have bheen if anything more violent. In 1976
for example molten salt technology all but died out but then
in 1977 a new attempt at revival was bepgun this time associla-
ted with the new interest in proliferation-proof systems.

The author of the present paper has a profound belief that
the concept of molten slat reactors coupled with caontinucus
reprocessing and the associated waste management will become
an lmportant feature of nuclear strategy perhaps in 10 or

20 years time.

In this report the efforts in this field over the last six
years are summarised.
1. MOLTEN SALT REACTORS. GENERAL OESCRIFPTION

 

1.1 Methods of classification

 

There are many ways of classifying a reactor type. One such pos-
sihility is shown here.

a) Method of cooling

b) Flux intensity related also to specific power density

c) Number of zones in the reactor

d) Kind of fissile nuclides and fuel cycles

2) Neutron energy

f) Purpose of the reactor

g) Dilutent for the molten salt
It is clear that such an arbitrary classification is not neces-

sarily internally compatible and not all reactor types fall easily
into the scheme chosen.

1.2 Method of cooling. External: Internal

 

Molten fuel reactors differ from the point of view of the cooling
system. The following are three types of molten fuel reactors:

to the external heat exchanger. In this type of reactor, only fuel
and fertile material are present in the zore (no coolant). The
large amount of molten fuel ocuside the core does not of course
contribute to the critical mass.

This type of reactor has been discussed for example by Nelson,
(Argonne 1967} and Lane (USA 1870) especially as a high flux ma-
terials testing fast reactor.

In externally cooled fast reactors the loss of a portion of the
delayed neutrons could adversely affect reactor contrcl. Also the
biological shielding outside the core is very expensive. In this
paper most of the reactors discussed are externally cooled.
Internally, direct cooled reactors: here the cooling agent is
pumped directly into the core where, after mixing, the fuel in
the lower part of the core 1is separated and pumped out of the
core to the heat exchanger. The direct contact of molten fuel
with molten coolant has several particular advantages! very
good heat transfer, no coolant tubes (or cladding), possibility

of transporting fisslon products.

The disadvantages are unfortunately, also numerocus: problems
of mixing and separating the fuel and cocolant, corrosion, etc.
This type of reactor has also been studies, 2.g. cooled by
molten 1sad (Long, Harwell and Killingback, Winfrith 19679,
cooled by boiling mercury (Taube, Warsaw 196E8) and cooled by
boiling aluminium chloride (Taube, Warsaw 1566). This type of
reactor must be considered as an "extremely exotic type”, and
only some references are given here.

Internally indirectly cooled reactor: here the cooling agent
flows through tubes 1n the core. Heat is transferred from fuel
to cooclant across the tubes. No direct contact between molten
tuel and ligquid or gaseous coolant 1s permitted. These types
have alsc been studled, 1In most cases using sodium as a coolant,
(Nelson, Argonne 1967} or molten chlorides of uranium (Taube,

1970} . Sees Fie. 17.

1.3 Intensity of neutron Flux

 

The molten salt reactors discussed here can be used for two more

or less quite different purposes.

- power production and fissile breeding, wnhich 1s self evident

- neutron production for nuclear transmutation of the long
radionuclides produced in power reactors.

In this report both types have been considered

- power breeding ractors with a mean power level of approx
3 GWlth) and steam production with over critical parameters.

- burner reactors with a very high neutron flux particularly in
the Internal zone for neutron moderaticn when the thermal flux
reaches 3 x 10'% n cm™ %571,

1.4 Number of core zones

 

The division of the reactor into several zones must be consid-
ered from the point of view of neutronics, thermohydraulics
and safety.

The organisatlion of multiple zones is easier in the case of
molten fuel reactors than for solid fuel reactors. In this re-
port two types are discussed

- with two zones

- wlith thrse zones including outer and inner fertile zone,
(see Fig., 1.7,

1.5 Type of Fissile Nuclide. Plutonium: Uranium

 

The fast reactors show excellent neutron properties, not anly
for the fuel cycle:

Uranium -238/Plutonium but also
Thorium -232/Uranium-733

Also a mixed fuel cycle of both types has some spectial advan-
tages. Fig. 1.3 shows the nuclear properties of the fissile nu-
clides.

1.6 MNeutron energy: Thermal and Fast

 

The reactors discussed here are all fast reactors. Thermal reac-
tors however have also been extensively and intensively Investi-
gated during the 1860's and 18/0's in Oak Ridege National Labora-
tory USA. (Rosenthel at all, 1872

1.8 Fuel Components. For Molten ssl+, fluoride and chloride

 

In the thermal molten salt reactor the best fuel compound 1is
unduobtedly the flucrids.

For fast reactors the use of chlorine as the compound seems to

be preferable but the use fo fluorine (as zirconium and sodium
fluoride) as dilutent is not excluded.

1.9 Short resumé& of the classification

 

Table 1.2 brings together all these characteristics in an at-
tempt at classification.

.1 Ailm of this Concept

 

The aim here is to demonstrate the possibility of using a molten
chlorides fast breeder reactor with external cooling as a device
for consuming all plutonium produced, 4n ALtu. At first the re-
actor is fuelled with denatured uranium -233/uranium -238 and
this 1s changed stepwise to a feed of thorium and depleted or
natural uranium only.

such a reactor will have the following phases in its fuel cycle

The data given indicates that in the given geometry the rominal
power and all related values: temperature, temperature gradient,
velocity of circulating fuel, heat sxchange etc. are as for the
steady state reactor with only plutonium fuel in the core (see
section Z2.1.4).

Z2.17.3 The Transient Reactor

 

Very shortly after the start up of the reactor, a significant
amount of plutonium has been produced in the core.

The total amount of plutonium chloride, after having been sepa-
rated from the fission products but mixed with the uranium chlo-
ride and sodium chloride is circulated back into the core. The
amount of fresh U-233 required is correspondingly smaller.

The reactor now burns two fissile nuclides, the uranium-233 and
the reprocessed plutonium. The data given below refers to the
case where approximately half of the fissile uranium-233 is re-
placed by plutonium-239 and plutonium-241.

Based on rather simplified assumptions concerning the isotopic
composition of the plutonium it can be shown that the same core
design 1s capable of burning the mixture of fissile materials
maintaining approximately the same power level.

Tables 2.8, 2.9, 2.10, 2.11% and 2.12 give the equivalent values
previously shown for the build-up phase.

These confirm the sultablility of the core design for both the
bulld-up phase and the transient phase.

2.1.4 The steady state reactor

 

This reactor phase 1s in fact the main abject of the work covered
in this report, the steady state fast breeder reactor having the
following features.

- all the freshly bred plutonium can be burned in the same re-
actor (the history of the transplutonium elements is neg-
lected here).

- to achieve this 4n s4fu burning of plutonium the reprocess-
ing of the irradiated fuel is limited to the separation of
all or just the most neutron absorbing fission products and
directly coupled to the reactor

- for the next generation of reactors the fuel is produced in
the form of denatured uranium, that is an isotopic mixture
of

10.5% uranium -233 (produced in this breeder)
89.5% uranium -238 (from the mine cor depleted uranium stock-
piles)

- for over 80% of the lifetime of this plant, that is ~30 years,
the reactor burns its own plutonium and produces the uranium
-233 for the next breeder generation. Tables 2.13 toc 2.17
glve the corresponding data for this reactor phase as before.

2.17.5% Comparison of the three phases

 

In spite of this rather over -simplification it seems that the
proposed reactor design 1s suited for burning:

uranium -233 in th first phase

uranium -233 and plutonium in the second phase
plutonium in the steady state phase.

(see Fig. 2.3)

As a first approximation the timetable of such a reactor will
be as follows

- doubling time aporoximately 4 years (including the out of core
inventory).

- transient periocd (going from U-233 of plutoniuml] approximately
2 years.

- steady state period approx 30 years dincluding shutdown periods
for the exchange of the coreg vessel etc. See Tapble 2.18

It should be emphasised that the era when fusion reactors are
replaced by other eneregy sources and hence the plutonium burners
are shut-down, has not been dealt with.

Fven here it is conceivable that a reactor desipn could be prooas-
ed which only consumes and thus be used in this shutdown phase.
This however has not been calculated.
2.2 Impact of some parameters on the mixed zone two zone fast
breeder

 

In this section some intermediate results are presented concern-
ing the influence of selected parameters in this design, and giv-
ing the breeding capability of a two zone fast breeder reactor.
(Table 2.19)

The influence of mutual displacement.

L(Pu -239) + $(U-233) = 9 x 107" (10%%atom. cm~?)

by five steps from A to E 1s given in Table 2.20 and Fig. 2.5

and 7.6.

The influence of the thickness of the external blanket, which
contains thorium, on the total breeding ratio and the volume of
the core for a given case of the following concentrations of
fissile nuclides

PU-239 3.5 x 10°% (10%%atcm. cm™?)
U-233 10.0 x 107% (10%“atom. cm- )

is given in Table 2.20.

For the same case the partisl BR's and BR total are shown in

!

Fig. 2.7 and Fig. 2.8
In addition the followling 4 reactor designs have been calculated

having the following arrangement

Cors Pu-239 1.1 x 10% —> 1.8 x 10% (x10%“atom. cm™?)
U-233 3.4 x 107 %— 5.5 x 107" (x10%“atom. cm %)
11-233/Pu-239 = 3.1

The data are given in Tab. 2.217. Other results are found in

2.3 Material balance of the state reactor

 

The most importarnt feature of this reactor is the 4n s4fu
consumption of plutonium. The studies show this to hbe feasable.
Fig. 2.72 gives the resulting material balance for the steady
state reactor.

! Conclusions

The molten chlorides fast breeder is ideally suited to the (-
s4tu burning of plutonium matching the current requirement for
a "proliferation safe” concept.

3.1 THE THREE ZONE REACTOR

 

3.71.1 Introduction

The reactor discussed now is rather unconventional because of
its three zones (see Fig. 1.2])

- internal blanket zone
- fuel zone

- external blanket zone

This concept has been compared with the more conventional type.
Holding most of the parameters the same the breeding galn comes
out about equal. However, cne large difference is that although
the total power is the same the specific power changes by more
than one magnitude being higher in the conventicnal central fuel
zone reactor. Also the mean neutron flux increases from

1.2 x 10'%n em™?s™ ! for the non-conventicnal central blanket zone

to 2 x 10'"’n em™?s~! for the conventional central fuel zone.

Since the specific power and intensity of neutron flux 1s clearly
a major proolem form the point of view of the engineering deslign
of the reactor (cooling, radiation damape of structural matericl
and fuel), both systems have been studied, that 1s without a cen-
tral blanket region and with a radius up to 110 cm. The results
are given b=low for fuel without uranium and with uranium

fuel for both cases: no internal blanket zone and with an inter-
nal blanket zone.
3.17.2 The three zone breeder with thorium/uranium-233

 

The first case is the fast breeder molten salt reactor with
uranium-233 as fissile and thorium-232 as fertile material
with a three region layout.

- internal fertile zone 1, 50, 90, 110 cm
- wall 2z cm
- spherical shell core 19 cm
- wall 3 cm
- external fertile zone 110 cm
- reflector 40 cm

Table 3.1 gives the malin details of the reactor.

L

.2 A Three zone breeder reactor with a mixed fuel cycle
U-238/Pu-239 plus Th-232/U-233

 

The next step is a study of a mixed fuel cycle in the three zaone
tast breeder reactor. This problem has received much attenticn
and the published papers given in list D should be referred to.

A three zone fast breeder reactor with the geometry shown in
table 3.1 has been calculated.

The range of variations covered include

Pu-239 or U-233 in the core
U-238 Th-232 in the blanket

For a given geometry and concentration of ertile and fissile nu-
clides the influence of the fission products, when the concentra-
tions are increased by a factor 10 results in a reduction in the
breeding ratio by 5%. An increase by a factor 10 in proactinium
decreases the breeding ratio by only 2% (Fig. 3.4).

For the three zone reactor calculations have also been made for
mixed fuel cycles. For the fissile materials Pu-239 and U-233
and for fertile materials with U-238 in the core only and Th-232
in the blanket only.

ihe influence of parameter variatlions 1s given in Fig. 3.5.
The following results can be noted:

the breeding ratio increases (under the given conditions) when
- the concentration of U-233 in the core decreases and U-238

increases

- when the internal wall thickness is halved (note this is very
sensitive due to the presence of 15 atom% of molybdenum)

- when the outer fertile radius increases

- when the inner fertile zone radius 1increases,

3.3 The three zone reactor - uranium-plutonium fuel cycle

 

The reference reactor is described in table 3.5 and 3.5. The
thermal flux in all three zones, the external breeding zone,
the fuel and the internal breeding zone is only 107% of the
total flux and in the external hlanket reaches 10°% of the to-
tal Flux. The total flux has a relatively flat distribution and
even in the fuel region the max. to mean ratio 1s only about
1.13 (Fig. 3.6 and Fig. 3.7].

The neutron flux 1s rather hard and the mean neutron energy
(calculated as the mean of the no. of fissions) is around

370 keV {see Fig. 3.3). In a typical LMFBR and in a gas cooled
fast breeder this value is 120 keV and 176 keV respectively.

A good illustration of the influence of the most Important
papameters on the breeding ratio is given in table 3.7. The
differences between these calculations and the computur out-
put is approx 8%.

3.4 The three zone breeder reactor: Very high bresding gain

 

Cne of the most important factors in achieving a very high breed-
ing ratio is the hardness of the neutron flux. This is strongly
influenced by the fuel composition.

In this case the fuel is postulated to be a mixtura of

a PuCly - b NaCl - ¢ UCL 5 where
a = 0.1 - 0.2, b = 0.7 - 0.8, c = 0.1 - 0,2

Untortunately not all data are available for this system. (see
Fig. 06.9)

IThe rough calculations on changing the concentration of PuCl, in
the melt of NaCl (Fig. 3.8) shows a rather sharp decrease of
breeding gain (BG) for decreasing plutonium concentration, ecope-
cially when the plutonium molar ratio to sodium is lower than
0.2h.

[n spite of these uncertainties of the PuCla-NaCl-UCly system,
the influence of the U-238 in the fuel has also been calculated.
For a constant PuCly concentration with a simplified assumpticn
for the Nall concentration the results are given in Fig. 3.10
and 3.11.

Inereasing the ratio of uranium to plutonium in the fuel from

U to 3 causes the total breeding gain to increase from 0.565 &0
1.895. This i1s rather clear and thus the reference reactor con-
cept includes uranium In the fuel in a ratio of 2 : 1 to pluto-
nium.

Such @ high breeding gain 1is a special feature of this type of
reactor for producing large quantities of fissile material.

Fig. 3.12 and 3.13 give the results of calculation when the ra-
dius of the central fertile zone is varied. Table 3.8 shows the
simplified calculation of central and external fertile zone
brerding ratios.

From these results the following conclusions can be drawn

- increasing the ralus cof the internal fertile zone up to 110 cm
increases tLhe breeding gain for a given type of fuel. The ef-
fect of wall and fertile material changes are insignificant

- at the same time the specific power decreases dramatically

- lincreasing the U/Pu ratio from 2 to 3.6 does not influence
the total breeding gain (see Fig. 3.13)

- the FP concentrations play a rether significant role (Fig. 3.14)

The Influence of the 40 cm reflector if changed from iron to lead
is not very great as shown in table 3.0

Fission product concentration however plays a very important role.
For a given reactor design and riven fuel and fertile compositions,
increasing the concentration of fission products (gsimulated here
with Cs-133 only) from 2x107° to 2x107% (in 10°*/cm?) decreases the
breeding gain from 0.65 to 0.38 when the specitic power decreases
less than a factor two.

It can be seen that introducing three zones does not result in

Therefore the two zone reactor must be preferred for its simpler
layout.

3.5 The two zone fast breeder. Fuel of uranium plutonium
flucrides

 

3.5.1 Introduction

The aim of this section is to give a rough idea of a fast
breeder power reactor having the fuel in form of plutonium
trifluoride in the molten state instead of molten chloride.
(Table 2.171)

The earier suggestions for a reactor of this type came from
A.M. Weinberg.

The first attempts at carrying out calculations on a reactor
of this type were not successful because a fuel was chosen
having a high concentration of light metals, lithium and hbe-
ryllium.

A very rough attempt by J. Ligou and the author (1372) shows
the possibility for & fast breeder reactor with molten pluto-
nium fluoride where the light metals were eliminated and the
melting point increased.

F'. Faugeras (Fautenay aux Roses) claimed that the fluoride of
U-233 and Th-232 can be used for non-thermal reactors.

Some preliminary results for a three zones reactor arec given

in = short form 1in Tabhle 2.77. The neutron flux remains ratha»
hard (Fig. 2.15].

3.5.2 Arbitrary assumptions and uncertainties

 

The fuel composition has been arbitrarily chosen since the
appropriate data is lacking in the literature. In most cases
the following fuel composition has bean used

1 PuF, / 1.2 NaF (T 1p © 727°¢)
© 2.4 NaF /1 Ir F, (T 10 7 510°0)
ancther alternative would be
PuF3 /2 Naf
CaF., / 3 NaF (T = 820°0)

The results obtained, in spite of the uncertainties are en-
couraging. The simplified breeding ratio calculation gilves a
BRy5+ of 1.51 and the computed value is BRy,t = 1.465 (table
5.13).

Table 3.14a shows that the influence of fission products is
very significant (see also Fig. 3.16). However the change of
structural material of the wall form beryllium to 1ron has
cnly a small effect on the breeding ratic and specific power
(table 3.14b and Fig. 3.17).

In the calculations for three zones studies here, 1ncreasing
the radius of the internal fertile zone from b0 cm to 80 cm,
that 1s a volume increase of Z2.37 has little effect on the
total breeding ratio in spite of changes in the regional
hreeding ratios (table 3.15a and Fig. 3.187].

Altering the small amounts of plutonium in the fertile material
as a result of reprocessing efficlences also has only a small
effect on the breeding ratic and specific power (tablie 3.75hb
and Fig. 3.19).

Becouse of the good experience of American and French groups
using graphite as a structural material for molten fluordie
thermal breedears, calculations have been made using grapnite
for separating walls for fast breeders. Graphite 2 cm thick
as the wall material was chosen.

The results are rather encouraging. The breeding ratio using
eraphite is still very high, even slightly higher and the
specific power in the fuel is lower (table 3.10a and Fig. 5.207].

Changing from the complicated design of three zones with fuel
In the intermediate shell, to the "classical” two zone design
having fuel in the central region results in a dramatic 1n-
crease in specific power to a prohibitive 26 kW.cm™? (table
3.160, Fig. 3.27, tabie 3,177,

.2 Burner reactor with molten fluoride fuel
3.6 High Flux Reactor with Fluoride Fuel

 

Can a fluoride fuelled burner, as opposed to a chloride fuelled
reactor be considered as a reactor for transmuting fission pro-
ducts? (See chapter 4, for the high flux transmutation reactor).

In such a reactor a fuel made up of PuF3/5.4 NaF/2.4 ZrF, has
been assumed. The calculations have been carried out for a
larger bruner of 11 GW(th) and the fission products are assumed
to be generated in a total system of 55 GW(th).

The results are not encouraging in spite of the fact that the
neutron lfux in the target region was 1.05 times higher for

the fluoride fuelled reacotr as opposed to the chloride fuelled
reactor (Table 3.18, Fig. 3.22).

The effective half life of both fission product nuclides was
(in years)

In fluoride In chloride
fuelled fuelled
reactor reactor

(reference)
Cs~137 8.57 8.93
Sr-90 1.73 1.83

These "benefits” must be balanced against a specific power which
is twice as high as the reference case. In the fluoride cors this
is 18.9 GW.m"® and for the chloride reactor 10.1 GW.m~3. Such a
high specific power is not realisable.

In addition since graphite might be used in place of beryllium
oxide as moderator (possible for a neutronic viewpoint) a signifi-
cant improvement in corrosion problems is obtained. This has been
proved by the excellent experience of 0Oak Ridge National Labora-
tory with one proviso - at ORNL the fuel was LiF - BeFo - ThFg -
UFg4 .

4. A HIGH FLUX BURNER REACTOR FOR TRANSMUTATION

 

4.1 Need for fission product transmutation

 

4,11 Introduction

The problems associated with the management of highly radio-
active fission product waste has been intensively and exten-
sively discussed (Fig. 4.1).

Here only the transmutation of fission preoducts (F.P.) is
dealt with. The recycling of the actinides is not treated.
Transmutation occurs by using neutron irradiation in a fis-
sion reactor.

A snhort outline of this chapter can be presented in ths form
of the following questions

- why, contrary to many assertions, 1s neutran transmutation
in a fusion reactor naot feasable? - this in spite of the
tfact that the fusion machine has often been proposed far
this purpose

- why are recant opinions concerning transmutation in fis-
sion reactors rather pessimictic?

- could transmutation In a fission reactor be possible taking
into account the neutron balance in a breeding system?

- which fission products are candidates for irradiation in sa
tission reactor?

- 1s the rate of transmutation sufficiently high in a fission
reactor?

- in what type of reactor is the transmutation physically
possible?

- what are the limiling parameters for transmutatlion in a
solld fuelled fission reactor?

- 1s a very high flux fission reactor possible if the fuel is
in the liguid state instead of the solid state?

Comment

Inm BNWL-1900 1t was noted that the calculation (in a moderating
blanket of the CRT) represents a more realistic blanket config-
uration with a neutron wall loading of 10 MW/m? (This is still
a very optimistic value. M.T.]).

In this case the following data have been obtained for a therma-
lised neutron flux from a CTR with a 10 MW/m? wall loading.(Tab.1.

The conclusions of this study are that useful guantitlies of
Cs-137 could be transmuted under the projected CTR blanket
loading conditions. The reduction in Cs-137 "ftoxicity" is still
expected to be at most a factor 3 down. In addition a study of
the bulld-up of fission product nuclei in order to establish
fLhe requirements of periodix chemical processing and associated
costs has not been carried out.

H.W. Lefevre (appendix to BNWL-1300) makes an interesting
comment on the study of the transmutation of Cs-137 and Sr-30
in CTR: "Everyone knows that a CTR will be "clean”. Don't
spoil that illusicn. I think that I would worry some about

a CIR loaded with 50 kg of Cs-137".

4.1.2 Why some opinicons concerning transmutations in a fis-
sion reactor are rather pessimistic

 

A recent and meost intensive study of the use of a fission re-
actor for the tranmsmutation of fission products has been pub-
lished by Claiborne (1972). He writes:

"The problem fission products cannot be eliminated by any
system of fission power reactors operating in either a stag-
nant or expanding nuclear power economy since the production
rate exceeds the elimination rate by burnout and decay. Only
at equilibrium will the production and removal rates be equal
2 condition that 1s never attained in power reactors. Equilib
rium can be obtained, however, for a system that includes the
stockpile of fission products as part of the system inventory
since the stockpile will grow until its decay rate equals the
net production rate of the system. For the projected nuclear
power economy, however, this will reguire a very large stock-
pile with its associated potential for release of large quanti-
ties of hazardous radio-isotopes to the environment, It is this
stockpile that must be greatly reduced or eliminated from the
biosphere. A method suggested by Steinberg et al. is transmuta-
tion in "burner reactors”, which are designed toc maximize neu-
tron absorption in separated fission products charged to a
reactor. If sufficient numbers of these burners are used, the
fission products inventory of nuclear power system can then
reach egquilibrium and be maintained at an irreducible minimum,
which 1s the guantity contained in the reactors, the chemical
processing plants, the transportation system, and in some in-
dustrial plants.

-
- a3 -

If the assumption 1s made that burner reactors are a desirable
adjunct to a nuclear economy, what are the design requirements
and limitations: it is obvious that they must maximize (with
due regard to econcmics) the ratio of burnout of a particular
fission products to its producticon rate in fission reactors,
and the neutron flux must be high enough to cause a significant
decrease in its effective half-1ife. 0Of the fission types, the
breeder reactor has the most efficient neutron economy and in
principle would make the most efficient burner if all or part
ot the fertile material can be replaced by a Sr-Cs mixture
without causing chemical processing problems or too large a
perturbation in the flux spectrum because of the different
characteristics of these fission products. The cost accounting
in such a system would set the value of neutrons ahsorbed in
the fission product feed at an accounting cost equal to the
value of the fuel bred from those neutrons.

The maximum possible burnout of fission products would occour
when the excess neutrons per fission that would be absorbed

in a fertile material are absorbed instead in the fission pro-
duct +feed. The largest possible burnout ratic would then be the
hreeding ratio (or conversion ratio for nonbreeders) divided
by the fission product yield. The estimated breeding ratio for
the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR), a thermal breeder, is
1.05% and for the Liquid Metal Fuelled Fast Breeder Reactor
(LMFBR), 1.368. The yield of '"*7Cs + ?%Sp {5 0.12 atom/fission,
but a number of other isotopes of these elements are produced
which would also absorb neutrons. However, if the fission pro-
duct waste 1s aged two years before separation of the cesium
and strontium, the mixture will essentially be composed of
about 80% '*7Cs + °%3Spr and 20% '*°Cs (which will capture neu-
trons to form '?°®Cs that decays with a 13-day halflife conse-
quently the maximum burnout ratio for '?*7Cs + ?%Spr will be de-
creased by 20%. This leads to a maximum possible burncut ratio
of about /7 for the MSBR and about 9 for the LMFBR. Unfortunately,
however, the neutron fluxes in these designs are well below
10'%n em™ 257!, Any modifications of these designs to create
high neutron fluxes will increase the nectron leakage and de-
crease the burnout ratios significantly”. (Claiborne 10772)
it 1is not clear why Claiborne claimed that after 2 years ageing

and separation of strontium and caesium the isotope composition
will be

Cs-137
S5r-90

20% Cs-135

80%

From Crouch (1373) the fission products of U-235 have the fol-
lowing composition (2 years ageing) (in at % per fissioned nu-
clecus). {see Table 4.4)

 

Sr-88 (stable) 3.63
Sr-90 (28 years) 4.389
Ca-133 (stable) B.57
Cs-134 (2 years) 3.5 (7.08 0.5 from independent yield)
Cs-135 6.20
Cs-137 5.99
Subtotal 30.34

 

The realistic data are unfortunately more than twice those cited
by Claiborne.

The same negative oplnlions concerning the use of Fission Reactors
for F.P. - transmutation are given by the following authors:

A.5. Kubo (BNWL - 1800):
"Fission products are not conductive to nuclear transforma-
tion as a general solution to long term waste management”.

BNWL - 1800, itself:

"In summary it is improbable that transmutaticn of fission
orocducts in fissilon reactors could meet any of the technical
feasibility requirements for the production of stable daugh-
ters”.

Claiborne (1972):
"Developing sprcial burner reactors with the required rneutron

flux of the order of 10'"n cm™?s” ! is beyond the limits of
current technology”.
4.1.3 Which fission products are suitable candidates for
transmutation and in what guantities?

A simplified breakdown of neutrons and fission products produced
by fission of 1 fissile plutonium atom is given in Fig. 4.4

From this it must be clear that only a very limited amount of
fission products can be irradiated by neutrons of the whole
system to retalin a good breeding gain and doubling time - in
other words a s elf sustaining and expanding breedinpg system.
For further consideration it is postulated that the maximum num-
ber of transmutable nuclides equals T = 0.3.

the proposed system for the transmutation includes two types
of reactor:

- power reactcocrs in the form of fast breeder reactore with s
total power of three to four times that of:

- a high flux burner reactor.

The crucial F.P. nuclidas are characterised in table 4.4 to-
pether with others. The data available now makes it possible
to estimate Lhe number of candidates for transmutation in our
breeder/burner system, using the tollowing criteria

- thr total amount of all nuclides to he ftransmuted cannot be
greater than the estimated value of T = 0.30, that is 30 atoms
of F.F. nuclides for each 100 fissiorned nuclides.

- the order of priority taken from this table is given as
Cs > 5r> T > Te

- in the first instance no isotopic separation process is
postulated.

Tanle 4.4 shows the F.P. nuclides selected for transmutation.

4.17.4 In what way could a burner reactor be coupled to a
system of breeders?

The aim of the calculations used here is to show

- Lthat given a system containing some breeding power reactors
with a breeding gain of P

- the fission products from all of these reactors can be tans-
muted in the high flux burner reactor, which includes of
course the fission product transmutation for the burrer re-
actor itself.

For times longer than ty only one burner is operated and the

We shall postualte that it has no sense to operate this last
burner when the amount of F.P. is only 1.2 times longer than
the asymptotic value which requires a new time interval

The total time t, - t, will be the sum (6) + (7) which corresponds

Further reductions can only be obtained by natural decay (t>tOJ.

Numerical application: with X = 4,n = 100 which means the sconomy
was based before t,, on 400 breeders, the initial F.P. amount is
reduced 415 times when the last burner is shutdown. Then the re-
quired time is defined by grre(tg-tp) = 8.83 (8.76 with the approx
expression). If this time is to be less than say B0 years 2 re-
actor generations) then Agpp = 4.7x1077s-! (ty, eff = 4.7 years).

Now the problem of the intensity of the neutron flux desired for
transmutation arises. Since the most hazardous F.P. nuclides are
those which apart from their high metabolic activity and high re-
tention in living organismus also have a half life of the same
order as a human life span of 60-70 years we arrive at the fol-
lowing list of hazardous isotopes which are the most important
for transmutation.

4.17.6 In what reactors are the transmutations possible?

 

From the point of view of this paper the most important process
is the transmutation of some of these nuclides by neutrons in a
fission reactor. The criteria given in chapter 2 limit the choice
of system. That 1is

- the number of F.P. nuclei cannot be too iarge in relation to
the number of fissioned atoms 1in the burner reactor (reactor
for transmutation) because the latter process also produces
new fission products.

- the fission reactor should be self-sustaining - that is a
breeding system.

- the specific power of the reactor i1s preoportional to the neu-
tron flux. High neutron flux means high specific power which
is controlled by the effectiveness of the core cooling.

- the specific power F and the neutron flux ¢ are coupled by
the fission creoss section and the concentration of fissile
nuclide (Ng)

For thermal neutrons op is approx. /00 barns and for fast neutrons
only 1.8 barns, that 1s 400 times smaller.

For the given totel power and the same specific power the product
Need for the thermal reactor must be approx. 400 times smaller
than for a fast reactor. Since the critical concentration of fis-
sile nuclides in a thermal reactor can only be 10 times smaller
than for a fast reactor then for a given specific power the neu-
tron flux 1n a fast reactor can be about 40 times higher than that
of a thermal reactor.

The cross section for thermal neutrons for the nuclides considered
here 1s from 3 to 10 times larger than in a fast flux and Lhis
must be taken 1into account.

All these factors bring us to the following solution of the prob-
lems under discussion.

- the highest specific power and hence the highest neutron flux
is pogsible if the cooling process is carried out by the fuel
itself and not by a separate cooling agent only.

This directs our interest towards a reactor with molten fuel
in spite of the exotic nature of this solution.

- the high flux reactor must be a fast reactor (small for fast
fission)
- 107 -

- because Otp > Ofggt the thermalisation of the high flux in a
internal thermal zone is postulated, then it is possible that

zone S core
therm. fast

- the first approximation is made for an isotopically pure radio-
nuclide e.g. Cs5-137 without Cs-133 (stable) and Cs-135 and also
Sr-30 without Sr-88 (stable).

The discussion then results in:

- transmutation of Cs-137 (and some other nuclides) in a ther-
malilised central trap of high flux neutrons:

®therm = 5x10'® n cm%g7!

- production of a high flux of fast neutrons 5x10'® n cm™?s ' and
the high specific power of 15 kW em™® is achieved by means of

liguid fuel circulating through an external cooler.
- transmutation of other selectred fission products in an external
thermalised zone with a thermal flux of 5x10'° or

1%10Y° n cm™%s™ 1,

- coupling of one burner - high flux fast burner reactor with a
system of 'normal' power breeder reactors.

4.1.7 What are the limitations of a solid fuelled reactor?

 

Can the desired specific power of 15 kWem™® be achieved in a solid

fuel reactor? These are the self-evident limits in this case.

- the rate of burning of fissile nuclides is limited due to
depletion of fissile or an increase of F.P. nuclides

- the heat transfer limitation of fuel/clad to coolant

- the temperature and temperature gradients 1n the fuel and
cladding (melting, mechanical properties)
- 108 -

- the boiling of the coolant

- the limitation of coolant velocity,

Now we discuss these limitations in more detail

- the dwell time in a solid fuelled reactor in core for the

Using now a simplified model for the first guess of the tempera-

- 0.03 _ o
ATclad = 3000 T T 6/5°C

It is evident that this result is not reslistic.

 

The solution of this problem may be the thermalisation of neutrons
in a high flux fast core and the irradiation of Cs-137 in a thermal
central zone.

In such a thermal central zone we postulate (and this must be based
later on oorocalculations)

Spp 7Tl 0p oy

to reach ®¢p = 6.0 x 10'% we require ds5et = 5.0 x 10'¢ n om™ 2571,

For this fast flux the specific power can be assumed, if weo take
into account the effective increase of the fission cross section
because of the influence of the thermal trep. The simplified cal-
culation results in a specific power of 10 kW cm™?®.

The corresponding heat-flux is therefore reduced to

This value 15 still rather high. A rough estimate of the thermal

and the corresponding values for stainless steel (13-9 0OL)
o = g « 154078 (K71) o« 323 (K) « 2.5¢10%(Kpecm™?) = 5500 Kpecm™?

It 1s also evident that this rescult 1s not realistic!

The resulting thermal stress in the cladding wall coupled with the
high flux is prohibitive.

Hiere, the most important problem 1s the local overheating by the
thermal flux present at the interface of the thermal column and
the sollid fuel core. If, 1n the fast region near to the interface
apprax. 20% of the enrgy comes from the thermal neutrons, the fol-
lowing ratio of fluxes must be achileved:

That the thermal flux must be 2000 times lower than the fast, would
seem very difficult to realise.
1.7.8 The liquid-fuelled fast reactor with central thermal zone

 

A much better solution is using a liquid-fuel. The transfer of
the heat generated is done, by pumping and cooling the liguid
fuel ocut of core.

For a unit cell of 1 ecm®, which in this case consists of fuel
only, we can write the following heat-balance.

3 = . . —— . = C t : 3 B - - 3 ® - 1

W = velocity of fuel (cm/s)

T/ = Ltemperature increase per unit

cell (Ksem™ 1)

P = Specific power (Wecm™ ?)
speC

If we allow in the core a temperature increase of AT/1 ~ 3 degecm !

 

This velocity appears to be within the practical limits proposed
for a fuel-velocity of 40 m.s™! for a reactor with 10 kW.com™?
specific power. This point however has to be seriously investi-
gated, as erosion dus to high velocities is a problem.

For a /7000 MW(th) core with a specific power of 21 kWecm™? the
fuel volume is about 0.330 md.

The target volume, that is the volume of irradiated (transmuted)
fission products e.g. Cs-137, is postulated as 1.3 m®. The dia-
meter of a spherical core is therefore 146 cm. The temperature
increase of the unit cell of fuel, in one pass through the core,
rquals approximately

T = 3 (dacecm ') « 148 (cm) = 438°C
tunl = :

and for a fusl inlet temperature of 5507C we reach an outlet tem-
perature of approx. g88°¢C.
The idea of a liquid fuel high flux reactor has been discussed
for some years. Lane (1371) for exemple writes about high flux
fas reactors:

"As an alternative some consideration has bzen given at Uak Ridge
to the possibility of using a molten salt reactoras a fast flux
test facility. The primary virtue of this approach includes the
abhility to achieve very high power densities and at the same

time eliminate the down time associated with refuelling the re-
actor. A fast spectrum molten salt reactor however reguires a
hieh fissile concentration (i.e. 300 to 500 ¢ ?3°U/litre) in
order to get mean neutron energies in the range of 10 to 50 keV.
Switehing from an NaF - UF,; salt (on which the energy range

Jjust mentioned is based) to a chloride-salt reactor would permit
a higher mean energy for the same fuel concentration but would
roquire the development of a new technology assoclated with the
uce of chlorides. Since the fast flux level is largely determin-
2d by the power density a flux of the order of 10'% or more cor-
responds to a peak power density in the fuel salt In a range of

5 to 10 MW/litre and to a power level of about 1000 MWlthl. This
means that there will be only 100 to 200 litres in the core:
however the external volume would be about 10’000 1itres”.

 

4.2 The Neuvtron-physical Aspects of the High Flux Reactor

Fig. 4.10 gives some of the given transformations which may
coccur under a high flux. (Reomark: Fig. 4.3 and 4.9 omited)

In this system the following simple assumptlons are made

- the amount of fission products come from both the fast power
reactor breeders and the thermal burner.

- the fuels and materials are continually reprocessed

- the irradiated fission products are continously (or periodi-
cally) separated in order to eliminate the daughter stable
nuclides (e.g. Zr-90 and 7r-91) from the decay and burning
of Sr-90

- the amounts of transmutated nuclides in the steady state [(88)
irradiation are calculated by the obvious relationships for
the i-th nuclide.

A4.72,.7 Neutronic celculations

 

A reference burner reactor concept 1s shown in Flg. .77, The
flux trap is surrounded by a Be0 beryllium oxide spectrum con-
vertor, a critical fuel thickness and an outer wall [see Table
4,5 and Table 4.6). Fig. 4.12 shows the calculated flux distri-
hution. The total flux in the fuel is similar to that in the
flux trap [(Fig. 4.13)

~J

4.72.3 Moderation reguirements

 

To form a thermal neutron flux Ttrap one must naturally use nou-
tron moderating materials. As is well known, light materials can
scatter neutrons past the neutron-absorbing intermediate-ensrgy
resonance region. jH 1s the most efficient nuclide in this re-
spect but als exhibits appreciable thermal absorption. Deuterium
70, beryllium %BB and arbon %gﬁ are usual alternatives. Oxygen 15@
is rather heavy though frequently already present in a molecular
combination., Other light nuclides have unacceptable nuclear or
physical limitations.

Considering chemical and physical properties, the logical mate-
rials to be used inside the lux trap are hydroxide and/or deuter-
oxide compounds of the FP. Fig. 4.14A shows that just a small
proportion of H molar fraction has a large deleterious effect

on the Cs-13/7 transmutation rate. This is due to the H absorp-
tion cross section. Therefore, Cs00 and Sr(0D), are preferred.

As Sr-80 and Cs-13/7 also have their fair share of resonances it
l1s advantageous to thermalise the flux before reaching the flux
trap region contailning these targets. Therefore a spectrum con-
verter between flux trap and fast fuel is needed. Bearing in
mind the high temperatures to be obtained in this reactor and
possible chemical reactions with molten salt, H-0 and D50 are
unacceptable. This leaves Be, Bel and graphite or some variant
therefore for consideration. Be {(and D) compounds, of course,
have also to thelr advantage a relatively low (n,2n) threshold
(1.67 MeV). Locetion nect to a fast region can therefore pro-
duce considerable very slow neutrons in the flux trap - which
1s a main objective of the burner reactor. Replacement of Be

by € or Mo wall material should therefore lower the FP trans-
nutation rate, and 1L does. (Table 4.7 Fig 4.148) indicates an
optimum thilckness of about 5 cm Be. For the sake of safety and
nigher melting temperature, BeO is preferred over Be.

.24 Influence of other parameters

 

The influence of plutonium concentration (Fig. 4.14C) is an im-
nortant parameter of this reactor. Increasing the plutonium con-
centration significantly improves the transmutation rate but also
increases the power density above a technically feasable level
(Fig. 4.14D). Snhe also Fip. 4,15,

Increasing the reactor power (Fig. 4.16A) from 5 to 11 GW(th)]
improves the transmutation rate. However a power unit above

7 OW{th) seems to be beyond the technological limit even for
the distant future. The reference case has been taken as

/7 CWlth).

The use of beryllium [(Fig. 4.168B and 4.16C) instead of iron 1in
the reflector of the core improves the transmutation rate sig-
nificantly. At the same time the power density increases pro-
hibitively (Fig. 4.160). The reference case contains iran in
the reflector.

Molten fuel offers the only way of handling the very high power
densities of 10 GWm-*., In addition the very steep gradient of
fission rate makes a molten fuel core essential since the local
fission density can be one order of magnitude greater than the
mean density. In a solid fuel core the high heat removal rates
would not be achievable.

The use of boron to absorb the thermal neutrons resulfts in a de-
finite decrease in the rate of caesium transmutation (Fig. 4.1/7).

The large size of the thermal flux trap results In the fuel re-
~ion approaching slab geometry with attendant high neutron leak-
age. To better economise on neutrons several possibilities may

e tried

- use of an optimised reflector such as te, NI, Cu or s to
minimise the crifical mass

- use of the outer neutron leakage for breeding
- use of the neutror leakage for additional FP ftransmutation

To begin with a solid Fe reflector was assumed (Fig. 4.18].

1.3 Thermohydraulic considerations

 

We now examine the thermohydraulic implications (for more detail
sne ch. 8.

The crucial parameter here is the core power density. The given
value 1s high but still near the present state of the art
(Table 4.08).

For comparison, power densities for some high flux reactors.

4.4 Some results

Farametric studies were made as variations arcund a reference
system which assumed P = 11 GW(th) (X = 2+8, K = 4-2) and Rg7 =
78¢5 em. The flux trap is surrounded by 5 cm BeD converter, a
critical fuel thickness of b6+6 cm and an outer wall. Fig. 4.19
shows the calculated flux distributions for such a burner re-
achtor. Note that the total flux in the fuel 1s similar to that
in the flux trap. The calculated fluxes lead to the conclusion
that

(total spectrum, flux trap) = V2«(E=0.0253)

The result indicates the relative effect of X on the ratio R of
the FP Ltransmutation rate Lo FP production rate for the reactor
system. It can be seen that X should be kept as low as possible.
Absclute resulls will depend on the Cs and Sr densities in the

flux trap. A value of R = 1 was achieved for both FP nuclides
at X = 4«5, The F.P. atom ratio there was (Cs-137) / (Sp-90) =

7 >
/ o ).

Another Important problem is the relatively high flux in the outer
zone or leakage from the core.

This flux can be used for two purposes:

1) for transmutation of other fissicon products which have
rather a high abscrption cross section =.p.

Te-u8  o° = 22 harns tJi = 2.7 x 10° years
1-129 " = 28 barns tJ; = 1.7 x 107 years

permlts a rather effective transmutation rate of

Tr-49 A= 7 ox 107971 4 years

t
Voeff

[-129 A =7 x 107 %s ' £, .. = 7 years

To still further improve these reactions the use of a beryllium
moderator in the form of a 5 cm wall in the cuter region of the
core has been calculated. This gave an improvement in the trans-
mutation rate of Cs-137 in the inner target region but also a
very significant increase of specific power due to the scattering
of the neutron flux in the fuel region.

The possibilities for transmutation of these two long lived fis-
sion products will be descussed further elsewhere.

The neutron flux outside the core may also be used for breeding
in a uranium blanket. The breeding ratio may be higher than 1
but the decrease of the transmutation ratio is critical and
seems to be too low for a burner reactor.

Nevertheless 1t could be useful to check these possibilities in
more detail using some of the available neutrons for breeding
in an external blanket region.

Table 4.9 summarisas the data for the reference case. It can be
shown that the transmutation rates cobtained are egual:

The results obtained are significant but rather pessimistic. To
ostimate the "profit” of the transmutation process, the hazard
index [(H) must alsoc be taken into account. From Table 4.70 1t can
e seen that the total reduction in hazard from both fission pro-
ducts equals 13.5, which is a better indication.

1,5  Comments on hazard coeftficients

 

It is perhaps valuable teo estimate the usefulness of using the
concept of hazard coefficients 1in fission product management.
Table 4.10 gives some values for 5r-490 and Cs-137. From this it
can be seen thalt in a steady state transmutations reguiring the
amount of hazardous substances 1s reduced by a factor ~ 15 in
relation to the steady beta-decay.

The amcunt of strontium-80, the most hazardous nuclide, in the
high flux burner is about the same as that found in the power
reactors after 3 years of operation.

However the most impressive result comes from considering the
end of the fission power area. Where by compared to storage
(natural decay with a combined half 1ife of 39 years) without
transmutation, the tranmsmutation case shows that the amount of
nuclides remaining will be reduced by a factor of 1000. (Fig.
L.22).

In a high flux transmutation the reduction by a factor 1000
would be achleved with 26 years in the lifetime of one reactor
generation.

4.7 Secondary processes

 

It must be remembered that the relatively high neutron flux re-
sults 1n the irradiation not only of the non-desirable radio-
active nuclides but also the stable fission products, including
the stable components of the fuel and structural material. A
very short review of these partivular processes is given here.

4,% Conclusions

The system propossd for the transmutation of °°Sr and '37Cs,
fulfills the following criteria:

1. The enerpy halance 1s positive.

2. The hazardous waste balance 1s strongly negative. That is,
the amount of hazardous material destroyed greatly exceeds
the amount of freshly produced, e.g. tritium, '°B, and the
activation products of the structural malerial.

3. The rate of destruction (ftransmutation] is approximately acz
least one order of magnilitude greater than that due to spon-
taneous beta decay.

4. The period in which a thousand-fold reduction in the hazard
can be achieved i1s the same as the lifetime of one reactor,
that is, 270 to 40 yr.

The neutron balance of the system is positive. That is, it
nermits breeding to occur along with the trangsmutation,

b. The weakest feature 1s shown in the relationship between the
probability of catastrophic release to the environment for
the transmutation operation, Py, ns, to the probability of
a similar event in the case of storage, where it 1is
desired that

Further optimisations of the system are possible.

The proposed system, a molten-salt fast reactor, while rather
exotic from @ technological point of view, is not as far re-
moved from the present state of technology as some other trans-
mutation proposals (e.g. high-flux high-energy accelerators,
controlled thermonuclear reactors) may be.

5.1 Design features and objectives

 

In this chapter a further variant of the molten salt breeder is
described.

The core 1s cooled by a cooling medium circulating in tubes. Thre
molten fusl is 1Intensively miced. It remains in the core and no
fuel other than that being drawn off for reprocessing is present
outside the core.

The unique feature of this concept 1s the use of & molten fertile
material as the cooling medium for the core.

Such a dual function for the fertile coolant results In some
unusual properties for this reactor type. The study here is
concerned with a molten chloride breeder reactor. The most im-
portant features are: (see table 5.1)

- thermal power: 2.05 GW - 1.94 GW in core + 0,17 GW 1in the

- the fuel and coolant flow concurrently (Fig. 5.1)

- the reprocessing plant is in close proximity tec the reactor
("under same roof")

- the fuel in the core, and the coolant is pumped with a velo-
city of 2 and 9 m.s™! respectively.

- structural material: possibly molybdenum along with small
amounts of other metals e.g. Ni, Fe.

The advantages of the proposed reactor are as follows -

- no separate coolant, no "foreign” cooling agent (e.g. sodium,
helium etc.) in the core which results in a more satisfactory
system with improved neutron balance.

- the fuel inventory is very small due to lack of a separate
cooling system and the small out of core inventory due to
the directly coupled reprocessing plant.

- the fuel contains only plutonium and no uranium which simpli-
fies the processing technology and removes the danger of
uranium trichloride oxidation which alsc improves the cor-
rosion properties of this medium

- the high velocities of both fuel and coolant, significantly
reduces the temperature gradients in the equilibrium state
and reduces the mass Lransport mechanisms. These aro very
sensitive to femperature gradients and play a large role in
corrosion.

However the diadvantages are numerous:

- the first and most improtant is of course corrosion. The mol-
ten chloride medium especially in neutron and gamma fields,
at high temperatures and velocities with chlorine being vir-
tually freed in the fission process from plutonium chloride
presents a very serious problem which must, and probably could
be solved.

- the most likely structural material seems to be molybdenum
alloy which among other thing gives rise to parasitic abscrp-
tion of neutrons.

- the fuel is circulated by a pump which must be located in or
close to the core which increases the corrosion problems.

- the high fuel and collant velocities result in high pumping
costs and ccould cause severe erosion.

The 20 group transport calculation gives 125 cm (8-18 m®) for the
critical radius of the core with a blanket thickness of 295 eom
(30.42 m¥). The detailed neutron halance is given in table 5.7,
The relative fluxes for rach group are to be found in tahle 1.3
for core centre and core boundary. The corresponding one group
cross sections are given in table 5.4, In Fig. 5.2 the neutron
spretra (flux per lethargy unit) are compared to that of the fast
critical facility ZPR - 3 - 48, This last spectrum is slightly
harder but the spectrum of the molten chlorides fast breeder com-
pares facourably with that of a power LMFER. From table 5.3 one
can doduce the following parameters

K = 1,305

Breeding ratio Brcore - 0,716
“branket ~ 0-070
HRtotal = 1.386

For the given core (125 cm radius) the blanket thickness was variod
betwern 75 cm oand 115 cm. Fig., 5.4 shows the variation of broeding
ratios obtained from the new transport calculations. The reaotivity
and the core brecding ratio remain practically constant in this
rankge making the adjustment of the core volume Unnecessary.

Adove 100 cm improvement of the breeding ratio by increasing the
blanket thickness gives a poor return. For example to increase

the breeding ratio from 1.40 to 1.45 requires a thickness increaso
of 70 cm or a blanket volume increase of 32%.

core size. Such acurve is very useful when it 1s required to
translate the cost in reactivity of a supplementary parasitic
absorbticn into an increase in core volume (or plutonium in-
ventory). The transport calculations used in Fig. 5.5 could
not be used to obtain the carresponding variations in breeding
ratio, rather they have been calculated from the information
in table 5.3. (assuming small core volume variation < 10% and
no important changes in spectral.

This gives

1) BRtDtal - 1.386 - 2.45 8k (breeding in core unchanged)

The effects of modifying the core composition can be evaluated
by the same method. This is arranged to avoid altering the
properties of the coolant and fuel by varying the coolant tube
diameter. The reactivity is very sensitive to this parameter.

1t can be seen that the penalty on the total breeding ratio for
the same 6K is anly slightly greater while the penalty on the

increase of plutonium inventory 1s five times less. Therefore a
reduction In the diameter of the coolant tubes 1is preferable to
an increase in coolant diameter, provided of course that an 1n-
crease in coolant velocity is admissible. This last assumption

is implicit In these calculations since the coolant density was

kept constant.

In the whole system the chlorine absorption represents 5.38%.
We have seen that the GGC-3 values are different from the more
up to date ones (ENDF/B-TITI1). On the basis of these new cross
sections civen In Fig. 5.3 (curve 6) and assuming that the re-
ference spectrum is unchanged, a computation of the one proup
corss sections ¢gives 8.40 mb instead of 6.359 mb in the core,
and 9,11 mb instead of 8.23 mh in the blanket. In this last re-
gion the spectrum is softer and the 1ncrease of cross sectlons
in the enerey range (B A 0,8 MeV) 1s almost compensated for by
the decrease at the lower energies (10 keV - 0.6 MeV]).

The total absorbtion by chlorine for the whole system is B.5/%
instead of 5.38% giving a loss of reactivity of 1.2%. This loss
could be replaced by a 1.89% increase in Pu inventory 1if a very
small decrease (0.65%) of the coolanlt tube diameter i1s accepted.
Otherwise by changing aonly the core radius a greater 1ncrease

of Pu inventory (10%) is required (fig. 5.5)
Fven with this latest data the problem of parasitic capture 1In
the chlorine 1s not dramatic and there i1s no reason to believe
that there is no need to enrich the chlorine *7Cl. This is con-
sistent with the conclusions of Nelson. Fig. 5.3 eclearly shows
the importance of the energy distribution (spectrum corresponds
to the chlorine cross section minimum (65% of neutrons are 1in

an energy range where opp <€ 5 mh). This fact was not perhaps re-
copnised 15 years ago when fine spectrum calculations were not
possible. This could explain the pessimistic conclusions of
several eminent physicists,

For the molbydenum alloy chesen (20% Mo) the reactivity penalty
(2%) is guite acceptable. However the cost could rapidly beccme
nrohibitive 1if the volume of the structural material and/or the
molybdenum content should increase for design reasons. In the
context of mure detailed design studies this polnt may become
more important than the definition of the proper chlorine cross-
spctions. It does however seem likely that the molybdenum cross
sections used in GGC-3 were overestimated.

In the simplified calculations, no core vessel was allowed for
at the core/blanket boundary but all the required information

is available - fluxes, one group cross sections etc. (Table 547,
Using the same alloy for the vessel (20% Mo) the one group ma-

Faor 19 mm thickness a value of 1.37% is obtained for loss of
reactivity which would have to bhe compensated for by an increase
of core volume of about 10% i.e. about 9 m® instead of 8.18 m?.

A better solution would be an increase in the plutonium inventory
of about 2.1% in the reference core (loss in breeding ratio

The partlial changes 1in kg or leakage are only approximate but the
total reactivity changes are evaluated directly and are therefore
more precise.

The Doppler effect in the fuel is quite negliecible due Lo com-
pensation between the capture and fission processes.

The effect of full loss of coolant is large and positive but
considerably lower than might be expected from crude calculablions
(kee changes in the reference spectrum).

in the second term the part played by the Doppler coefficient
(4.8 x 107*) is quite negligible. For + 100°C in the fuel the
loss of reactivity is - 3.8% which is very important from the
safety point of view. Compared to any kind of power reactor
(even Lthe BWR) the advantage of this kind of reactor is quite
evident.

For the Nelson (1967) value of the thermal expansion =-3.107°
instead of -6.3 x 107" one gets - 1.8% which is very close to
the Nelson result -1.5%.

This important isolthermal and pessimistic coefficient is still
negative. Nevertheless during a detailed study of this reactor
concept 1t would be necessary to check the values of the ther-
mal expansion coefficlent for fuel and coolant more carefully.
The relative value of the coolant term which is positive might
prove to be too high 1if the differences bhetween fuel and coolant
became too marked. This problem did not arise with the present
data.

where the space function is called the "fundamental mode” (solu-

homogeneous calculations based only on the cross section data of
the core,f(E) is the asymptotic spectrum which is space indepen-
dent far from the core boundary. For the same 2. energy groups
one gets: B2 = 4.08 x 107" ecm™?. Using this value a good fit of
the "exact fluxes” have been obtalned from the complete trans-
nort calculations (Fig. 5.6). The asympototic fluxes cancel for

whero R, is the extrapolated radius. By definition the blanket
saving 1s piven by

where R, is the core critical radius. The blanket saving depends
mainly on the nuclear properties of core and blanket and on
hlanket thickness. However for thicknesses greater than 60 cm
this last effect is very weak. Finally the shape and size of the
core have almost no influence on this saving. This parameter,

for this reason so important in reactor physics, will be used in
the next section for the one dimensional cylindrical calculations.

The axial blanket thickness is taken to be equal! to the radial
thickness (95 cm), and the core height as #_ = 200 cm. The criti-
cal radius of this cylindrical core has to be determined. The

two dimensional transport calculations are too expansive (and un-
safe) and only one dimensional calculetions have been made, which
is sufficiently accurate. Axial transport calculations are not re-
quired since the balnket saving is known from the spherical geo-
metry calculations. One can therefore assume the following flux
shape.

(B2 = 1.450 x 10" %cm™?)

The computation of core radius and spatial distribution have been
made with the SHADOK code (cylindrical version) by introducing
axial leakage defined by B?. Before that a first approximatiaon

is obtained by introducing the radial buckling a?, that is to

say assuming for the core only, the shype Y¥(r,E) = J, (ar}f(E)
where J_ 1s the usual Hessel function. One obtained a? = B? - g2
where the critical total buckling is 4.08 x 107" cm™? which

gives a’ = 2.63 x 107% em™? and a = 1.625 x 1072 cm 2. Then the
extrapolated radius of the cylindrical reactor is

o = 148.0 cm.

 

Finally with the previcus blanket saving we get a core radius
proper of Rg = 11/7.5 cm. The direct transport calculations with
SHADOK -code gives Ro = 118 cm: This clearliy indicates the value
of the blanket saving concept. Nevertheless these transport cal-
culations are still necessary because they give the radial dis-
tribution of fluxes and specific power over the whole system and
more detalled informations. Fig. 5.6 shows some of the radial
distributions of flux and specific power. The energy production
in the blanket is quite small (1.7% of the core power) because
no fissile materlals are present (and only fast fissions occur
in 2?%U). In practice it would be higher (say 5%) since the re-
processing process would not be able to remove all the fissile
nuclides produced even with continuous fuel (coolant) reprocessing.

The radial form factor for specific power distribution is, for
this core

Note; it would be possible to improve this coefficient by choice
of different lattices particularly the most reactive at the
peripheral region.

The axial distributicon of specific power is given with a good
approximation. If the axial mean value is unity then this dis-
tribution is:

P(Z) = 1.284 cosm %—%T—LE—W}U < 7 <100
and a5, = 0.78 for the axial form factor.

"his axial distribution i1s very close to that used by Nelson.

The critical volume is higher for cylindrical geometry 8.75 m’
compared to #.18 m?: this increase was expected.

Usually the number of energy groups required for a good defini-
tion of neutron spectrum is at least 17 for fast critical assembly
studies and 22 can be considered desirable. Therefore a 27 group
cross section set has been prepared, the code GGC-3 which allows
99 eroup calculations for a rather simple geometry has been used
for this condensation. The cross sections were produced separa-
tely for core and blanket and the scattering anisotropy was
Iimited to P+ which 1s sufficlenl for this reactor type. Most

of the GGC-3 library data were evaluated bty G G A before 1967

but some are more recent.

- Iron - evaluated from ENDF/BT data (Feb. 1963)
- Molybdenum - evaluated fraom isotopes of ENDF/BT date (July 1863)

- Plutonium 239 - evaluated from KFK -750 Resonance Nuclide
(Feb. 1969)
New data concerning chlorine absorbtion cross sections are
available at EIR (Fig. 5.2) they are obtained from ENDF/B-ITI
(Jan. 1972). Unfortunately this information came too late to
be used for the transport calculatiocons. Fig. 5.3 (curves 5 and
6) shows that the GGC-3 values were underestimated above 0.6 MeV
and overestimated between 10 keV and 0.6 MeV. The effect of this
on the reactivity is not great. Taking also the molybdenum cross
section from ENDF/B-III one can see that the GGC-3 values are
too high. (experiments made with molybdenum control rods in fast
critical assemblies could not be reproduced with ENDF/B-T which

makes a new evaluation of data necessary).

5.4 Gafety Problems, Comments

 

The molten chlorides reactor seems to be a relatively safe system
due to the following rasaons

- an extremely high nesgative temperatur coefficient of reactivity,
since during a temperature riss part of the liguid fuel 1is
pushed out of the core into a non-critical geometry buffer tank.
The dumping of fuel in case of an incident is also possible in
an extremely short time.

- 1n a more serious incident when the fuel temperature increasss
to 1500-17009C (depending on external pressure)] the fuel begins
to boil. The vapour bubbles give rise to a new and unique, very
high negative "fuel voild effect”

- the leakage of fuel to the coolant 1is probably not a serious
nroblem because the coolant is continuously reprocesced.

- the leak of coolant to the fuel for the same reason cannct
cause large problems (provided the leak remains small).

A reohbter adverse proparty of such a molten fuel reactor is the
need to inltially heat the solidified fuel in a non critical
geometry with external power. (e.g. from the electrical ¢rid).
“his problem has been fully overcome in the case of the molten
fluoride thermal reactor (Oak Ridge National Laboratory).

5.2 Corrosion of structural material

 

H.2 Ceneral criteria

 

It 1s clear that one of the most problematic areas in molten salt
rzactor technology 1s the area of corrosion. Some criteria can be
formulated as follows

- thie free energy of chlorides formation for structural materials
must be relatively low, significantly lower than those of pluto-
nium and uranium chlerides but still lower than those of the
main fission products

- the partlal pressure of the chlorides formed from the structural
materials must be rather low which corresponds to & relatively
high boiling point for these chlorides (Fig. 6.16)

- the neutron capture cross secticn for (n,y), (n,p) and n,2n)
must be low (see later)

The structural materials are in principle different for the two

typrs of core discussed.

- internally cooled, using tubes plus the effect of the coaling
i g 0 t

- externally cooled by pumping the liquid fuel cut of the core

These two variants call for different structural materials and
different reguirements

From these and other criteria the following cholces may be made
- for the internally cocled core tubes: molybdenum

- for the wall of the gspherical core, in the case of the
externally cooled reactor: graphite and berrylia.

irradiated fuel or coolant)

ac S L L 450 K3/mol C1.

The equilivbrium constant of this reaction is small and nguals
10717 g0 that this reaction is completely unimportant.

Tn the bionket zone the most dangerous reaction is connected with
uranium trichlorides (chlorine from the fission of PUC13].

 

the control of the UClR/UElz ratio in the fertile coolant might
be frasible due to the continuous reprocessing of Lhis material
togother with the control of zirconium from the fission products
oxidation state.
An additional problem comes from the fact that molybdenum has
different oxidation states +2, +3, +4, +5 and all of them have
the corresponding chlorides. (see Fig. 6.17)

Futher difficulties arise from the problem of the reactions
between metal chlorides and oxygen and water.

These reactions (for oxidation state +2) could be written in
simplified form

 

.Me C12 + H, O

5 > MeQ + ZHCI

 

Me Clz Q;Dﬁ > MeO + Cl

the metal oxides are mostly insoluble in molten chlorides which
results in a seriocus disturbance of the fuel system. From this
point of view the metallic elements could be divided into three
classes (see Fig., 06.12).

- those which are stable with H. 0 and 0,, that is the chlorides
are more stable than the oxides (e.g.éNa, Cs, Bal) and partially

Ca.

- those which are not stable with H,0 and 0., and the resulting
product is a mixture of chloride, oxychlofide and oxide (e.g¢.
Pu, U but alsoc 7Zr, 11, AL, Fe, Cr, Mn, Me - this is the most
numerous group of metals).

- those in which chlorides are converted to the most stable oxide
in the presence of H.,O0 or O, (e.g. Mo, W) metals of this class
seem to be less numercus than those in the other two classes.

This property causes the rapid elimination of traces of water or
oxygen in the molten chloride salts of Pu and U. It Is also well
xnown that traces of H,0 and 0O, have a very big influence of the
corrosion rate. Molybdenum belongs to the last class, the oxide
is much more stable than the chloride {(Fig. B.18)

This means that the traces of exygen aor even water will result in
the production of molybdenum oxide. This effect requires consider-
able further study.
65.2.3 The irradiation of molybdenum and iron in a fast high
flux reactor

The high neutron flux irradiation causes physical and chemical
changes 1n structural materials.

Molybdenum is a mixture of stable isotopes. The most
important by-product of neutron irradiation is the Tc-99 beta-

emitter with ty, = 2.1 X 10° years and belongs to the decay chain
shown here.

The diffusion rate of hydrogen from the molten fuel to the
coolant and blanket (here also UCl3 - NaCl) must also be
mentioned.

Une can assume that this melt containing hydrogen is saturated
so that the porosity of the wall (molybdenum) will play a minar
role. The most important factor is the variation in the mechani-
cal properties of the molybdenum caused by the uptake of hydro-
gen.

The problem of molybdenum corrosion in chlorine containing media
is particularly complicated by the numerous molybdenum chlorides:

MoCl,, MOCIB, MDCld, ﬂDClq (Fig. B.17)

From the carlier published data (Chasancv, 1365; Harder et al.,
19695 Taube, 1361) it appears that the problem of the chemical

state (oxidation state) in this chloride medium for the fission
product element constituent requires further clarification.

From a simple consideraticn it seems that the freeing of chlorine
from the fissioned plutonium is controlled by the fission preduct
elements with standard free enthalpy of formation up to ~ 20 KJ/mol
of chlorine, that is up to molybdenum chloride. The more ’noble’
metals such as palladium, technetium, ruthenium, rhodium and prob-
ably tellurium and of course noble gases: xeonon, krypton plus
probably iodine and bromine, remain in their elementary state
because of lack of chlorine. Molybdenum as a fission product with
a yleld of 18% from 200% all fission products may remain in part
in metallic form. Since molybdenum alsc plays the role of struc-
tural material the corrosion problems of the metallic molybdeanum
or its alloys are strongly linked with the fission product be-
haviour in this medium.

The possible reaction of UCly and PuClq with Mol

resulting in further chlorination of the actinides-trichlorides
to tetrachlorides seems, for PuCly very unlikely (AG'P00K -

- 450 kKJ/mol C1) but this is not so for UCL,.

A rather serious problem arises out of the possible reaction of
oxygen and oxygen containing compounds (e.g. water) with PuCl,
and UCly which results in a precipitation of oxides or oxychlo-
rides. The con“inouns reprocessing may permit some control over
the permissible level of oxygen in the entire system as well as
the contiinunous gas bubbling system with appropriate chemical re-
ducing agent.

Corrosion of the structural material, being molybdenum is also
strongly influenced by the oxygen containing substances, A pro-
tecbtive layer of molybdenum however, may be used on same steel
materials using electrodeposition or plasma spraying techniques.

Note that all these considerations have been based on standard
free enthalpy: but even a chance  in the thermodynamic activity
trom = 1 Lo = 0,001 which means a change in free enthalpy of
T4KkJ mnl~ ! thus appears Insigniflicant as far as these rough
calculations eo.

In the fertile material reactions also occur and the most impor-
tant are

6.4 Scme comments on reprocessing

 

Breeder reactors as 1s known form part of a breeder system which
includes not only the power reactor hut also the reprocessing
plant.

The advantages cf molten salt breeder reactors become particularly
apparent when the reprocessing plant is under the same roof as

the power reactor and when chemical separation processes take
place in the high temperature molten salt media in a continuous
cycle. From Fig. 6.2 1t can be seen that all fission products
might be classified into 3 classes.

FPA = fission products of alkali and alkali earth but also
rare earth elements which have free enthalpy of chlo-
ride formation greater than those of PUCIB.

FFS = flisslon products of seminoble metals with free ent-
halpy of formation smaller than those of PuCla.

FPE = fission products existing in elementary form because

of the low free energy of chloride formation ar
negative balance of chlorine.

Ihe separation of plutonium or Uranium form the irradiated fuel
by means of pyrochemical technigues could be carried out for
example in the following way.

Molten salt, primary phase Pu, 7 [(part of ' remains)
Metallic phase (part of FP remains)
Molten sall, secondary phase containing only Pu.

fthis is the so called metal transport process. The proposed
schematic of separation processes utilizing metal transport is
given in Fie. 6.27 and b6.22.

6.5.1 The proposal

In this type of reactor an in-core continuous gas purging of
the molten fuel which can significantly improve the safety in
an in-core accident, is possible,

A mixture of hydrogen-helium gas is continuously bubbled through
the liguid fuel in the core. The mean dwell time of the gas-
bubbles needs to be controlled and the mean transport time of
the molten components to these bubbles must also be controlled
(e.pg. 1f speed-up is desired-intensive mixing, if delay-local
addition of a further gas stream).

The alm of the gas stripping is as follows:

1) to remove the volatile fission products which in the case
of an accident control the environmental hazard. (1-131,
Xe-133, Kr-85 and precursors of Cs-137) and =2t the same
time for the thermal reactor, removal of the I-135, precursor
of Xe-135, Improves the necutren halance.

2] to control the production of delayed neutrons since most of
the precursors and nuclides of this proup are very volatile,
e.¢. + Br-I-isotopes.

3) removal of oxygen and sulphur, corntinuously (sees Chapter 7)
4) n s4tu cantrol of corrosion problems on structural materials

For the sake of a first approximation a gas flux of 30 cm’® per
sec. {(narmal state) of Hy/He is arbitrarily assumed. At 20 bar
pressure and with a dwelling time in core of 20 seconds, the gas
bubbles will only occupy a fraction of the core equal to 10°°

of 1ts volume and have little influence of the criticality, (but
the collapsing of bubbles results in a posiftive criticality
coefficient).

The system proposed for continuous roemoval of the volatile fission
nroduct from Lhe core itself has a retention time of some hundreds
of seconds only. Each reprocessing mechanism which operates out

of core is limited by the amount of molten fuel being pumped from
the core to the reprocessing plant. This amount, due to the high
capital cost of the fuel and high operation costs cannot be grea-
ter than that which gives a fuel in-core dwell time of about one
week, Even with a 1 day dwell time, that is, if after one day the
fuel goes through the reprocessing plant, no acceptable solution
to the I-131 problem is obtained since the activity of this nuclide
is only diminished by one order of magnitude. Nnly

8 direct in-core removal gives the dwell time in core as low as
some hundreds of seconds.
6.5.2 Delayed neutron emitters

 

The principal question arise out of the fact that some of the
short lived iodine and bromine {(perhaps also arsenic, tellurium)
lsotopes are the precursors of the delayed neutrons.

Table 6.4 Precursaors of delayed neutrons for Pu-239 fast fission

4 2.09 32.8 T-135, Br-90
5 0.5495 10.3
5 0.216 3.5

As other possible nuclides the following can be considered +
As-0h; Kr-492, -93; Rb-92, -94; Sr-87, -98; Te-136, -153/;
Ces-142, -143. The remocval of these delayed-neutron precursors
from the core reduces the value of R, which is lower for Pu-239
than U-235. Thus we have a problem of reaching a compromise
between an as rapid as possible removal of the hazardous I1-131,
and as long a dwell time in the core for the delayed neutron
precursors: I-140, 1-13%, 1-138, 1-137 and the appropriate
bromine isotopes.

In this case the meen dwell time of iodine in the steady state
reactor is about 100 seconds. It can be seen that the activity

of fodine for a 2.5 CW(t) reactor is of the order of only 10 kilo
curies (for seconds) activity of approx. 10% (or 103 for 1000
second extraction rate).
The gas-extractiocn also influences the other volatile nuclides.
From a very rough estimation for these molten salts (with a
small excess of free hydrogen) the following fission products
and thelr associated precursors of iodine and bromine can be
volatile at 1000°C.

In elementary form: Xe, Kr, Te (7)
In simple volatile hydrides: SrH, IH
In simple volatile chlorides: SnElz, SbCIB, NbCla, CdCl7.

This amount of finally volatile components including I, Br, Xe,
Kr amounts to appreximately half the total fission products
{i.e. 100 micromoles per second). In addition there is the cor-
responding amount of tritium (fromternz2ry fission). This amount
of all fission products corresponds to a gas volume ratio of
about 2 cm?®/s or 10 times smaller than the nostulated amount of
hydrogen flow at 30 cm’/s.

The extraction removes all short lived fission products which
are vaolatlile under these conditions. Thus not only is the re-
moval of the il1odine isotopes and the consequent reduction in
nroduction of xenon (e.g. for the atom number: A = 135, 136,
137, 138, 139) achieved but it slows down the in-core production
of Cs-13/7, Cs-138, Cs-1349, and then also barium-139

The higher components of the liquid fuel: PuClq and NaCl. The
Fuel consists of: .

- 15 mols PuCl,; boiling point 2040 K

- 85 mol% NaCl ; boiling point 1728 K

One can as a first approximation say that it would have the
“ollowing composition in the vapour phase: 5 mol% PuCly - 95 mol%
NaCl. )

The order of magnitude of vapour for pure components at a tem-
perature of about 1250 K is

NaCl ~ 5 x 107% har; Pucl, ~ 107" bar

For the PuCli-NaCl system aone assumes here a lowering of the
vapour pressure (thermodynamic activity coefficient approx. 0.1).
At the postulated volumetric flow rate of 30 cm?® H> normal per
second, the vapourized amount of plutonium is given hy:

30 cm?

- -1 _ -8
SSEI0 T TmsT 10 har x 10 = 10 mol Pu/s

 
- 1/5/176 -

This amount of plutonium is of the order of 107"% relative to
the amount of plutonium fissicned in the same time (approx 107°
mol Pu/s). Heowever, it still has to be recovered, which unfort-
unately makes the reprocessing more complicated.

Last but not least 1s the in-core gas extrection of two other
alements

- oxygen in the form of H2U : oxygen from impurities (i.e. PubC1)

- sulphur in the form of H.,S5: sulphur from the nuclear reaction:
CL (n,p) 78 ’

(see Chapter 7).

/.1 Chemical behaviour of radiosulphur ocbtained by
*°C1(n,p)?®°S during in-pile irradiation
(accordineg to Janovici, 19/75)

 

 

The rather large concentration of sulphur formed by *°Cl(n,p)?®°S
reacticn 1n the moltzn chlorides system proposed for the fast
reactor makes 1t necessary to obtain the full information on the
chemical behaviour of the radicsulphur. The most recent studies
on the chemical statzs of radiocsulphur obhtained by n-irradiation
of alkall chlorides have shown the complexity of this problem.

To obtain new data aon the behavicur of radiosulphur we have in-
vestigated the influence of the time and temperature of irradia-
tion and of post-irradiation heating on the chemical distribution
of the sulphur.

EXPERIMENTAL

— e e = g m = —

Sodium chloride ("Merck” reagent) was heated for B0hr at 2007
in an oven in vacuo. fhe dried samples of 100 mg sealed in
evacuated (10 %*torr) quartz tubes were irradiated near the core
of the "Saphir” swimming pool reactor for different periods at
a neutron flux of 5 x 10'% and 4.3 x 10'% n cm™? s” ', Reactor
irradiations were carried ocut at an estimated temperature of
1509C and -1380°0C. After irradiation the samples were kept for

B days to allow the decay of *“Na.

The method of *°S-species separallion. The crushing of the ir-
radiated ampoule was made in a special device from which the

alr was removed by purging with a nitrogen stream containing
10ppM of oxygen. Aftar crushine a gentle stream of nitrogen was
allowed to flow for about 10 min. The gases evolved were collected
in coolerd traps. The irradiated slat was dissolved in 2 M KCN
snlutioncantaining carriers of 877, CNS™, S05°%-, 8842h. During
dissolution oxygen was not completely excluded although nitrogen
gns was passed continucusly throuegh the system. The radiosulphur
found In gaseous form was determined as barium sulphate. For

the '°S-species separation the chemical method described recently
by Kasral and Maddock was used. The radicoactive samples were
counted under a thin window Gelger counter. All measurements

were made in duplicate with and without Al-absorber.

Post-irradiation heating. The sealed irradiated ampules were
heated in an electric oven at 770°9C for 2 hr or at 830°C for
about 5 min. and then cooled and crushed in a closed system under
a stream of nitrogen.

Fig. 7.1 S2- remains the preponderent fraction independent of
the irradiation time. Formation of S°- is indicated by charge
conservation during the *°Cl(n,p)3°S reaction. Alternatively it
can be supposed that reduction of sulphur takes place by capture
of electrons due to the discharge of F-centers. The presence aof
S% in this oxidation state in the lattice is no longer contested.
The precursors of higher forms may be S* as a result of an elec-
traon loss from 5%. However, the interaction of chlorine entities
formed by irradiation with radiosulphur to form species as S5C1,
sCl>7, SCl, may be an important mechanism in forming the per-
cursors of sulphate and sulphite.

During longer Iirradialions some of the sulphide 1s converted into
higher oxidised forms. This may be a consequence of radlation-
produced defects with oxidising cheracter (e.g. V-centres or deri-
vatives). It 1s possible that the concentration of defects re-
sponsible for reduction of the sulphur decreases by annihllation
when new traps are formed. The oxidation of radiosulphur with
increase of radiation damage concentration may alsc be due to the
reaction of recoil sulphur with chlorine atoms. The presence of
OH™ in the crystal must not be neglected. It has been suggested
that radiolysis of OH™ can be responsible for accelerating the
oxidising process.

Effact of post-irradiation heating. The effect of post-irraciation
heating (including melting) can be seen in Table /.1.

Comparisons between heated and unheated samples are made for
irradiatlons of 2, 12 anag 24 hr. For 2 hr irradiation, results

on samples heated at a temperature below the melting point of

NaCl are also presented. As 1is seen, on heating, a part of the
radiosulphur is found in a volatile form. The vclatile radio-
sulphur appears at the expense of 5° and higher oxidation forms.
The results show that with temperatures above the boiling point

of sulphur and above melting point of NaCl the S° and 8% and/or
5¢Lly receive sufficient kinetic energy to migrate to the surface
or even tcec escape from the crystal and be collected as volatile
radiosulphur. However, there are some differences in the 395+
chemical distribution on heating below and above the melting point
0 NaCl {experiments 2-3). It seems that for relatively short
periods of irradiation (2 hr) only the sulphate and sulphite
precursors account for the volatile radicosulphur fraction. For

a longer time of irradiation, on melting the S° value decreases

to about 2% and this corresponds to an increase in the volatile
radicsulphur (experiments 5, 7). However, a small and practically
constant yield of S° is found in the melit after longer irradiation

times. No significant changes are observed for the sulphide and
higher oxidation forms. Comparison of these results and thoss
presented in Fig. 1 shows that in the post-irradiation melted
samples the radiation damage does not have the same effect as

in the unmelted samples. Supplementary information can be cb-
tained by studying the effect of high temperature irradiation

on the distribution of the radicsulphur. It is possible that

in the molten state the active oxidising agents have a different
identity from those present below melting. The presence of oxygen
and probably sodlum oxides during melting may have a determinant
role in deciding the state of the radiosulphur.

Effect of irradiation temperature.

A compariscon of results obtained by irradiation at 423 K and

/7 K (Table 7.2) shows that the higher oxidation fraction is
lower (3%) at 77 K. As 1s seen the increased S° after low tem-
perature 1irradilation occurs at the expense of the sulphate +
sulphite and sulphlde fractions. The defects with oxidising and
reducing character formed by low Lemperature irradietion such
as F and V-centres (or derivatives] become important factors in
determining the radiosulphur behaviour.

/.2  Temperature dependence of sulphur species laccording to
Furrer, 1977)

 

Significant amounts of the order of magnitude of thousands of
npm *°S would be present as steady-state concentration in a
proposed fast breeder reactor fuelled with melten Pu/U-chlorides
diluted in NaCl. To obtain information about the chemical be-
haviour, mainly the distribution of oxidation-states, the in-
fluence of irradiation temperatures (-130 and 15°C) and the
ffects of a post-irradiation heat treatment, solid NalCl was
investigated and the results published. The subject of the
cresent note are Investlgatlions at higher irradiation tempera-
tures, especially with samples molten during irradiation.

Caperimental

Cquimolar mixtures of NaCl and KCIl ("Suprapur”, Merck) were studied
instead of pure NaCl {(m.p.B658 vs B00YC) because the irradiation
device permitted temperatures of up to 7509C only. The fTinely
crushed slat-mixture was dried in vacuc at 2509C for 24 hr and
subsequently treated with dried HCl-pas at 300YC for 24 hr in

order to remove traces of water and hydroxldes. 100 mg samples

were weighed into quartz ampoules In a pglove-box with a purified
nitropen atmosphere (07, H,0 T0pom).

In order to study the influence of oxygen from the surface of the
Si0--ampoules, parts of the samples were weighed into small cruci-
hles made of pold-foil and closed by folding the foil. The ampoules
were eovacuated to a pressure of less than 107 °mm Hg (24 hr) and
during evacuatiocn heated to 2500C for about 8 hr to remove ad-
hering traces of HCL, sealed and irradiated for 2 hr at 500, 600

or 7000C in the swimming-pool reactor SAPHIR near the core at a2
total flux of about 4 x 10'7 n ecm™® s ', The neutron-spectrum is
not well characterised but known to be rather hard.

The post-irradiation treatment followed closely the work of (8)
as described in detail elsewhere (4.5). The ampoules were crushed
at room remperature in a nitrogen atmosphere, volatile reaction
products carried by a nitrogen g¢as-stream into cold-traps cooled
with liquid nitrogen and the samples subsequently dissolved in

an exypgen-free carrier-solution containing cyanide and sulphide,
thincyanate, sulphite and sulphate as carriers. The fractions were
seporated. independently oxidized to sulphate, precipitated as
Hab o, and the activities measured with a thin-window GFl-counter.
Some experiments were made at 1509C irradiation-temperature in
order to be able to compare the CaCl/KCl-system with pure NaCl.
New irradiations of pure NaCl were carried out in order to study
the influence of the HCLl pre-irradiation treatment.
- 183 -

The data for at least 2 independent experiments at 150 and 500°C
or 4-5 experiments at /00°C for each set of parameters (pre-
irradiation treatment, gold-foil packing, irradiation-temperature)
are shown in the following table. Sulphite, sulphate and volatile
fractions are tabulated together as SX*., While the sulphite-
fraction was always less than 2% of the sulphate-content, the
volatile part showec large fluctuations, especially with samples
packed Into gold-foil, (0,20% of the sulphate content) caused

by the variations in sample surface and tightness of the package,
even 1f mechanically destroyed before dissolving. The volatile
species still remaining In the slat at dissolution, presumably

as SyCly, are immediately hydrolized to sulphate and only tao a
small extent to sulphite in the basic cyanide-carrier-solution.
The following figure shows the temperature-dependence of the
oxidation state distribution.

The experiments at 1509 on Nall treated with HCl-gas confirmed
the existing published results (4.5), which were obtained with
a slat dried in vacuo only.

The results of the investigations at higher temperatures and

with molten samples show a monotone decrease of the S™?-gspecies
and a corresponding increase of the SX*-species with increasing
irradiation-temperature. The content of 5% is influenced neither
by the pre-irradiation treatment not by the irradiation-temperature
and 1s always about 20%. Melting of the samples during irradiation
does not influence the distribution of oxidation states. The
studies at 1500C show for NaCl/KCl-mixtures a shift of about 20%
in 57°% towards hiecher oxidation-states, mainly S, compared to
pure NaCl. No influence of the pre-irradiation sample treatment
could be shown at 1508C, but it is of Iimportance for work with
molten samples. Untreated samples without gold-foil protection
showed S~ 7-levels of less than 2%. HCl-treatment increassd this
value to about 13%, an additional gold-foil protection to 26%.
Uxygen of the guartz surface in contact with the melt is clearly
significant at /7009C. The assumption that oxygen from the quartz
surface should be of importance for reactions cver the cas-phase
is not plausible, without mentioning that oxygen-levels in the
rvacuated ampoules (10°°, Hg) must be much greater but have no
significant influence, as low temperature experiments show.

8.1 Introduction
This chapter gives the results of studies on the thermal proper-
ties of the followling units.

- High flux liquid fuel core with external heat exchanger. This
core has the geometrical form of a sphericael shell (Fig. 8.1A)

- Power-breeder-core with molten fuel and external heat exchanger.
The core is spherical. (Fig. 8.108).

- Sodium/molten salt heat exchanger.

All the calculations were made in simplified form and were
intended only to rouvghly define the scaope of the prcoblems.

8.2 High Flux reactor with the core as a spherical shell

 

This reactor was designed to meet the following regquirements

al In the shell type core to achieve the highest possible flux
in having a fast spectrum requiring a relatively high power
density. Very good mixing in the fluid, i.2. a high turbulence
is a vital requirement. For this the flow rate of the fuel has
to be kept high.

bl In the central regions a thermal neutron flux is obtainded
(Beryllium coated Deuterium hydroxide as moderator). The
thermal neutron flux extends partly into the fast core which
causes a very high and locallised power density. This 1s the
reason for requiring a high fuel turbulence.

) In the termal zone having a neutron flux of approx 4x10'%n cm?s !

it is possible to transmute the most 'dangerous' fisslon products
Strontium-90 and Caesium-13/. Table 8.1 shows the most important
parameters.

8.4 The external heat exchanger

 

The most important parameter for the external heat exchanger was
selected as the volume of fuel contained in it. The decisive
factor is the minimisation of the fuel volume existing outside
the core, which influences:

- the effective specific power
(MW{th) per kg guel in the whole syster)

- the effective doubling time
- safety considerations under accident conditions.
- minimisation of the loss of delayrd neoutrons.

For this reason a simple molten salt/sodium heat exchanpger was

.5 The internally cooled reactor

 

This type of reactor, has fuel circulating in the core only, with

£
o relatively low temperature gradient of approx. 35°C and a high
heat capacity, and a high velocity coclant 9m s7! with apain & low
temperature pradient of approx. 43°C and high heat capacity. This,
coupled with the very high naegative temperature coofficiont of
reactivity results in an unusually high necative thermal and
'reactivity! stability.

Orecroase of the fuel circulation and/or coolant velocity (in the
U-tubes) results in a definite and "automatic” decrease of reaclor
power without recourse to engineered methods. This points to such
a reactor being & surprisingly stable and self regulating device.

Tho achievement of the required fuel velocity in the core seems
te reguire a forced circulation system since the rough estimate
using natural convection gives a heat transfer coefficient which
not acceptable.
Such a forced circulation system (core only) can be one of the
following types - pump installed directly in the core, pump
outside the core, an external pump with injector, a gas 1ift
pump using inert gas. Consideration of the factors involved
Uusing criteria such as reduction of the out of core inventory,
elimination of additional heat exchangers, minimisation of the

FUEL VELOCITY ms™
- 197 -

A very encouraging indication of the good temperature distribu-
tion with very small temperature gradients 1s shown in Flg.
.16 which indicates the axial bulk temperature distribution

in the fuel and in the coolant in the core.

The Fuel bulk temperature changes From 380°C at the bottom to
965°C at V4 core height and 1is 598°C at 3/4 of core h@lcht The
conlant temperature lies between 750°C inlet and 793°C outlet.
Both these small temperature gradients in the fuel and in the
coolant (fertiel material) may prove beneficlal iIn reducing
corrosion processes due to the minimizing of mass transport
pheanomena.

The stable behaviour of this type of reactor results from many

parameters. Two cof them are the velocity of the coolant and its
bulk temperature. The mean power output of the core is strongly
dependant on the velocities of both fuel and cooclant. Fig. §.17.

For a fuel vplocity of 2 mes !, when the coolant velocity falls

from 12 mes ' to 1 mes ' the coolant outlet temperature lﬁCFraSD%
from 78470 to 993°C for constant inlet temperature of 7509C. This
change of coolant velocity and its bulk temperature results in

the decrease of the mena core output from 2.088 CW(th) to 0.598
CWith) - that is approximately a factor 3! It is clear since the
lower coolant velocity results in a higher coolant cutlet tempe-
rature and lower power ocuftput we have definite negative temperature

coefficlient (power output) varying with the given coolant velocity.

[f the fuel velocity falls from 2 mes ' to 0.3 mes™ ! we again get
an important decreass of power outpulbt (see Fig. 3.18). The de-
crease in both fuel and coolant velocity results in a sharp
decrase of reactor power. This means that such a reactor can be
ronsidered as & surprisingly stable and self regulating device.
Iin the case of a sudden fall in coolant and/or fuel velocjities
the power output decreases to a safe level without intervention.

The achievement of the required fuel velocity 1in the core seems
to require a forced circulation system since Lhe rough estimate
using natural convection gives a heat transfer coefficlent which

15 too low.

Such a force circulation system (core aniy) can be one of the
following types

- pump instaliled directly 1n core
~ pump outside the core
- an external pump with iInjector

- a pas-1ift pump using inert gas (argon)
Intensive consideration of the factors involved, using criteria
such as - reduction of the out of core inventory, elimination of
additional heat exchangers, minimization of the fuel leakage,
minimization of the auxilliary power, optimisation of the fuel
flow regulation, points to an in-core pump solution. Of course
this gives rise to considerable technical problems (coaoling of
the rotor, corrosion and erosion, maintenance, neutron activation
etc. J.

The postulted fuel velocity makes 1t possible to make some cal-
culation of the heat transfer problems and also gives a feel for
the kinetics of the reactor under discussion.

It must be stressed thal these kielics studlies have no strong
physical sense and use an 1tterative approach but 1t 1s clear
that they give some useful information about the egeneral reactor
stability. (see Fig. &.19).
