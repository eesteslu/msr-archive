REMOVAL OF XENON-135 FROM CIRCULATING FUEL SALT OF THE-MSBR
BY MASS TRANSFER TO HELIUM BUBBLES

1.0 Introduction |

A pr0posed'method10 of removing XenonQiBS from the fuel salt in the
Molten Selt Breeder Reactor (MSBR) involves circuletion of helium bubbles
with the liquid fuel. Bubbles ere to be injected into the flowing stream

near the pump, and then dissolved Xenon—135‘is removed from the liquid.

" by mess transfer (combined diffusion and convection) into the bubbles.

The circulaeting bubbles are then to be removed from the liquid at the

outlet of the heat exchanger by a centrifugel separator.

Although the potentisl for Xenon-135 removel by mass transfer to
helium bubbles is high, the actual effectiveness of removal is controlled
by the surface area of the bubbles exposed to the liquid and the mass
transfer coefficient between bubbles and liquid flowing cocurrently in.
e pipe. This report deals with the.bubblevnass‘transfer rete expected
under the MSBR operating conditions, based on the information available
in the literature, and & proposed experiment to provide additional detsa.
The experiment involves simulation of the reactor flow and mass transfer
conditions through use of a glycerine solution es the liquid, oxygen as
the solute gss, and helium as-the stripping medium,

_that the effectiveness for Xenon-135 removel is sherply related to the

influenced in en importent way by the bubble stripplng effectiveness, and"
hence successful reactorfanalysis‘and design for the.MSBR depends on rether

2.1 Mass Transfer Coefficients for Spherical Bubbles

- Previous.studies on mess transfer to and from sPherical ges bubbles
have been extensive, including esnalyticel and experimental,investigations.
A brief summary'of'the‘important results is given in this section. First,
e description of the pertinent enelyticel model is presented and then a
summery of-the most recent experimental findings is given.

Figure L4 ghows the model situation of & spherical bubble of radius,

, imbedded in e stationery liguid. The bubble moves with a velocity

‘ﬁ' relative to the 1iquid. For the case of an inert gas bubble removing

& solute ges-from a liquid, the approPriate diffu51on equation is:

bubble surface because the region of important concentreation variation is
expected to be thin, and even thinner then the region of significent velo-
city veriations. Thus for such & situstion it is reasonable to represent the
velocity in~the_immediate-viginity of -the bubble surface as

u_f:us_fu;y. - (Tl

The term u, is the velocity component in the x—direction at the surface
of the sphere, possibly non-zero since the sphere is fluid, end u s is the
derivetive of the x~component of the velocity with respect to the normal
coordinate, y, and evaluated at the bubble surface.

The tengential velocity component can'bé“determined'by integrating
the continuity equation after making use of Equation (T) Thus it is
found thet

v = -g— [rluy + u's'- ¥/2)1. - (8)

"'l|l—‘

| '
In this formuletion, it is recognized that U, end U | are functions of
the position elong the bubble surface in the x-direction.
Upon use of Equetions (7) and (8) in the diffusion equation, we find

that the solute ges concentration must satisfy the relation:

Rather then proceeding with & general discussion of this equation, we now
consider two limiting cases; namely; the situation of & rigid,inferface with
us equal to zero, and secondly the case of-zerb tengentisl stress &t the
interface. The letter case certainly is relevant for gas bubdbles in a -
liquid such thet the liquid viscosity is.many‘fimes thet of the ges vis-

cosity. Thet the rigid interface situation is elso relevant constitutes

somewhet of & paradox, but it is known thet smell ges bubbles do beheve

to some extent &s rigid spheres.

It seems reasoneble to use the result given by Equation (31) in the
mess trensfer equations for sphericel particles to obtain the desired
relation for the mass transfer coefficient. The results obtained are given
for the two cases: (&) mobile gas-liquid interfece =nd (b) rigid gas-
liquid interface.

Mobile Interfeace:

The mobile-interface ‘theory for mess transfer to & single bubble
yields an explicit formula for the mass transfer coefflcient eppliceble
to turbulent conditions; namely -

on the mobile interface equations for "free-rise" velocity conditions.

The enelysis presented-must be regerded as an approximation. Random
migration of bubbles in.a turbulent liquid is certainly affected by viscous.
drag. This effect was not considered. Other important'assumptions implicit
in the analysisrare'that‘the bubble is small compered to the scale of
turbulent motion and that the bubble moves in the same liquid envelope
during the course of each turbulent "event." These effects which cause
departure of the actual turbulent bubble motion from the assumed model
probably- give rise to some attenuation of the bubble’s fluctuation-
velocity emplitude, and, hence, the results given by Equetions. (33) end
(35) are likely optimistic. That is, the bubble's turbulent fluctuation
velocity may'be'less than three times that of the liquid's fluctuation
velocity; In spite of the speculative nature of the assumptions made in
the analysis, the final equations give results which egree reasonably
well with the aveileble experimental data.

A rather'importent point Of'the preceding analysislis that the rela-
tive motion between bubbles and turbulent liquid gives rise to mass trans-

fer coefficients which are . appreciably greater than the mass . trensfer

'coefficients for "free rise" (or "free fall") flow conditions., This indi-

cation is supported by the experimental results of Harriott6 for mass .

transfer coefficients between small rigid particles carried elong by tur-
bulent liquid in & pipe. The experimental ness transfer results, ex-
pressed as the- pipeline Sherwood number (KLd/D), were correlated with

‘Reynolds number and Schmidt number by the equation g

If one uses appropriate MSBR dats (NRe = 10", No = 2880, D = 5 x 10
ftzlhr, d = 0,305 in.), Equetion (36) gives K =1.3 ft/hr. Now if one

uses the rigid-interface mass transfer relation for a bubble with diameter
equal to 0,02 in. end rising in MSBR fuel salt, it is found that the mass
transfer coefficiént for these conditions is 0.38 ft/hr.- Thus, the pipeline
mass transfer coefficient may be 3 to 4 times the value predicted for the
"free-rise" condition. Further, if an 0.02 in. diemeter bubble behaves

es & mobile~interface particle; it is noted that the pipeline mass trans-
fer coefficient as predicted by Equation (33) is again about 3.6 times the

"free-rige" bubble mass transfer coefficient.

3.0  Proposed Mess Transfer Experiment to Simulste MSBR Contact Conditions
The literature informetion on mass trensfer to gas bubbles discussed
in the previous section does not yield e firm estimate of the liquid phase
mass transfer coefficient expected for the MSBR flow conditions, Two
points need:further clerificetion; namely identification of the precise
criteria for rigid-interface and mobile-interface bubble behavior, and
determinetion of the mess transfer coefficients for bubbles carried by
turbulent liquid at the hydrodynamic conditions expected to prevail in the
MSBR. It seems that this information should be obtained by experimental
megsurements, in contrast to depending on further analytical investigation.
An experimental study of mass transfer rates in the detail to furnish
values of the liquid phase mass transfer coefficients carried out using
MSBR fuel salt would be & formideble end expensive underteking. In con-.
sidering these factors a more attractive alternative:is to attempt
determinetion of -the needed data using e suiteble fluid which simulates
the MSER situation and,ﬁhich would'nct require tests et eleveted tempera-
tures. Fo;iowing is & brief aescfiption of\a.prOPOSed experiment involving
the use of 46% gljcerol, oxygen &s the solute gas, and helium as the

ratio (db/d) Froude number (V /dbg) Schmidt number (v/D), Weber Number
(Véﬁbp/g o), plpe roughness ratio (e/d), and pipe length-to-diameter ratio
(L/d) as those.values for the MSBR. It one decides to use the same bubble
diemeter in'the model and prototype situations, the similtude reguirements
ere satisfied if the model experiment has the same pipe roughness, pipe
length, pipe diameter,‘kinemetic viscosity, Schmidt number, and kinematic
surfaece tension asrthe MSBR. The physicel'prOPerty reqnirements,of equal
kinemetic viscosity and Schmidt number cen be met approximately by using
L6% by_weight_glycerol. Figure 6 shows & plot’ofrthese physical properties
es & function of glycerolconcentration. It should be noted that this test
1iquid will not meet thewkinemetic surface tensionsrequirement. In fact the.
MSBR Weber number will be about 1.8 times thet for the 46% glycerol.

Oxygen seems to be an appropriate solute-gas to be used in the pro-
posed mass trensfer tests. The concentration of oxygen in glycerol can be
determined using the Winkler18 method and assay accnracies_of +]1 per cent
are'expected,'based on the research of JOrdeng et al.

Other physicel pr0perties needed in the evaluation of mess transfer
coefficients from the experimental data are aveilable.9 These include
the solubillty deta, oxygen diffu51v1ty in glycerol solutlons, glycerol
viscosity end density data.

Helium is recommended es & satisfactory stripping medium because of
its low solubillty in glycerol and chemical 1nertness.

The mess transfer experiment proposed 1nvolves setting up the experi-
mental system diagrammed in Figure T. Tests would be carrled out by
establishing the MSBR liquid flow rate in the test section. Helium bubbles
- would be inJected at a flow rete corresponding to that of the MSBR. Oxy-
gen concentrations in the inlet and effluent liqnids would be determined
by chemical enalysis of liquid samples.

In order to evaluate the mass transfer coefficients, it would be
necessary tondetermine the bubble diameters produced in the experimental
bubble generetor. This probably can be done by photographlc methods

The experlmental dete on liquid oxygen concentretions at the inlet
and outlet points, gas and liquid flow rates, bubble diameter, test
section length, test temperature, and Henry's lew coefficient would be

used with Equation (3) to determine the liquid phase mass transfer

4.0 Conclusions.

The study of existihg litérature on mess transfer between bubbles
and'liQuids and - the analysis presented in the previous sections permits the
following conclusions:

1. The effectiveness for Xenon-135 removal from the circulating
fuel salt in the MSER may raﬁge from about 3 to 33 per cent depending on.
the velue of liquid phase mass trensfer coefficient. The estimated
Xenon-135 removal éffectiveness;is based on the range of mass transfer
coefficients, 1 to 13.5”ft/hr;, dbtained from eveilable literature informa-
tion. - -

2. Availeble litersture ihformation provides & good basis for
estimeting mass transfer coefficients for bubbles moving at & steady.

‘velocity relative to liquid under conditions of a rigid interface and

& completely mobile interface. ‘

3. There does not exist a relisble criterion for spedifying the
type of bubble interface condition expected for a given condition.

4. The available 1iter§ture does not provide & good basis of
estimating the mass transfer coefficient for bubbles carried along by
turbulent liquid. Anelysis of this situation in approximate terms pro-
vided new reiationships-which are.in epproximate agreementVWith the date
that are available.

2. New mass transfer meesurements are proposed to_prdvidé additional
date needed in overcoming thé 11mi£ati°ns for mass transfer predictions
cited in Conclusions 3 end 4. Glycerol (L46% by weight) is recommended as
the test fluid in order to_simuiate.the MSER hydrodynemic conditions and .

 meet most of the requirements for dynemic similitude in the model end -

prototype situetions.
