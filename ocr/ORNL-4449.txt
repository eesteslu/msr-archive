Introduction

The objective of the Molten-Salt Reactor Program is
the development of nuclear reactors which use fluid
fuels that are solutions of fissile and fertile materials in
suitable carrier salts. The program is an outgrowth of
the effort begun over 20 years ago in the Aircraft
Nuclear Propulsion program to make a molten-salt
reactor power plant for aircraft. A molten-salt reactor —
the Aircraft Reactor Experiment — was operated at
ORNL in 1954 as part of the ANP program.

Our major goal now is to achieve a thermal breeder re-
actor that will produce power at low cost while simul-
taneously conserving and extending the nation’s fuel
resources. ' Fuel for this type of reactor would be
233UF, dissolved in a salt that is a mixture of LiF and
BeF,, but it could be started up with 235U or
plutonium. The fertile material would be ThF, dis-
solved in the same salt or in a separate blanket salt of
similar composition. The technology being developed
for the breeder is also applicable to high-performance
converter reactors. '

A major program activity is the operation of the
Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment. This reactor was built
to test the types of fuels and materials that would be
used in thermal breeder and converter reactors and to
provide experience with the operation and maintenance
of a molten-salt reactor. The MSRE operates at 1200°F
and at atmospheric pressure and produces about 8.0
Mw of heat. The initial fuel contained 0.9 mole %
UF,4, S mole % ZrF4, 29 mole % BeF,, and 65 mole %
7LiF, a mixture which has a meltmg pomt of 840°F.
The uranium was about 33% 235U,

The fuel circulates through a reactor vessel and an
external pump and heat exchange system. All this

- equipment is constructed of Hastelloy N, a nickel-

molybdenum-iron-chromium alloy with exceptional re-
sistance to corrosion by molten fluorides and with high
strength at high temperature. The reactor core contains
an assembly of graphite moderator bars that are in
direct. contact with the fuel. The fuel salt does not wet
the graphite and therefore does not enter the pores.
Heat produced in the reactor is transferred to a coolant
salt in the primary heat exchanger, and the coolant salt
is pumped through a radiator to dissipate the heat to
the atmosphere.

Design of the MSRE started in the summer of 1960,
and fabrication of equipment began early in 1962.
Prenuclear testing was begun in August of 1964, and,
following some modifications, the reactor was taken
critical on June 1, 1965. Zero-power experiments were
completed early in July. After additional modifications,
maintenance, and sealing of the containment, operation
at a power of 1 Mw began in January 1966.

At the 1-Mw power level, trouble was experienced
with plugging of small ports in control valves in the
off-gas system by heavy liquid and varnish-like organic
materials, These materials are believed to be produced
by radiation polymerization of a very small amount of
oil that vaporizes after leaking through a gasketed seal
into the tank of the fuel circulating pump. This
difficulty was overcome by installing a spec1a]1y de-

signed filter in the off-gas line.

Full power was reached in May 1966, and the plant
was operated at full power for about six weeks. Then
one of the radiator cooling blowers (which were left
over from the ANP program) broke up from mechanical
stress. While new blowers were being procured, an array
of graphite and metal surveillance specimens were taken
from the core and examined.

Power operation was resumed in October 1966 with
one blower; then in November the second blower was
installed, and full power was again attained. After a
shutdown to remove salt that had accidentally gotten
into an off-gas line, the MSRE was operated in
December and January at full power for 30 days
without interruption. The next power run was begun
later in January and was continued for 102 days, until

‘terminated to remove a second set of graphite and

metal specimens. An additional operating period of 46
days during the summer was interrupted for main-
tenance work on the sampler—enncher when the cable
drive mechanism jammed.

" In September 1967, a run was begun which continued

for six months, until terminated on schedule in March

- 1968. Power operation during this run had to be

ix

interrupted once when the reactor was taken to zero
power to repair an electrical short in the sampler-
enricher.

 
 

 

 

Completion of this six-month run brought to a close
the first phase of MSRE operation, in which the
objective was to demonstrate on a small scale the
attractive features and technical feasibility of these
systems for civilian power reactors. We believe this
objective has been achieved and that the MSRE has
shown that molten-fluoride reactors can be operated at
temperatures above 1200°F without corrosive attack on
either the metal or graphite parts of the system, that
the fuel is completely stable, that reactor equipment
can operate satisfactorily at these conditions, that
xenon can be removed rapidly from molten salts, and
that, when necessary, the radioactive equipment can be
repaired or replaced.

The second phase of MSRE operation began in
August 1968, when a small facility in the MSRE
building was used to remove the original uranium
charge from the fuel salt by treatment with gaseous F,.
In six days of fluorination, 219 kg of uranium was
removed from the molten salt and loaded onto ab-
sorbers filled with sodium fluoride pellets. The decon-
tamination and recovery of the uranium were very
good.

While the fuel was bemg processed, a charge of 233U
that had been made in the Savannah River reactors was
converted to UF,-LiF enriching salt in ORNL’s Tho-
rium-Uranium Recycle Facility, The enriching salt was
added to the original carrier salt, and in October 1969
the MSRE became the world’s first reactor to operate
on 2%3U. Power operation on 233U began in January,
1969, and continued until a scheduled shutdown in
June. . _ |

The nuclear characteristics of the MSRE with the
233U were close to the predictions, and, as expected,
the reactor was quite stable. One surprise was a
‘considerable increase in the amount of gas entrained in
the salt, which made the reactor power very noisy. A
- slight reduction in the pump speed eliminated the gas.
In May, a small quantity of MSRE carrier salt reserved
from the eadlier fluorination was distilled at the reactor

to demonstrate use of this process to recover LiF and
BeF, from irradiated salt. A second period of power
operation with 223U began in August, and in Sep-
tember, shortly after the end of this report period,
small amounts of PuF; were added to the fuel.

A large part of the Molten-Salt Reactor Program is
now being devoted to future molten-salt reactors.
Conceptual design studies are being made of breeder
reactors, and an increasing amount of work on ma-
terials, on the chemistry of fuel and coolant salts, and
on processing methods is included in the research and
development program,

Until two years ago most of our work on breeder
reactors was aimed specifically at two-fluid systems in
which graphite tubes would be used to separate
uranium-bearing fuel salts from thorium-bearing fertile
salts, We think attractive reactors of this type can be
developed, but several years of experience with .2
prototype reactor would be required to prove that
graphite can serve as piping while exposed to high
fast-neutron irradiations. As a consequence, a one-ﬂuld
breeder was a long-sought goal.

In late 1967 two developments established the feasx-
bility of a one-fluid breeder. The first was demonstta-
tion of the chemical steps in a process which uses liquid
bismuth to extract protactinium and uranium selec-
tively from a salt that also contains thorium. The
second was the recognition that a fertile blanket can be
obtained with a salt that contains uranium and thorium
by reducing the graphite-to-fuel ratio in the outer part
of the core. Our studies show that a one-fluid,
two-region breeder can be built that has fuel utilization
characteristics approaching those of our two-fluid de-
signs and probably better economics. Since the graphite
serves only as moderator, the one-fluid reactor is more
nearly a scaleup of the MSRE.

These features caused us to change the emphasis of
our breeder program from the two-fluid to the one-fluid
breeder. Most of our design and development effort is
now directed to the one-ﬂuld system.

Summary

' PART 1. MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR
EXPERIMENT

1. MSRE Operations

High-power operation with 233U fuel, which began in
January 1969, continued until a scheduled shutdown
on June 1. After maintenance, inspection, and the
annual test of containment, operatron was resumed in
August,

One of the prime ob]ectlves of the high-power

~ operation was to obtain a very accurate measurement of

the 2?3y g,/0, ratio. For this purpose samples were
taken after 0.5, 1.8, and 2.9% burmnup of the 233U.
Experiments were conducted during this period on the
behavior of cover gas and xenon in the fuel salt at
various fuel circulation rates. Reductants and an oxi-
dant were added to the fuel salt and numerous samples
were taken to investigate the physical and chemical
behavior of the fuel mixture. During the reactor

. operation, a small amount of fuel carrier salt, stripped

of its uranium during the fluorination in 1968, was
transferred to the distillation experiment set up in the
reactor building.

There were no significant delays in the experimental
program due to equipment problems, although re-
current plugging in the off-gas system required some
attention. An indication of the absence of serious
problems is that from January to June 1, the reactor
was critical 95% of the time. -

During the shutdown, core specimens were removed
and a different array installed, control rod drives were

* repaired or replaced, one control rod was replaced ‘and
. the off-gas lines were cleared either by heating and
blowing or (in the case of the overflow tank vent) by

replacing a plugged valve. Large amounts of data on
fission product distributions were obtzined by remote
gamma spectrometry during the shutdown and the

* subsequent startup. (The measurements during the

startup were through holes dnlled in the shield during
the shutdown.) ‘

The valves most unportant to primary containment
were tested during the shutdown, and just before the
startup the secondary containment was tested at 20

psig. Pressure tests of the fuel and coolant salt systems
at 60 psig were performed during five days of flush-salt
circulation.

The first experiments after the startup were aimed at
the behavior of cover gas in the flush and fuel salts and
its effect on xenon poisoning. Significant differences
were observed between helium and argon.

- 2. Reactor Analysis

Because some cross sections have been revised since
the physics analysis of the MSRE with 235 U was made,
the analysis was repeated using the more up-to-date
values. Reaction cross sections averaged over the neu-
tron energy spectrum and fuel volume were recalculated
for a number of nuclides in the salt, and the variation in
these cross sections with the reactor operating condi-
tions was studied. Some differences in the average cross
sections for 235U, 238U, and ?2°Pu were found. These
differences change the calculated critical 235U concen-
tration by a maximum of about 2% and thus have a
relatively insignificant effect on the interpretation of

the critical experiment. However, increases in the

average 23®U absorption cross section led to an increase
of nearly 5% in the calculated net depletion rate of
uranium for a specified fission rate in the reactor and
about a 20% increase in the plutonium production rate.

3. Component Development

The freeze flange thermal cycle test was continued
with no external damage through cycle 400, when it

~ was shut down for internal inspection and ‘minor

xi

repairs. A fluorescent dye penetrant more sensitive than
the one previously used gave a completely new pattern
of fatigue cracks and porosity indications. None of the
mdlcatrons are in the locatrons Whlch would cause
concern. .

The much improved remote gamma spectrometer
system was put into operation and performed as

planned.

In connection with the development of off-gas

“systems, a model ‘based on conventional mass transfer

concepts was developed in an attempt to describe

 
 

quantitatively the migration of noble metals in the
MSRE.

Xii

Operation of the Mark 2 fuel pump with molten salt -

at 1200°F and 1350 gpm passed 8400 hr. After the
pump tank operating liquid level was raised, void-
fraction measurements indicated there was no detect-

 

and equipment. The maximum heat generation in the
pit is about 600 kw, stemming primarily from chemical
processing wastes. The pit will be maintained at 150°F,

or below, by cooling a side stream of the nitrogen

atmosphere with a water-cooled heat exchanger. Dupli-

- cate equipment will be provided.

able quantity of gas bubbles circulating in the salt, and

- the plugging rate in the off-gas line decreased con-

siderably.

4. Instruments and Controls

Efforts to improve reactor diagnosis by noise analysis
were hampered by limitations of the pressure-measuring
system. The analytical model used in the analysis was
verified, however, and it was shown that plugging in the
off-gas line could be detected at an early stage by
analysis of the pressure noise. Continuous indicators of
pressure and neutron noise levels were installed for use
by the reactor operators. :

‘Only relatively minor maintenance and modifications
were required in the MSRE instruments and controls.

PART 2. MSBR DESIGN AND
DEVELOPMENT

5. Design

The conceptual design study of a 1000 Mw (elec-
trical) single-fluid MSBR power station is essentially
complete, -and preparatlon of a report covering the
study has begun.

Major revisions were made to the MSBR building
design to provide a sealed 134-ft-diam cylindrical
reactor building with hemigpherical top to assure
against escape of airborne contaminants during reactor
core maintenance operations. The 3-ft-thick concrete in
the building wall provides biological shielding during

“the maintenance and also serves as missile protection.

The core transport cask, now a part of the polar crane
serving the reactor building, has integral hoists for
lifting the reactor core into the cask and lowering it
into the spent-core storage pit.

As a result of a review of the resistance of the
building and equipment supports to seismic disturb-
ances, the reactor plant now rests on a concrete pad
separate from the turbine plant, In this connection, the
availability of pipe supports with vibration-damping
dashpots suitable for high-temperature operation is
being investigated.

The new reactor building layout permits a waste cell

to be provided beneath the reactor cell for storage of a
30-year accumulation of discarded radioactive materials

The primary salt drain tank was redesigned to provide
added reliability in the cooling system through use of
40 separate and autonomous circuits employing natural
circulation of a "LiF-BeF, coolant salt through 1500
tubes (¥ in. in diameter) in the drain tank and a
salt-to-water heat exchanger located outside the drain
tank cell. Heat transfer in this exchanger is by radiation,
with no direct contact between the surfaces that could
result in water entering the salt system. The generated
steam is condensed in air-cooled finned coils in the base
of a 300- to 400-ft natural draft stack, and the
condensate is recirculated. The redesigned drain tank
also serves as a 2.5-hr holdup volume for decay of
off-gases taken from the primary system prior to their
treatment and disposal. The heat load due to the gases
is about 18 Mw (thermal). ‘

The fuel salt circulating pump bowls overflow con-

‘tinuously into the drain tank. The 1213°F incoming

salt from the pumps flows downward through a % -in.
annular space at the tank wall to remove gamma heat
and to limit the maximum wall temperature to about
1261°F. The fuel salt is continuously returned to the
primary loop by four jet pumps located in the bottom
of the primary drain tank. The drain tank thus achieves
added reliability through being an active part of the
primary system.

During the past report penod an analysis of the
afterheat generation in a drained primary heat ex-
changer was initiated. Deposited noble-metal fission
products are the principal source of heat, with about 60
to 80% being due to gamma emission. Based on
extrapolation of the behavior of tellurium, which
appears to be typical of the gamma emitters, and
assuming that 40% of all noble metals are deposited on
heat exchanger surfaces, the fractional distribution of
the heat is about 60% in the tube annuli, 25% in the
intermediate shell, and 10% in the innermost  shell.
Reducing the size of the heat exchangers within the
range of interest does not significantly alter the fact
that about 90% of the gamma energy originating in the
tube annuh remams W1th1n the exchanger.

6. Reactor Physics

Neutronics calculations for the reference one-fluid
MSBR performed in explicit two-dimensional geometry
 

xiii

confirm the results obtained with the two-dimensional
synthesis technique employed in the optimization code.

Fuel-cycle calculations for molten-salt reactors both
larger and smaller than the reference 1000 Mw (elec-
trical) MSBR show a significant dependence of breeding
performance on reactor power level. Both breeding
ratio and annual fuel yield can be expected to increase a
full percentage point if power level can be raised to
2000 Mw (electrical) and nearly two points if the power
were increased to 4000 Mw (electrical).

Analysis of the effect of varying the average power
density for the 1000 Mw (electrical) MSBR shows that
the reference design, with an average power density of
22 wfcm?, is about optimum in terms of annual fuel
yield, although the conservation coefficient could be
improved slightly by increasing the power density. No
change in ‘the reference design is contemplated, how-
ever, since the selection of core dimensions is partly
based on the lifetime of the core graphite, which is
hrmted by fast-neutron damage

A new mvestlgatlon of the potential performance of a
canned-core MSBR, in which a metallic or graphite
barrier separates the core from the blanket, indicates
significantly better breeding performance than for the
reference one-fluid concept, in spite of neutron cap-
tures in the barrier. Annual fuel yields twice that of the
reference design are indicated. If feasible from other
points of view, such a concept might thus provide a
useful line of development for future MSBR designs.

Gamma and neutron heating calculations were com-
pleted for the current one-fluid MSBR design.

A digital simulation code, involving a rather detailed
model of the reactor core as well as of the primary and
secondary heat exchange circuits, has been employed to
study the response of the MSBR to various reactivity
perturbations. Frequency response calculations for the

reference MSBR at full power show no tendencies to .

instability.

- Additional calculations for various posmble configura-

tions of a molten-salt breeder experiment show that
breeding ratios near unity, with 233U fuel, could be
achieved with power levels of about 150 Mw (thermal)
and with a maximum core power density of about 100
wfem?. o ‘ ‘ 7

" The measured Value of ‘the 235U capture -to-
absorption cross-section ratio in-the MSRE is in
excellent agreement with the calculated value, providing
good confirmation of cross sections and computational
models used in MSBR design calculations. Similar
experiments are in progress for *33U.

- 7. Systems and Components Development

Pressure-drop measurements were made for four
models of the bubble generator, and contraction and
expansion coefficients were determined. Addition of a
surfactant, normal butyl alcohol, was shown to
markedly reduce the coalescence of bubbles in tests
with water. L

The steam-generator industrial program consists of
four phases that will result in the design, development,
and fabrication of a full-size, full-length tube unit for
testing in the Prototype Tube Test Stand; an MSBE unit
for testing in the Engineering Test Unit; and the steam
generator for use in the MSBE. Phase I will produce a
conceptual design for use with the ORNL reference
design of the 1000 Mw (electrical) MSBR. The salt
flows and temperatures for all operating conditions and
the steam and feedwater inlet and outlet temperatures
and pressures at full load will be specified by ORNL
based on. the requirements for the prevention of
freezing of the salt or excessive thermal cycling of the
system components. An alternative conceptual design
will be made for the same salt conditions, but without
the restrictions on the steam system. The request for
directive for the steam generator prototype tube test
stand has been deferred pending completion of the
conceptual system design description and availability of
funds.

The NaBF, circulating test loop was operated for a
total of 3600 hr during the report period to continue
the investigation of problems associated with corrosion
product deposition and with off-gas system restrictions.
Seven  tests were made with the cold finger, and
chemical analyses made of green deposits obtained
during some of these tests indicated up to 8%
chromium. No definite conclusions were reached as to
the identity of the compounds forming the deposits. An
analysis of data on impurities found in salt samples
taken during circulation of the clean -batch of salt
indicates that the solubility of iron at 1025°F is
500-550 ppm. The analytical results for oxygen and
water in the salt have a low level of confidence. A hot
trap for retention of salt mist was found to have about
a 50% efficiency using either of two different internal
arrangements. An -examination of several possible
sources indicated that emissions of acid fluid were
resulting from contamination of the system with wet air
during routine operational and maintenance activities.

A request for proposal package to obtain the MSBE
salt pumps from the United States pump industry was
completed. The package includes the specifications for
the primary and the secondary salt pumps, the pro-

 
 

posed scope of work, information required in the
proposal, and copies of the RDT standards referenced
in the specifications. Proposals are being requested from
the Bingham Pump Company, Byron Jackson Pump
Company, and Westinghouse Electro Mechamcal Dl-
vision.

Programmatic approval was received from the AEC to
proceed with the design of.the MSBE salt pump test

Xiv

stand. The conceptual system design description of the

- stand was completed and released for distribution. The
preliminary design has been started and is scheduled for
completion by November 1969.

The detail design of the ALPHA pump (for up to
30-gpm use in test loops) was completed, and the
fabrication of the water test pump was initiated. Water
tests will be performed to determine the pump hy-
draulic characteristics and to control the “fountain
leakage™ from its entrance into the pump tank to its
return to the impeller inlet.

Performance tests were conducted W1th the plpe
cutting and welding devices developed and fabricated as
modifications of equipment designed for the U.S. Air
Force by North American Rockwell Corporation.
Cutter performance tests included saw tracking and
runout determinations and machining studies on stain-
less steel and Inconel piping. Life expectancy of the
cutter blades was determined for various tools, material,
and cutter speeds. A machining technique was de-
veloped for remotely preparing J-bevel pipe ends for
welding. Some tests were started on repairing weld
defects. A 7-min color movie was prepared to show the
performance of remote maintenance operations with
the orbital equipment.

8. MSBR Instrumentation and Controls

‘The analog model of the 1000 Mw (electrical) MSBR
is being refined and expanded to include additional
nodes for more accurate simulation and more recent
data from the project for calculation of important
coefficients. The new model includes considerable
latitude for trying different control schemes and should
- be representative of expected performance over a wuler

range of power levels. -

As an adjunct to the transient snnulatlon a study is
being made of steady-state part-load plant conditions to
determine suitable profiles of temperature and flow
within the limits imposed by salt freezing, pump
capabilities, etc.

A subcontract with the Umvermty of Mlinois for a
hybrid computer study of molten-salt supercritical
steam generators has been terminated, and a final report

of the work will be issued shortly. ‘This work w_ill_.be
continued at the ORNL Hybrid Computing Facility,
which is expected to be operational early in 1970,

" 9. Heat and Mass Transfer and |
Thermophys:cal Propert:es

Heat Transfer. — New heat transfer results have been
obtained with a proposed MSBR fuel salt (LiF-BeF,-
ThF4-UF,;, 67.5-20-12-0.5 mole - %). :In the - recent
experiments a replacement test section- was used be-
cause the original one may have caused flow disturb-
ances leading to irregular axlal wall temperature pro-
files.

- The new results in the lower lammar ﬂow reglon

(Reynolds modulus, Ng,, less than 1000) and in the
upper transition and turbulent flow regions (Mg,
greater than 3500) were characterized by regular axial
temperature profiles indicative of developing flow in
the laminar region and fully developed flow in the

. transition and turbulent regions. The existence of fully

developed flow is in marked contrast with the results
obtained using the original test section, which suggested
flow transition effects extending the full length of the
tube. The axial temperature profiles, together with the
corresponding bulk liquid temperatures were employed
to derive heat transfer coefficients and Nusselt moduli
for comparison with the published correlations of
Sieder and Tate for laminar and turbulent flow,
Martinelli- and Boelter for laminar flow, McAdams for
turbulent flow, Colbum for turbulent flow, and Hausen
for transitional flow. The data agree ‘best with the
equation of Sieder and Tate in the low laminar range
and with that of Colburn in the turbulent range, Ny,
greater than 12,000,

Least-squares ﬁttmg of the data to an equation whnch
assumes the Nusselt modulus to depend on some power
of the Reynolds modulus has resulted in dimensionless
correlations of the data for Ny, < 1000 and Ng, >
12,000 with average absolute deviations of about 5%.

- No correlations could be developed in the range 1000 <
- N, < 3500 because of irregular axial temperature

profiles indicative of flow transition, the effects of
which persisted over most of the test section length.

‘Thermophysical Properties. — The effect of heat
shunting around the specimen in the present variable-
gap thermal-conductivity apparatus on the measured
thermal conductivity has been analyzed. This problem
is particularly serious for fluids having conductivities
less than 0.05 w cm ™ °C™!, which include the salts of
interest to the MSRE and MSBR. ‘A correction factor
has been derived which depends on gap spacing,
 

specimen conductivity, and the fixed thermal resistance
of the gap. Applied to the measured conductivities of
the calibration fluids water, Hitec salt, and mercury,
this correction factor brings the results into good
agreement with accepted published values. The meas-
ured conductivities of the MSRE fuel and coolant salts
and proposed MSBR fuel and coolant salts have likewise
been corrected, resulting in a small decrease from
previously published values.

Xv

Mass Transfer to Circulating Bubbles. — Shakedown '

tests of the experimental facility revealed some prob-
lems with the pump and heat exchanger, which are
being corrected. The facility incorporates a variable-area
nozzle with gas injection into the throat for bubble
generation and a bubble separator which combines
centripetal and gravitational separation with the barrier
effect of a wetted screen. A theoretical description of
the mass transfer process is under development which
assumes that a bubble moves at the local velocity of the
liquid and that the flow field near the bubble-liquid
interface is primarily the turbulence fluctuations. An
improved eddy diffusivity method is being investigated
which relates this parameter to the mean flow, concen-
tration gradient, and interfacial boundary conditions.

PART 3. CHEMISTRY
10. Chemistry of the MSRE

Refinement -of the material balance for MSRE fuel
and flush salts was effected by experimental determina-
tion of the quantity of residual carrier salt in the drain
tank. Nominal values of the uranium tetrafluoride
concentration in the fuel salt derived therefrom were
found to be in excellent agreement with the analytical
results. Comparison of the analytical values for plu-
tonium in the fuel salt with values anticipated from
nuclear data showed good agreement at the begmnmg

of 233U operations.

with exposure time. Although flush salt was not used,
metal surfaces were free of uranium. The quantity of
1351 on these surfaces exceeded previously observed
amounts by a factor of 3.5.

The surface tensions of MSRE fuel salt and flush salt
were measured using a capillary depression method in
graphite. The decrease in surface tension observed while
the fuel salt was being reduced by metallic beryllium
corresponds to a higher helium solubility and thus a
reduced bubble fraction at a given gas entrainment rate.

A study of the redox potential of niobium in the

MSRE fuel salt was initiated in tracer-level experiments
with ®5Nb and a molten mixture of LiF-BeF,-UF,.
.- Studies of the disproportionation reactions of MoF,
in LiF-BeF, mixtures were continued using mass
spectrometric methods. Appearance potentials and ioni-
zation efficiency curves for molybdenum and niobium
fluorides were shown to'imply the existence of multiple
parent species. Determination of the identity and
relative abundance of parent species remains an object
of the continuing investigation.

12. Properties of Fluoroborate
Coolant Salts

~ Mixtures of the alkali fluoroborates continue to
exhibit chemical and physical properties which favor
their use as coolants for molten-salt breeder reactors. A
program for characterizing the physical and chemical
properties of the alkali metal fluoroborates was ex-
tended to develop a broad base of information about
this important and heretofore unexploited class of
molten salts. Measurements of the properties of these

materials were extended to include experimental deter-

mination of the liquidsolid and solid-solid transition
temperatures, densities, refractive indices, decomposi-
tion pressures, x-ray crystal parameters, fuel-coolant

 mixing reactions, and equilibrium phase relationships.

Variations in the void fraction of the circulating fuel

salt using helium and argon cover gases were ration-

alized on the basis of the relative solubilities of these
“gases and the probable relation of gas-salt mass transfer

in mterfac:al tensxon on these phenomena

11. Fission Product Behavior S
A fourth set of graphite and Hastelloy N surveillance
samples, removed from the MSRE core after the June
1969 shutdown, was subjected to radiochemical anal-
ysis. No significant difference was noted with respect to
polished or unpolished graphite surfaces, and with the
possible exception of !32Te, no significant difference

Other effort was devoted to the synthesis of highly pure
crystals of sodium fluoroborate and sodium hydroxy-
fluoroborate as research materials.

Molar volumes and expansivities, derived from the
density-temperature equations of- the (molten) alkali

fluoroborates, were -cailculated at two corresponding

temperatures. Molecular polarizabilities of the five

~crystalline fluoroborates were - calculated from the

observed mdlces of refractlon

13, Physxcal Chemxstry of Molten Salts
- A study of the equilibrium phase behavior of CeF;, as

initiated as a part of a long-range study of the system
LiF-BeF, -ThF4‘CCF3 (Pllpg) Evidence of hqmd
.immiscibility was noted with mixtures which contain
low concentrations of LiF. ,

- Experiments were initiated to synthesize sparingly
soluble compounds which could act as selective ion
exchangers for the rare-arth fission products. Of some
_six oxides tested, vanadium(V) oxide and chro-
mium(III) oxide warranted further study. Measure-
ments of the solubility of thorium in thorium tetra-
fluoride were completed. The low solubility observed
indicates that the formation of thorium(III) fluoride is
unlikely. High-temperature emf measurements with
LiF-BeF, melts were applied to determine transport

numbers of lithium and beryllium ion relative to.

fluoride ion. Such measurements were used to develop a
highly precise experimental method for deterrmnatnon
of liquidus curves in fluoride systems.

' By use of a modified cell design and carefully
prepared starting materials, improved values (£0.5%) for
the specific conductance of LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %)
and its temperature variation were obtained. Electrical
conductivities of low-melting. NaF-BeF, mixtures were
measured and the temperature dependence analyzed in
terms of the zero-mobility temperature, Ty. Values of
zero-mobility temperatures were found to be similar in
magnitude to those obtamed prevxously in the hF-
BeF, system.

Viscosities of MSBR fuel and coolant mixtures were
measured at temperatures in the range 400 to 680°C
(~750 to 1250°F). The densities of these molten
mixtures ' were measured by dilatometric methods.
Expansivity of ThF, mixtures showed little change
with variations in the concentrations of BeF; and

14. Chemistry of Molten-Salt Reactor
Fuel Reprocessing Technology

The effort to develop a moltensalt fuel technology
by using reductive extraction methods was expanded to
include examination of various metal additives to
bismuth and tin for possible process application. The

addition of magnesium to bismuth resulted in the
near-stoichiometric reduction of thorium from the salt
phase. Similar results were obtained on addition of
aluminum to tin. The distributions of cerium between
the reference fuel solvent and pure tin were measured at
various thorium concentrations in the metal phase.
These values and separation factors Dy /Dyy, Were not
so favorable as those previously obtained in the
salt-bismuth extraction systems. In related experiments

the extraction of europium from the simulated MSBR
fuel solvent into an immiscible fluoroborate salt phase

was examined. Although this system was adjudged as

not feasible for application to. rare-earth separations
processes, the experimental results provide a basis for

further examination of mixing reactions between the
proposed MSBR fuel and coolant salt systems.

A small pumped loop was operated to investigate the
electrolytic reduction of thorium from a simulated
MSBR fuel solvent into molten lead and its simultane-
ous back extraction into a recovery salt. Low thorium
transport rates were encountered.

Tentative evidence which indicates that zirconium
may be separated from fuel mixtures without concur-
rent loss of uranium or thorium was discovered.
Separation is effected by precnpxtatlon of a platlmde
phase in bismuth.

15. Development ahd Evaluation of
Analytical Methods for Molten-Salt
Reactors

New parts are being fabricated for the renovation of
the apparatus for determining the oxide content of
reductive salts. As was mentioned in the last report, the
NaF trap restricts the gas flow in the system and must
be replaced. The equipment for the voltammetric
determination of U(III) in radioactive MSRE fuel was
installed in the hot cell. The one determination which
was made showed that 0.4% of the total uranium was
present as U(III). An experimental setup at the Y-12
site is being used to follow the change in the U(IV)/
U(III) ratio in a simulated MSRE fuel as either the
U(IV) is reduced or the U(II) is reoxidized. Fair
agreement for the determination of various U(III)
concentrations has been obtained by voltammetric,
potentiometric, and spectrophotometric methods.
Reduction of the fuel resulted in disagreement between
the amount of zirconium consumed and the amount of
known species reduced. This is recemng further investi-
gation. :

- To gain experience in adapting small on-lme com-
puters to electroanalytical methods, a PDP-8 computer
was programmed to operate a cyclic voltammeter. The
PDP-8 furnished all command signals to the wvoltam-
meter and computed U(IV)/U(III) ratios from the
derivative of the U(IV)-U(III) reduction wave. In other
electroanalytical studies, kinetic parameters were deter-
mined for the Ni/Ni(II} couple in molten LiF-
BeF,-Z:F, by the relaxation voltage step and chrono-
coulometric methods. «

- Evidence derived from spectral studies has shown. that
the superoxide ion, O,”, exists in" several molten
ﬂuonde solutions. This raises the possibility of radio-
lytic generation of O, from 0?' in the MSRE and
should be investigated when the hot-cell spectro-
photometric facility becomes operative. The design and
fabrication of the optical components of the hot-cell

- spectrophotometer have been completed by the vendor.

After receipt the entire facility will be installed in
Building 3019 for final acceptance tests. Some prob-
lems have been encountered with accessory equipment,
and these are being corrected. The possibility now
exists for the fabrication of a fixed-path-length window-
less spectrophotometric cell for studies of molten
fluoride salts. It has been demonstrated that stainless
steel “porous metal,” dewveloped by P. R, Mallory and
Company, will adequately hold aqueous solutions for
spectral - study. This company has agreed to fabricate
experimental batches of porous metal from Hastelloy
Tests of possible methods for the removal of oxide

from NaBF; hawe shown that BF; is ineffective but
that oxide can be removed by hydrofluorination. A

~ study is being conducted to establish the optlmum

condltlons for ox1de removal with HF.

A spectrographlc method and a polarographlc method
for the determination of bismuth in MSRP salts have
shown sensitivity hmlts‘ of 0.002 and 0.05 ppm respec-
tively. |

| PART 5. MATERIALS DEVELOPMENT

- 16. MSRE Surve:llance Program

Surve:llance samples of graphlte and Hastelloy N were
removed from the MSRE on June S5, 1969. Some
samples had been at temperature in the reactor for 2.6
years and-were exposed to fast (>50 kev) and thermal
(<0.876 ev) fluences of 1.1 X 10?*! and 1.5 X 10?!
neutrons/cm? respectively. The samples were sound,
but the metal was darker in appearance than usual.
Metallography showed some cracking (3-mil depth) of
the Hastelloy N straps that hold the surveillance
assembly together. Mechanical property tests on the
Hastelloy. N- samples show -a continuation . of. the
decrease in fracture strain with increasing fluence. The
reduction in fracture strain at low temperatures is
attributed to carbide precipitation, and the reduction at
high temperatures is due to the production of helium in
the material from the ' °B(n,&)”Li transmutation.

17. Graphite Studies

Most of the available commercial graphites have been
irradiated to a fluence of.3.8 X 10?2 neutrons/cm?.
The dimensiona! changes of all of the materials are too
large to allow during service, but two graphites show
exceptionally good dimensional stability up to fluences
of 2.5 to 3.0 X 10?2 neutrons/cm?. Density measure-
ments show that most of the volume change is
associated with changes in the pore structure. The x-ray
diffraction studies have concentrated on measuring the
crystalline anisotropy, and comparisons of these meas-
urements with observed dimensional changes during
irradiation- reveal the importance of  isotropy. The
knowledge gained from studies on commercial graphites
is being used to fabricate small experimental lots of
graphite. Suitable techniques have been developed for
sealing three very different graphite substrates with
carbon to reduce the gas permeability. The desired
permeability of <10™® cm?/sec can be obtained rou-
tinely, and experiments are in progress to ascertain how
the permeablhty changes during irradiation.

18, HastelloyN |

Several chemical modifications of Hastelloy N are
being studied in an effort to develop an alloy with
improved resistance to embrittlement by neutron irradi-
ation. Additions of 1% Ti result in an alloy containing
the MC-type carbide with good pre- and postirradiation
properties. Lesser amounts of titanium lead to the
formation of mixed MC and M,;C carbides with less
attractive properties. Alloys that contain Nb, Hf ,and Y
also look promising, with fracture strains of 4 to 23%
(compared with 0.5 to 3% for standard Hastelloy N). A
strong correlation between good postirradiation proper-
ties and formation of the MC-type carbide still holds.

The compatibility of Hastelloy N with several fluoride

- salts is being studied, with primary emphasis on the

coolant salt sodium fluoroborate. The corrosion rate is
accelerated by the presence of moisture. A pump loop
containing  coolant salt with 1500 ppm water has
corroded at an average rate of 1.3 mils/year for 4000
hr. Observations on a thermal.convection loop contain-
ing fertile-fissile salt with a bismuth appendage show
that the corrosion behavior is not affected appreciably,
although detectable quantities of bismuth moved into
the salt stream and metal impurities were extracted
from the salt stream by the bismuth. ' :
Corrosion data for Hastelloy N in steam are very
meager, and we have installed a facility in the Bull Run
Steam Plant for obtaining such information. The

facility became operational on August 7, 1969.

19. Support for Chemical Processing - -

We have deposited coatings of tungsten on plain
carbon steels and type 304 stainless steel in an effort to
obtain materials that have good corrosion resistance in
bismuth. Tungsten has a lower coefficient of thermal
expansion than these steels, and the coatings spall
during thermal cycling. We are attempting to reduce the
spalling problem by varying the coating parameters and
by using other substrate materials wnth lower expan-
sion.

The primary problem with using molybdenum for a
chemical processing plant is the ability to join this
material. Welds are extremely brittle, and the base
~ metal even becomes brittle at room temperature when
it is fully recrystallized. Early compability tests on an
alloy of iron, boron, and carbon look promising.

20. Support for Components Development )
Program

One of the primary problems in making good remote-
maintenance welds is to obtain good enough alignment
between the pieces to be welded to obtain a good root
pass. Various. techniques for obtaining better root
passes are being evaluated.

PART 6. MOLTEN-SALT PROCESSING -
AND PREPARATION

21. Measurement of Distribution Coefficients
in Molten-Salt—Metal Systems

Dlstnbutlon of actinide and lanthanide elements
between molten fluoride salts and liquid bismuth
solutions is being studied as part of the development of
a reductive extraction process for single-fluid MSBR
fuels. Equilibrium data obtained at 600°C with LiF-
BeF, -ThF, (72-16-12 mole %) show that the uranium-
neptunium separation factor is about 3, that plutonium,
americium, and californium are nearly inseparable, and
that the plutonium-curium separation factor is about
10. Studies with several rare earths showed that the
rare-earth—thorium separation factors (1 to 3.5) are not
markedly temperature dependent in the range 525 to
750°C. Selective precipitation of thorium bismuthide
from thorium—bismuth—rare-earth solutions is being
evaluated as a means of enhancing the overall rare-
earth—thorium separation factors in the reductive
extraction process.

‘Since plutonium will be added to the present MSRE
fuel salt as PuF; powder, tests were conducted to
demonstrate that powdered PuF; would dissolve
rapidly in LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %) at about 600°C. In
addition, values for the solubility of PuF; in this salt at
several temperatures were conﬁrmed

- 22. Flowsheet Analysis

Calculations have been continued on several aspects
of the flowsheet proposed for processing single-fluid
MSBR’s. Steadystate calculations indicate that isola-
tion of protactinium is feasible for a reactor fueled with
either uranium or plutonium. Approximately 90% of
the protactinium in the reactor system could be
retained in a salt volume of 200 ft . Calculations on the
transient performance of a reactor fueled with uranium
indicate that the relatiwvly large protactinium decay
tank tends to stabilize the isolation system and that the
system can be controlled by determination of the
uranium concentration in the salt entering the decay

Calculations on the removal of rare earths by reduc-
tive extraction indicate that about 24 stages will be
required in the extraction column in order to obtain
adequate rareearth removal times with bismuth flow
rates of 15 gpm and process cycle times of 30 days. The

optimum feed point location is near the top of the -

column for rare-earth—thorium separation factors be-
low 1.3 and is shifted downward as the separation
factor is increased.

Operation of the reductive extraction system for
rare-earth removal requires that only a negligible quan-
tity of ThF, remain in the salt which passes through
the electrolytic cell and returns to the bottom of the
extraction column. Calculations indicate that removal
of ThF,; from the salt can be effected by countercur-
rent contact of the salt with a lithium-bismuth stream
having a lithium concentration of 0.008 mole fraction
at a metal-tosalt molar flow ratio of 74.6. Two to three
theoretical stages will be required to maintain the
desired extent of ThF, removal.

23. Engineering Development of Process Operations

A reductive extraction system has been installed
which will allow the countercurrent contact of up to 15
liters each of molten salt and bismuth in an 0.82-in.-ID
packed column. About 200 kg of bismuth and 53 kg of

 molten salt (72-16-12 mole % LiF-BeF;-ThF,) was

charged to the system and purified by contact with H,
and H,;-HF mixtures. Attempts to operate the system
 

have revealed difficulties with deposition of iron in
bismuth transfer lines, collection of bismuth at a low
point in a salt transfer line, and external air oxidation
of the carbon steel tubing. Measures to correct or
minimize these problems have been taken.

An electrolytic cell is an important and necessary
equipment item in the reductive extraction systems for
isolating protactinium and for removing rare earths.
Experiments with static cells were carried out which
indicate that heat generation and heat transfer in cells
can be studied using ac power, which does not produce
electrolysis products resulting from use of dc power,
and that a graphite anode cannot be used unless a
means is found for removing CF, gas from the anode
surface. Several experiments were made to study the
use of frozen salt as an electrical insulator as well as for
providing corrosion protection. It was found that
frozen layers of salt could be maintained with difficulty
in the presence of high heat generation rates, and
further studies with cells of improved design will be
carried out. A facility for testing electrolytic cells under
flow conditions is being installed. Salt and bismuth will
be circulated by gas lift pumps, and measurement of the
salt and bismuth flow rates will be accomplished by
gravity-head-type orifice flow meters. Initial experi-
ments for determining orifice coefficients with bismuth
show a greater degree of scatter than is tolerable;
however, it is believed that additional experiments will
result in acceptable operation. Analysis of mass transfer
in electrolytic cells indicates that reduction of BeF,
may be encountered if cathode current densities exceed

Xix

this effectiveness which could be placed at intervals

~along a packed column seems practical, and experi-

ments to develop such devices are under way.

Axial mixing coefficients have also been measured in
a 2-in.-diam open column using countercurrent flow of
air and water as substitutes for F, and molten salt in a
continuous fluorinator. The axial diffusion coefficient
varied from 27 to 59 cm?/sec as the air rate varied from
0.28 to 5.0 liters of air (STP) per minute and was
independent of water wvelocity for water velocities as

high as 7.8 cm/sec.

0.16 amp/cm?, and experiments to check this result are -

planned.
Axial mixing in the salt phase of a salt-metal

contactor can reduce contactor performance. Axial
mixing coefficients were measured in a 2-in.-diam

~ column packed with % -in. Raschig rings using mercury
and water as substitutes for bismuth and salt. Results
indicate that the axial diffusion coefficient is 3.5

em?/sec and is essentially constant within the range of
" conditions studied. Using this value, estimates were
made of the effect of backmixing on required extrac-
tion column heights for the columns in the proposed

24. Distillation of MSRE Fuel Carrier Salt

An experiment demonstrating the high-temperature,
low-pressure distillation of irradiated MSRE fuel carrier
salt has been successfully completed. About 11 liters of
salt were distilled during 31 hr of remote operation.
Eleven condensate samples were taken at approximately
90-min intervals. The effective relative volatilities for
the major components, BeF, and ZiF,, were in agree-
ment with previous measurements, but the relative
volatilities of the rare earths '**Ce and '*7Pm were
higher than expected by approximately a factor of 30.
Although this would not prevent the use of distillation
for recovery of LiF and BeF, from waste streams,
attempts will be made to resolve this discrepancy.

25. Design Studies for Salt Processing

Natural convection heat transfer coefficients, heat
fluxes, and the thickness of the frozen salt insulating
film were calculated for a hypothetical electrolytic cell
geometry. The calculations showed that the heat fluxes
required to maintain the frozen salt insulators intact
were reasonable, although high, and that a low-melting-
point cell coolant such as sodium or NaK would be
required. Other calculations showed that the heat
transfer properties of water and mercury were similar to

‘salt and bismuth. Hence the water-mercury system

'MSBR flowsheet. It was found that while axial mixing

is unimportant in the protactinium isolation columns, it
results in impractical column lengths in the rare-earth
removal system, which operates at a high metal-to-salt
flow ratio. Calculations also indicated that axial mixing
equivalent to backflow of 25% of the salt throughput
~would result in an increase in required column length of
only 25%. Development of backflow preventers with

would be useful for mockup purposes.

Equipment is being designed and built to study the
continuous hydrofluorination and hydrogen reduction
treatment steps for purifying salt mixtures as a possible
replacement for the tune-consummg batch process
method.

It is anticipated that about 30 g of 23°Pu per

full-power week will be added to the MSRE as fuel

starting in September. PuF; powder is being procured,
and specially modified capsules are being fabricated to
permit addition of the PuF; powder to the reactor
system via the fuel sampler-enricher system.

 
 

‘Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment

P. N. Haubenreich

High-power operation with 233U fuel, already under
way for about six weeks at the beginning of this report
period, continued with only brief *interruptions for
~ another three months. After a two-month shutdown for
replacement of core specimens, studies of fission

product distributions, annual tests, and necessary main-
tenance, experimental operation was resumed. Part 1 of -

‘this report describes the analysis of the reactor be-

havior, equipment performance, and development work
directly related to the MSRE. The studies of fuel
chemistry in the MSRE, with emphasis on the behavior

of fission. products, are described in Part 3. Part 5

covers ‘the information on reactor materials that was

~ obtained from the MSRE.

AND MAINTENANCE

At the beginning of the report period, power opera-
tion with 233U fuel had been under way for about six
weeks.! Dynamics tests had shown that, as predicted,
the system was quite stable despite the small fraction of
delayed neutrons, and a good start had been made on
the 2% burnup of 233U required for measurement of
the capture-to-fission ratio. In addition to these experi-
ments, which were the primary objectives of - the
changeover to 223U fuel, the behavior and effects of
- helium cover-gas entrainment in the fuel loop were
being investigated. The volume fraction of entrained gas

in the fuel loop; which had been <0.1% during the

years of 235U operation, had risen to 0.5—0.7% during
‘the 233U startup in September 1968, With the begin-

 

A\ MSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Feb. 28, 1969, ORNL-

ning of p0wer_ operation, it was observed that small”

disturbances -in reactivity were occurring, -apparently

caused by fluctuations in the amount of gas clinging in
the core. These were investigated intensively, and late in

~ February it was shown that the gas entrainment and the

reactivity perturbations could be eliminated by re-
ducing the fuel pump speed to 1000 rpm (from the
normal 1180 rpm). - '

Reactor operation continued until a scheduled shut-
down on June 1, and, as shown in Fig. 1.1, nearly all of

- the time it was at high power.

It was observed very early that varying the amount of
helium bubbles in the fuel loop by reducing the pump

-speed had a significant effect on the '35Xe poisoning.

Early in March the power was held to 10 kw for four
days to observe the-xenon stripping transient in the
absence of helium bubbles and then to measure
reactivity effects.of changing pump speed and bubble
fraction in the absence of xenon poisoning. The
reactivity effects of reduced fluid density agreed with

the - indication of the salt level instrument on the

amount of entrained bubbles as a function of pump
speed. Also during this low-power, low-speed operation,
the temperature coefficient of reactivity was measured
again, this time without the complication of having a

gas void fraction that varied systematically with the
temperature.2 - . |

- Through  the remainder of March the reactor was
operated at 7 Mw with only two brief interruptions to
switch the fuel pump power supply. (The power was
limited to 7 Mw to permit operation at reduced fuel
circulation rate or lower temperature without getting
the radiator below 1000°F.) For the last week of the

7-Mw operation the pump power frequency was held at

 

2MSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Feb. 28, 1969, ORNL-
4396, p. 8.

58 Hz, just above the threshold for gas entrainment into
the loop, while the fuel temperature, the pump bowl
level, and the loop pressure were varied to define their
effects on the gas entrainment. '

On April 3 operation at full power, with the normal
60-Hz supply to the fuel pump, was resumed. In the
next week seven 50-g samples of the fuel salt were
taken for use in the 223U cross=section ratio determi-
nation. On April 10 a blown fuse caused an unusual
electric power failure which resulted in the fuel and
coolant salts draining. When operation was resumed a
bias in the controller for the fuel drain valve caused the

C
 

freeze plug to be abnormally short, and after three days
of salt circulation it accidentally thawed, drammg the
fuel again.

On May 4 heat removal was stopped as a precaution
when the instrument that monitors the cooling stack
for beryllium broke down. ‘

During April and May several small additions of
reductants and oxidants were made to the fuel salt. One
purpose was to observe the effects on noble metal
fission product behavior; another was to observe effects
on the physical behavior of the fuel salt. Since the
resumption of operation in September 1968, exposures
of beryllium metal in the pump bowl had been
accompanied by changes in the amount of entrained gas
in the loop and in the rate of transfer to the overflow
tank. Between. April 15 and 25, while the reactor was
operating at full power and normal circulation rate, a
different reductant, zirconium, was added to the salt to
observe its effects. As in the beryllium additions, small
rods contained in a perforated nickel capsule were
lowered into the fuel in the pump bowl. Two additions
were made: the first put 20 g of zirconium into the salt;
the second, 24 g. The gas fraction in the loop, which
was running about 0.6 vol %, decreased by a factor of 2
while the zirconium was reacting but returned to the
earlier value after the capsule was withdrawn. In the
second of the two additions the entrained gas re-
peatedly decreased and increased as the zirconium was
immersed and withdrawn. Addition of 30 g of pow-
dered FeF, oxidant had no detectable effect on the gas
fraction. In the effort to elucidate the effect of
reductants on the gas bubbles in the fuel, a device was
developed to measure the surface tension of the salt in
the pump bowl. (See Sect. 11.4.) This consisted of a
caged cylinder of graphite penetrated by various sized
holes into which salt ‘could rise. The surface tensions
measured before and one day after the addition of 5.6 g
of beryllium were quite high and practically the same.
A few days later, on.May 20, exposure of a capsule
containing both perforated graphite and small beryllium
rods produced evidence of reduced surface tension.

By this time high-power operation had bumed up -

2.8% of the 222U, and between May 21 and 27 eleven
40-g fuel samples were taken, completing the sampling
~ requirements for the measurement of the o,fo, ratio

for 233U, (See Sect. 6.3.2.)

Early in May a fuel processing experiment was carned
out in the reactor building concurrently with reactor
operations. This was - the distillation experiment de-
scribed in Chap. 24. Partly because of its importance in
the evaluation of the reactor fuelsalt inventory, before
the fluorinated carrier salt that had been held in the

fuel storage tank was transferred to the still, a con-
siderable effort was made to obtain an accurate
measurement of its volume. When the salt had first been
put in the storage tank, indications were that 2 to 3 ft*
had been transferred, but the bubbler level instrument
was now indicating 9 ft3. To resolve the discrepancy,
35. g of ®LiF was dropped into the tank to permit
measurement of inventory by lithium isotopic dilution.
Attempts to sample verified a low salt level (roughly 3
ft3). Vigorous sparging cleared . the bubbler tube of
what had been effectively a variable orifice, and it then
also indicated about 3 ft3.

Throughout the run, there had been minor dlfﬁcultles
with restrictions in the off-gas system. (See Sect. 1.34.)
In May restrictions near the fuel pump threatened to
force a premature. shutdown. A partial plug which
appeared to be near the fuel pump bowl exit developed
on May 1 to the point that the normal off-gas flow
produced about a S-psi pressure drop. This caused most
of the off-gas to bubble through the overflow tank and
out .its vent (except when the tank was being pres-
surized to recover salt that had gradually transferred
into it). Then on May 24 the vent line from the
overflow tank became almost completely plugged.

‘Thenceforth the gas was forced out through the normal

route, Although the restriction in this line had changed
little in three weeks, to minimize the chances of salt
mist completely plugging the line, the fuel pump was
operated at reduced speed through the scheduled
shutdown on June 1.

‘Power operation was concluded, as planned on June

" 1 with a manual scram of the control rods. Over the 20

weeks since the resumption of nuclear operation with
233Y on January 12, the reactor had been critical 3175
hr (95% of the time) and had produced 2548 equivalent
full-power hours.

- The two months from June 2 through August 1 were

occupied in maintenance and inspection, with the
critical path being a sequence of jobs each requiring the
use of the portable remote maintenance shield. Craft
work was held to 40 hr/week.

The first job in the shutdown was the removal of the
specimen array from the core, accomplished on June 6.

'In a departure from previous practice, flush salt was not

circulated, so that the fission product deposition after a
fuel drain might be determined.

‘During the June 1 shutdown, for the first time in the
four years of nuclear operation, a control rod had falled
to scram, and the ten days after the core specimen
removal were spent in working on the rods and drives.
(See Sect. 1.3.3.) Next the overflow tank vent line was
opened, and the location of the plug was found to be in

 
 

 

a short flanged section containing two valves. This
section was replaced and the line proved to be clear.
The remote maintenance shield was next moved to the
primary heat exchanger, where it was used with the
newly developed remote gamma spectrometry equip-
ment to map the distribution of fission products in the
heat exchanger (Sect. 1.2.5). After a week of this, a
small heater was installed remotely on the fuel off-gas
line at the pump bowl. Heat and gas pressure then
cleared the restriction there. A flange in the line was
then opened and a set of specimens removed. The shield

was moved next to the drain tank cell for replacement -

of a leaking disconnect in an air line to a pneumatically
operated valve and for gamma-scanning of the salt in a
drain tank. Finally the remote maintenance shifted
back over the reactor to complete the control rod work,
to-install a new experimental assembly in the core

(Sect. 1.3.1), and to remove specimens hung Just
outside the reactor vessel. -

Other jobs accomplished during the shutdown were
clearing the coolant off-gas line, repairing the sampler-
enricher manipulator, checking containment valves, and
replacing two valves on the off-gas sampler. -

On August 5 the reactor cell was sealed and was then
pressurized to 20 psig for the annual leak test. After a
gasket on an access port in a component coolant dome
was replaced, the leak rate was satisfactorily low. The
salt loops were then heated, filled with coolant and
flush salt, and individually pressure tested at 60 psig in
the pump bowls, with the pumps running.

From August 11 through 15 flush salt was circulated
while seven samples were taken and while experiments
were carried . out on gas entrainment in the " fuel
circulating loop. Circulation of fuel salt started on
August 16. The remainder of the month was spent in
observing effects of changing fuel pump speed and the
type of cover gas (helium or argon) on entramed
bubbles and '35 Xe poisoning.

1.2 OPERATIONS ANALYSIS

One of the primary purposes of the hlgh-power
operation .in the spring of 1969 was to determine very
accurately the ratio of captures to fissions in 233U by
measurement of uranium isotopic changes over a period
of substantial burnup. Samples were taken for this
measurement, but results had not been obtained by the
end of the report period. Operations analysis efforts
focused primarily on the behavior and effects of gas in
the fuel circulating loop. The long-term monitoring of
reactivity, heat transfer, and radiation heating con-
tinued as before. Special attention was given to reactor
heat power measurements for comparison with the total
fissions indicated by the isotopic changes. The  con-
tinuing study of the behavior of fission products in the

. MSRE, pursued previously by sampling in the pump

bowl and examination of specimens from the core, was
augmented by remote gamma-ray spectrometry on parts
of the fuel system.

_ 1.2.1 Reactivify Balance
J. R. Engel

When the MSRE fuel charge was changed from 235U
to 233U, it was necessary to establish a new zero point
from which to start the observation of long-term trends
in reactivity. The initial point was based on the 233U
critical experiment, the excess reactivity added during
the 233U zero-power experiments, and the calculated
effect of mixing the fuel salt at the end of those tests.?
Since then the reactor has operated for more than 2500
equivalent full-power hours (about 20,000 Mwhr), and
five measurements have been made of the zero-power
reactivity with no xenon present. These points are
shown graphically in Fig. 1.2. The large circulating void
fraction and variations in its magnitude contribute to
the uncertainty in. some of the zero-power data.
Uncertainties due to this effect are shown as error flags
on points obtained when the void fraction was high.
The point at 12,000 Mwhr includes a —0.06% 8k/k
compensation for a fuel drain and refill, while the
20,000-Mwhr point includes a further compensation of
+0.06% &k/k for a drain, flush, and refill. The latter
compensation was based on the assumption that the

amount of flush salt left to mix with the fuel was the

same as in similar operations with 235U fuel.

Although the apparent decrease in reactivity indicated
by the data in Fig. 1.2 did not approach the adminis-
trative limit of 0.5% 8k/k on reactivity anomaly, all
other possible indications of abnormal reactivity loss
were scrutinized. No evidence of abnormality could be
detected.

1.2.2 Reactivity Effects of Graphite
Distortion

C. H. Gabbard

In two years of power operation with 225U fuel,

while a total of about 72,000 Mwhr was being

produced, there was a gradual drift of the calculated
residual reactivity of +0.15% (ref. 4). One effect that
was expected but had not been included in the
reactivity balance calculation was dimensional changes
in the core graphite due to fast-neutron irradiation. The
type of graphite used in the MSRE undergoes changes
as shown in Fig. 1.3. The result is that the distribution
and the amount of fuel salt in the core change both
from the graphite volume changes and from the bowing
and displacement of the graphite stringers. The changes
as the hundreds of graphite bars bow in various modes
due to the nonuniform flux distribution are quite
complex, and only recently has a computer program
been developed to describe the situation in detail.
During this report period, calculations were completed
on the reactivity effects of these density changes as a
function of integrated power; the results are shown in
Fig.1.4. : e

" Calculations using either the upper or lower limits of
the graphite damage data indicate a long-term positive

tion using the upper graphite damage curves is caused

by the positive slope of the graphite damage curve at
low neutron exposures. This says that the stringers
deflected inward at low values of integrated power and
squeezed fuel out of the core; then as the integrated
power increased, the central stringers began to deflect
outward, bringing fuel back into the central region of
the core and increasing the reactivity. Conclusions

based on these calculations are that the gradual upward
drift in reactivity over the 72,000 Mwhr of 235U
operation was probably not due to graphite distortion,
but that during the 233U operations a positive drift of
001 to 0.02% &kfk per 10,000 Mwhr should be
produced by this effect. '

1.2.3 Gas in the Fuel System
R.C.Steffy  J. R. Engel

Near the end of the last report period® we began to
develop some interesting information about the be-
havior of circulating, undissolved gas in the fuel loop.
We found that relatively small variations in fuel pump
speed had dramatic effects on the gas void fraction,
both in the pump bowl and in the loop. The investi-
gation of this behavior and of its effects on xenon
poisoning continued throughout this report period.

 

SMSR Program Semiann. Progr. R_ept. Feb. 28, 1 969, ORNL-
4396, pp. 11-16.

The mechanism by which gas bubbles are drawn into
the fuel loop is evident from an examination of Fig.
1.5. The jets of salt from the spray ring, impinging on
the surface of the salt pool, carry under copious

~ amounts of the gas that fills the upper part of the pump

tank. At normal pump speed (1190 rpm) about 50 gpm
of salt is discharged into the bowl from the spray ring,
and another 15 gpm flows up around the shaft. This salt
flows back into the circulating loop through the ports
below the volute, carrying with it any gas bubbles that
may be in the salt at this depth. If the pump speed is
reduced, the velocity of the jets and the downward
velocity of the salt in the pool -are reduced, thus
reducing the amount of gas at the suction ports.
Consequently the rate of gas ingestion into the loop is a
function of pump speed. (As might be expected, salt
level in the pump tank also affects ingestion rate.)

J. H. Shaffer pointed out that dissolution of cover gas
in the fuel salt can have a significant effect on the
amount of circulating voids for a given rate of gas
ingestion. For a relatively soluble gas (like helium), a
small fraction of ingested gas at the fuel pump suction
may completely dissolve by the time the circulating

fluid reaches the reactor core. For a gas that is much
less soluble (like argon), the same void fraction at the
pump suction may lead to circulating voids all around
the loop. This effect can be shown (see below) to be
highly dependent both on the gas solubility and on the
size of the bubbles that are ingested. Since dissolution
of the cover gas would tend to force into solution in the
salt any xenon carried by the gas, substantial effects on
xenon poisoning could also be expected. '

- Observed Variations in Void Fractions. — The differ-
ence in pressure between the two bubblers (Fig. 1.5) is
an indication of the average density of the fluid in the
2-in.-deep horizontal zone between the bubbler dis-
charge points. With the pump off, the density is that of
the salt; the reduction when the pump is turned on is
proportional to the volume fraction of gas bubbles in
the zone. Figure 1.6 shows the observed variation in the
~void fraction in the bubbler zone as a function of pump
speed for two different cover gases, helium and argon.
Data are shown for both flush salt and fuel salt with the
equivalent of 3 in. of pure liquid above the zone. These
data show that there is no measurable difference
between helium and argon in a given salt. However,
with both gases the void fraction appears to be }ugher in
fuel salt than in flush salt. -

Figure 1.7 shows void fractions observed in the 100p
at the same times as the pump bowl observations in Fig.
1.6. The fractions with flush salt in the loop were
obtained by the only quantitative indicator available
with the reactor subcritical, namely, the level change in

the pump bowl as gas displaces salt from the loop into
the bowl. The measurement is of the volume of gas

'ente'rin,g the loop; the fractions were obtained by

dividing by the total volume of the loop and so

‘represent averages around the loop. The precision of

this measurement is equivalent to +0.05 to £0.10 vol %
voids. With the reactor critical, the reactivity balance
provides a more precise measure of the void fraction in
the reactor core.  The points for fuel salt in Fig. 1.7

“were - measured this way. A distinction between them
‘and  the flush salt points is that the fuel points are

nuclear-weighted averages in the core while the flush
salt points are averages of what may be a widely varying

fraction around the entire cu'culatmg loop mcludmg the
‘core.

- The data with flush salt and helium cover gas support
all previous experience with this combination; that is,
there are no circulating voids at the normal maximum
fuel pump speed of 1190 rpm. However, when the

pump speed was increased by only 55 rpm (by

temporarily supplying the pump from a diesel-electric
generator operated at 63 Hz) voids dld appear that
extended at least partway around the loop. Both the
absence and presence of voids were verified by pressure-

 
 

 

release expenments which provade a go no-go in-
dicator.®

‘The loop void fraction was significantly higher with
fuel salt in the loop than with flush salt, and with either
salt the void fraction was higher with argon than with
helium. Comparison of the results in Figs. 1.6 and 1.7
shows that all four combinations of salt and cover gas
follow the same general pattern. The threshold pump
speed for the appearance of bubbles in the loop
depends on both the salt and the cover gas, but in all
cases voids begin to appear in the loop when the void
fraction between the bubblers is around 10%. '

Although fuel pump speed ‘appears to have the

strongest effect on the circulating void fraction, changes

in other system parameters (salt temperature, overpres-

sure, and pump bowl level) also have detectable effects. -

As described in Sect. 1.2.4, evidence of these effects
was obtained by neutron noise analysis during a series
of experiments in March.

Cover Gas Solubility Effects on Bubbles. — As salt
containing bubbles of gas moves-around the fuel loop,
the volume fraction of the bubbles changes with the
pressure due to the compressibility of the gas. Some of
the gas also transfers from the bubbles into solution in
the higher-pressure parts of the loop and back out in
the low-pressure sections. Effects of changes in the
dissolved cover gas around the loop were neglected in
the mathematical models used heretofore to describe
xenon behavior in the MSRE. But as indicated by the
differences between helium and argon described above,
cover gas solubility can have an important effect on
- bubble behavior. Xenon poisoning must also be af-
fected. Therefore during this report period development
was started on a mathematical model including cover
gas solubility effects.

As a first step in the development we calculated
equilibrium bubble fractions for helium in fuel salt as a
function of pressure for various total amounts of
helium in the salt. Results shown in Fig. 1.8 are for four
different helium levels corresponding to salt saturated
with helium and containing 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.5 vol %
bubbles at 20 psia (the normal pressure in the fuel
pump bowl). Effects of surface tension were included in
the calculations and account for the differences be-
tween 1-and 10-mil bubbles.

 

" B1f there are no bubbles anywhere in the circulating salt, the
gas pressure in the voids in the core graphite does not change
appreciably during the course of a pressure experiment. When
voids are present, the effect of extra gas delivered to the
graphite during the pressurization stage is quite evident.

LIQUID PRESSURE (psn:l)

Fig. 1.8. Equilibrium Void Fraction of Helium in Molten Salt
as a Function of Liquid Pressure for Various Equilibrium Void
Fractions and Bubble Diameters at 20 psia.

Note that each of the curves bends under if suffi-
ciently high pressure is attained in the fluid. This
implies that, given the conditions at 20 psia, there is no
void fraction which can exist in equilibrium with the
fluid at pressures above the pressure at the bend. All of
the helium would tend to go into solution if the fluid
pressure were above this maximum. For a given initial
void fraction, the maximum fluid pressure at which
voids can persist is dependent on the initial bubble
diameter. Smaller bubbles at 20 psia will be over-
powered by the surface tension effects at lower fluid
pressures than will larger bubbles. The fact that
everywhere below the maximum pressure, the equilib-
rium void fraction is a double-valued function of
pressure is explained as follows: With large void fraction
and large bubbles, the partial pressure of the gasin the
bubbles is near the liquid static pressure, and the partial
pressure of gas in solution is the same. For the same
number of bubbles, if the void fraction is reduced to a
very small value, the diameter of the bubbles is also
reduced to a small value, and the pressure in the
bubbles due to surface tension effects is large. Most of
the gas atoms are in solution with this reduced void
fraction, and the ‘partial pressure in the liquid is also
high; thus, another equilibrium condition. Actually the
conditions represented by the lower line do not
represent a stable equilibrium. A slightly smaller void
fraction would tend to decrease and disappear due to
the large surface tension effects; a larger void fraction
would tend to grow to the upper equilibrium line. The
importance of this line is that it represents the smallest
possible stable void fraction which can possibly exist
with the two postulated conditions (number of bubbles
and total number of helium atoms).

LIQUID PRESSURE (psia}

Fig. 1.9. Equilibrium Void Fractions of Helium and Argon
with Equal Void Fractions at 20 psia as a Function of Liquid
Pressure.

The effect of differences in gas solubility is apparent
in Fig. 1.9, in which the equilibrium lines for argon and
helium are drawn. The solubility of argon in molten
fluorides’ is about a factor of 10 less than the solubility
of helium. Obviously very little of the argon would be
forced into solution even under conditions in which all
of the helium would be dissolved.

- Although the calculation of equilibrium void fractlons
contnbutes to an understanding of the gas behavior, it
is necessary to include rate effects in the description of
the situation in the MSRE fuel loop. In the MSRE loop,
salt is suddenly pressurized from 20 psia to about 70

‘psia in going through the pump. Its pressure decreases
as it flows through the heat exchanger, piping, and
reactor vessel until it returns after about 25 sec to the
pump suction at 20 psia again. This was represented in
“an approximate manner in simplified calculations whose
results are shown in Figs. 1.10 and 1.11. In the
calculations . for Fig.  1.10 the salt was assumed to
contain 1.5 vol % helium bubbles at 20 psia. At time
zero it was instantaneously pressurized to 70 psia, after
which the pressure decreased linearly with time to 20
psia after 25 sec. Initial bubble sizes (at 20 psia) of 1
mil and 10 mils were considered. In both cases the
number of bubbles was assumed to remain fixed, and a
-mass transfer coefficient of 4 ft/hr was used. For these
conditions the larger bubbles would retain their identity
-all the way around the loop, first decreasing in size,

then increasing as some of the gas dissolves and then.

comes back out at lower pressure.. The small bubbles,
on the other hand, would all disappear in 5 sec. The
helium . driven into solution “from the small bubbles
could evolve from the liquid again as the pressure
dropped; at what point and how this would occur
would depend on nucleating conditions.

Figure 1.11 shows the difference between helium and
argon for a set of assumptions similar to those used for

tions in Molten Salt When Subjected to Varying Liquid Pressure.

Fig. 1.10. (The mass transfer coefficient for argon was
taken to be 3 ft/hr; for helium, 4 ft/hr.) Because of the

~ low solubility of argon, the amount of gas in the

bubbles changes very little; the bubble size (or void
fraction) simply reflects the step mcrease and gradual
decrease in pressure. .
Although the foregoing ca'lculations involve many
assumptions and approximations, they do show the
reason for the different behavior of helium and argon
cover gas in the MSRE. They also indicate that it is
possible with helium for a significant fraction of the gas
entrained at the pump suction to be driven into
solution before the salt reaches the coreé (about 12 sec
after leaving the pump). The size of the entrained
bubbles is quite important. In the MSRE, where there is
undoubtedly a spectrum of bubble sizes, it is possible to

 
 

 

have small bubbles going into solution while larger
‘bubbles are growing.

Effects on Xenon Poisoning. — During nuclear opera-
tion cover gas bubbles will also contain ! 3%Xe, and the
entrainment and dissolving of various amounts of cover

gas will affect xenon stripping and concentration in the

fuel salt. Some preliminary experimental information
about  this relationship was obtained in March, and
additional, more detailed, data were being collected at
the end of the report period. Since the circulating void
fraction as a function of pump speed is reasonably well
known, it is possible to extract the void fraction effect
on xenon from the pump speed and variations in the
net reactivity. Figure 1.12 shows the results obtained in
March with helium cover gas and the reactor at 7 Mw.
The poisoning at zero void fraction is probably not
single-valued because zero voids exist with helium at
any pump speed below -about 1000 rpm and large
changes in fuel flow rate below this threshold would
affect the results. The data shown at zero void fraction
are for a pump speed of 1000 rpm. There is con-
siderable uncertainty in the data points where the void
- fraction is near 0.2 vol %. This is due to the extreme
sensitivity of void fraction to pump speed and of xenon
poisoning to void fraction. It was not possible to
maintain the precise control over pump speed that
would have been required to define these points
accurately. There is, however, no doubt that the xenon
poisoning at intermediate void fractions is greater than
at either higher or lower void fractions. Description of
this behavior will provide a severe test of the mathe-
matical model that is being developed for xenon
poisoning in the MSRE.

1.2.4 Diagnois by Noise Analysis
R. C. Stefty

A convement means of momtormg changes in ‘the
volume of gas in the core subject to compression during
nuclear operation is the power spectral density of the
inherent noise in the neutron flux.® This technique is
especially useful when the reactor is at high power,
where concurrent changes in xenon poisoning tend to
mask the direct reactivity effect of shifts in the fuel
void fraction. It can also be used to measure. small
changes at very low void fractions, which the reactivity
balance and pump bowl level changes are not sensitive
-enough to detect.

Fig. 1.12. Effect of Core Void Fraction on Xenon Poisoning.
Late in March the effects of fuel pressure, tempera-

ture, and .pump bowl level on circulating void fraction
were observed using neutron noise - analysis. These

“variables were changed one at a time, and the neutron
‘noise was recorded after each change. So that the tests

would be performed with about the same void fraction
as was present in a similar series- of tests performed
previously with the 235U fuel loading,® the fuel pump
was operated at a low speed (1040 rpm) and with
helium cover gas, giving a void fraction between 0.05
and 0.1%. The pressure noise remained relatively
constant during these tests. The neutron power spectral
density averaged between 0.6 and 1.4 Hz was found to
decrease by a factor of 10 when the reactor outlet
temperature was changed from 1190 to 1225°F, to
decrease by 25% when the fuel pump level was
increased from 53 to 61%, and to increase by a factor
of 2.3 when the pump bowl pressure was raised from 3

‘to 9 psig. The changes in spectral density are thought to

reflect changes in void fraction caused by each of these
parameters. (Spectral density is believed to be propor-

- tional to the square of the void fraction, at least in the

void fraction range of 0.05 to 0.1%.) Changes in pump

- bowl level, although not an accurate measure of voids at
 these low fractions, appeared to be in general agreement

with the noise analysis indications.
As described -in Sect. 4.1, confirmation of the
significance and usefulness of noise analysis led to the

- development and installation of two strip-chart re-
- corders in the reactor control room: one displaying the
magnitude of the neutron noise in a band around 1 Hz;

the other, the pressure noise in a similar band. After its
installation early in May, the neutron noise monitor was
observed to respond as. expected to changes in void
fraction produced by pump speed changes. When the
overflow tank vent line became plugged late in May, the
pressure noisc monitor began to show changes indic-
ative of increasing restriction in the off-gas system
about one -day before the new restriction became
detectable by the measured pressure drop.

1.2.5 Fission Product Distributions in
Fuel System

A.Houtzeel  R.Blumberg  F. F. Dyer

The technique of remote gamma-ay spectrometry
developed at the MSRE'® was used to study - the
distribution of fission products in the fuel salt and fuel
off-gas systems. Prior to the June 1 shutdown, portions
of the aiming and collimating systems were redesigned
and built, a hightesolution Ge(Li) detector was pro-
cured, and a 4096-channel analyzer with automatic data
recording equipment was leased. (This equipment is
described in Sect. 3.1.) Because of delays in. delivery
and shakedown of the equipment, calibration with
known sources in mockups of the MSRE equipment
was deferred until after this report period. Large
amounts of data were obtained during the June-July
shutdown and the ensuing startup (over 200 spectra
during the shutdown alone). Although the reduction of
the data to absolute quantities of fission products had
to await the calibration, some very interesting informa-
tion on relative amounts and distributions of ﬁss:on
products was derived. |

The first scans were taken on the overﬂow tank vent
line in an effort to determine the location and nature of
the plug that had deweloped shortly before the shut-
down. Eighteen. spectra taken along the line showed
predominantly noble-metal fission products, with a

_concentration at the entrance of the flow control valve.
It turned out that the plug was not there, however, but
in the inlet of the hand valve and was largely carbo-

- naceous material rather than fission products. .

A main target of the shutdown Spectrometry was the

~primary heat exchanger Because of the urgency of

-removing the core specimens, starting repair of the
control rods, and replacing the pluggéd vent line, the
heat exchanger scanning did not start until 30 days

after the end of power operation. Then about a

hundred spectra were recorded in less .than a week

ORNL-4344, pp. 36—40.

11

Most were taken along the center line (at 2-in.
intervals), with perpendicular traverses at two locations.
With the same setups of the remote maintenance shield,
some 20 spectra were recorded on the fuel line from the
heat exchanger to the reactor vessel.

‘Twenty spectra were recorded along the flexible
section -of the fuel off-gas line near the exit from the
pump bowl about five weeks after the power had been
shut down. A week later data were obtained on the
gamma spectra from a drain tank containing fuel salt.

Spectra were recorded on magnetic tape and analyzed
on the IBM 360 computer using the GAM-SPEC 3
program written by the ORNL Mathematics Division.
This versatile program has several analysis options; the

~output usually chosen was an 8-ft-long plot on graph

paper of counting rate vs channel number. The com-
bination of a 1.9-kevresolution crystal, a 4096-channel
analyzer, and the long graph permitted resolution and
identification of the very large number of peaks coming
from the mixture of fission products. Without the
calibration data it was possible only to determine
relative amounts of the nuclides, but this could be done
rather accurately for a large number of nuclides.

In both the off-gas lines the major fission products
were mostly '°3Ru, '°6Ru, '2°Te, *27Cs, and *SNb,
with smaller amounts of *21],132] and '4%Ba-'4°La.
Some interesting comparisons were apparent. For ex-
ample, comparison of the relative concentration of
'03Ru (halflife 1.01 years) with that of !'37Cs
(half-life 30.0 years), tzikmg into account the difference
in their fission yield, indicated that the chances for a
196Ru atom to deposit in the off-gas line are of the
same order of magnitude as for a *37Cs atom. By the
same token, **Nb (half-life 35.0 days) seems to have
less chance by almost one order of magnitude for
deposition in the off-gas line than > Ru (half-ife 39.8
days). This deposmon probablhty is presumably a
complex function of the volatility, transport capability,
and halflife of both the detected isotope and its
precursors.

In the heat exchanger and fuel-salt line primarily
1311 1321 103Ru 106Ru 129']:'e and 9SN'b were
found. There was no trace of '*7Cs. In contrast with
the composition in the off-gas line, here S Nb seems to
be more abundantly deposited than '°3Ru (agam
taking the fission yield into account). The deposition of

~ fission products varied considerably along the center

line of the heat exchanger. For example, ? Nb concen-
trations varied by a factor of at least 3. The highest
readings were found in the vicinity of the vertical baffle
plates.

 
 

 

‘Toward the end of the shutdown, four holes were
drilled through the shielding to permit gamma spec-
trometry during operation. One hole was over the
primary heat exchanger, one over the off-gas line near
the pump bowl, one over the off-gas line between the
particle trap and the charcoal beds, and one over a fuel
drain tank. During the startup, gamma spectra were
obtained over the off-gas line near the pump and from
the heat exchanger at reactor powers of 7.5 kw and 5.5
Mw. Although it was necessary to install a lead
attenuator below the collimator for readings at high
power, good spectra were obtained in which it was
possible to identify a host of nuclides including some
very short-lived ones.

Preparations were made to cahbrate the apparatus
with collimator inserts of different sizes, using a
25-curie 1'% Ag source. Results of the calibration
were to be used to obtain absolute values for amounts
of fission products observed in the MSRE.

- '1.2.6 Salt Transfer to Overflow Tank
J. R. Engel

In the last report! ! we described the relation between
indicated salt level in the fuel pump bowl and the rate
at which salt transfers to the overflow tank. Those data
were taken with the fuel pump running at full speed
(1190 rpm) with fuel salt and helium cover gas. They
showed that the minimum transfer rate was 1 to 2 Ib/hr
at low salt levels and that the rate increased rapidly as
the indicated level increased above about 58%.

"Additional data were obtained in August when the
fuel loop was operated under a variety of different
conditions. Because of an apparent zero shift in the
level indication, we have not attempted to make a
direct comparison between the two sets of data.
However, the recent data show that the transfer rate
depends on fuel pump speed and salt type as well as on
the indicated level; there appears to be no difference
associated with the choice of cover gas between helium
and argon.

Data taken at full pump speed gav a minimum
transfer rate of about 1 Ib/hr with flush salt and 1.5 to
2 Ib/hr with fuel salt. They also showed that the
threshold level for more rapid transfer was higher for
flush salt than for fuel salt by the equivalent of about 1
in. of liquid. Data taken at lower pump speeds with fuel

salt showed a decrease in transfer rate with decreasing
speed; the lowest rate was 0.7 Ib/hr at 800 rpm. These
observations are consistent with. the concept of
“foaming” in the pump bowl.!! (This particular foam
appears to have a high liquid fraction — possibly as high
as 50%.) It appears that the current 233U fuel salt is
more susceptible to this effect than either the flush salt
or the 235U mixture. No explanatlon for this difference
has been developed.

- 1,2.7 Coolant Salt Flow Rate
C. H. Gabbard

Since the adoption of the revised value'? of the
coolant salt heat capacity in 1968, reactor heat balances
have given 8 Mw as the maximum power of -the
MSRE.!? Observed changes in uranium isotopic ratios
have indicated, on the other hand, that the maximum
power is actually only about 7 Mw (ref. 14). In an
effort’ to resolve this difference, we reviewed the heat
balance calculation and concluded that if there is a
significant error it must be in the coolant salt flow rate.

The coolant salt flow rate is measured by a calibrated
venturi flowmeter connected to two NaK-filled differ-
ential pressure cells. A detailed review of the original
calibration of the venturi disclosed two errors.

1. The salt density used in predicting the characteristics
with salt from the water calibration data is dlfferent
from presently accepted values.

2. The ﬂowmeter ‘vendor erroneously used a spemﬁc

gravity of 12.6 rather than 13.6 in converting from
inches of water to inches of mercury differential
head. (The value of 12,6 is applicable in the
common case of a mercury manometer with water
legs above the mercury.)

These two errors were corrected in the MSRE flow-
measuring system by changing the output of one of the
amplifiers in the flow transmitter and by changing the
density correction coefficient in the computer. The net
result was not a decrease, but an increase of 2.9% in the
indicated coolant salt flow rate and a sumlar increase in
the calculated heat balance power. '

The possibility of error in the two differential
pressure cells canrnot be easily checked, since the range

check requires that the salt lines between the cells and
the venturi be cut. (This will be checked after the final
shutdown of the reactor.) After the coolant salt fill in
August, the zero readings of the two cells were checked.
Cell FT-201-A was correct, but FT-201-B was reading
about 10% high. Records showed that both cells
originally read the same with salt flowing but that
FT-201-B had drifted down while FT-201-A remained
constant. The only convenient adjustment was the zero
adjustment, and this had been set up to make FT-201-B
consistent with FT-201-A at full salt flow. Since full
flow exists during normal power operation, the zero
offset on FT-201-B has no effect on the heat-balance
power.

1.2.8 Radiation Heating
C. H. Gabbard

Reactor Vessel. — The temperature differences be-
tween the reactor inlet and the lower head and between
the inlet and the core support flange continue to be
examined for any indication of sedimentation buildup
within the reactor vessel. Table 1.2 shows the tempera-
ture differences for the present report period as
compared with the previously reported data. As seen in
the table, there was an additional slight increase in these
temperature differences over the previous data. Al-
though there appears to be a slight increasing trend, the
increase is within the data scatter and cannot be taken
as an indication of sedimentation. The increase between
runs 14 and 17 was believed to be the result of the
higher neutron leakage associated with the 33U fuel.

1.2.9 Service Life
C. H. Gabbard

‘Thermal Cycle History. — The accumulated effective

thermal cycle history of the various components sensi- -

tive to thermal cycle damage is shown in Table 1.3.
Based on the original calculations, the design life of the
fuel system freeze ﬂanges is 93% consumed. However, a
test flange in the Freeze Flange Thermal Cycle Facility
has exceeded 400 combined heating and fill cycles, and
the design life of the MSRE flanges can be extended on
the basis of this test.

Atticle I-10 of the 1968 ASME Nuclear Code gives a
procedure for relating the number of test cycles to the
allowable life. Since the test flange and test conditions
are the same as in the MSRE and since the stress
calculations indicate the test cycle is somewhat more
severe, the allowable life can be obtained by applying

only the statistical variation factor of 2.6 to the number
of test cycles. A preliminary draft of RDT Standard
RDT E2-1 “Design of Nuclear Vessels” gives a similar
procedure with a slightly more conservative factor of
3.1. Using 400 completed test cycles and the factor of
3.1 gives an allowable life of 129 test cycles or a factor
of 4.3 increase in the calculated life. If the design life of
the MSRE flanges is extended by the factor of 4.3, the
allowable cycle life will have been only 22% consumed.
Thus the proposed future operation of the MSRE will
not be limited by the freeze flange cycle life based on

-the results of the Freeze Flange Thermal Cycle Facility.

Stress-Rupture Life. — The stress-rupture life of the
reactor vessel was recently reviewed to determine if the
operation of the MSRE would be limited by the
possibility of stress-rupture cracking. The stress-rupture
life after significant irradiation was originally predicted
to be at least 20,000 hr,!5 which was believed to be
adequate for the desired operation. However, this
20,000 hr has now been exceeded, and a reevaluation of
the rupture life has been completed.

The reevaluation!® has indicated that the reactor can
be operated for at least another year with an acceptably
low probability of stress-rupture cracking. Although

_there are uncertainties in.the stress-rupture data, the

analysis is believed to be conservative, because at the
low stress levels of interest in the MSRE the rupture life
is theoretically less affected by irradiation than was
assumed in the analysis, and because the analysis was
based on the combined primary and secondary stress
levels. In the MSRE the secondary stresses are generally

7 1.2.10 Heat Transfer
C. H. Gabbard

~.There have been no explicit measurements of the
overall heat transfer coefficient of the main heat
exchanger since the end of 23*U power operation, but
the heat transfer index at full power and full pump
speed continues to be a sensitive indicator of the
heat-exchanger performance. (The heat transfer index is

defined as the ratio of reactor power to the temperature

difference between the fuel leaving the reactor and the

coolant leaving the radiator.) The average values of the

heat transfer index were 0.0406 and 0.04051 Mw/°F
for runs 17 and 18 respectively. These values are within
the 'scatter of past data’” and indicate that no

detectable loss in performance has occurred since the
beginning of power operation in 1966.

1.3.1 New Irradiation-Specimen Array
for Core . .

C. H. Gabbard

A new irradiation-specimen array was designed, fabri-
cated, and installed in the reactor core for exposure
during run 19 (ref. 18). The new assembly, shown in
Fig. 1.13, contains several specimens for studying
fission product deposition and four graphite capsules
containing uranium-bearing salts to measure the
capture-to-fission ratio of 2*3U. The design of the
specimen array is con51derably different from the
assembly of graphite and Hastelloy N metallurglcal
specimens which it replaces. The specimens are cylin-
drical and are loosely contained in a cage of three

vertical Hastelloy N rods. All but the bottom specimen,
which is pinned to the cage at the bottom, are free to
expand or contract as needed and are held down by the
weight of metal parts at the top. A new basket assembly
was fabricated from 2-in. OD, 0.062-in.-wall control-
rod-thimble material. (The perforated sheet previously
used for the basket was not available.) Near the center
of the basket, most of the wall was cut out to minimize
the neutron spectrum distortion at the uranium cap-
sules. |

The uranium samples consnst of two long capsules
containing a mixture of 232U and 22®U and two short
capsules containing 234U and 23%U. One additional
capsule of each type was prepared for the development
of salt recovery and analytical procedures at the end of
the experiment. The UF, mixtures are in an NaF-ZrF,
carrier salt that was selected so that any contamination
by the reactor fuel or flush salt could be detected by a

lithium analysis. Each capsule also contains a set of flux -

and temperature monitors. The capsules were sealed by
welding the ends of two concentric molybdenum rings
which were brazed to the graphite body and cap.
Hastelloy N and graphite specimens are included for
fission product deposition studies. A direct comparison
of the deposition on Hastelloy and on graphite will be
obtained under identical exposure conditions. The
effects of surface finish, salt velocity, and turbulence
will be studied for both graphite and Hastelloy N. A

specimen of pyrolytic graphite was included to deter-

mine the permeation of fuel salt into the graphite both

 the previously abandoned capsules' ®

parallel and perpendicular to the layer planes of the

graphite. The top specimen will expose a series of
electron microscope screens to a trapped gas pocket.

1.3.2 Salt Samplers
A. 1. Krakoviak

During ‘this report period the fuel sampler-enricher
was used 82 times for the wide variety of samples and
additions tabulated below:

23

10-g salt sample for routine analyses

50-g salt sﬁmple for 233y o./a, experiment .21
50-g salt sample for oxide analysis 1
8-cc salt sample in freeze-valve capsule 10
15-cc gas sample in freeze-valve capsule 16
‘Special capsule for surface tension determination 3
Zirconium rods in nickel cage 2
Empty nickel cage ' 1
Nickel cage containing Fer in plastic bag 1
Enfiching capsule containing 233UF4-LiF 3

Seven of the 10-g salt samples were of flush salt; the
others were of fuel salt. All sampling attempts were
successful except one 50 sample which was taken
when the fuel pump was operating on the variable-speed
motor-generator at a speed of 980 rpm: the salt level
was below the window in the capsule. On all subsequent
50-g samples, the fuel pump speed was increased to

1165 rpm during sarnplmg, thus raising the actual salt
level: in the vicinity of the sampler cage by the

entrammcnt of more gas in the salt. This indicated that
were essentially in

the same position in the sampler cage and continued to
restrict full insertion of sampling ladles. Operations for
this period brought the total use of the sampler-enricher
to 144 uranium additions and 505 sampling operations
(including Zr, Be, Cr, and FeF, additions to the fuel).

‘The main problems encountered during this report
period were associated with vacuum pump No. 1 and
the two flexible containment membranes (manipulator

boots) between the manipulator and the main contain-

ment box (area 3A) of the sampler.
Repeated vacuum pump motor outages (due to
overload) resulted in minor delays in sampling. Im-

- shown the scram time increasing from 0.85 sec shortly

after the January maintenance to 0.95 sec in May.
(Delay time and acceleration assumed in the MSRE
safety analysis correspond to a 50-in. scram time of 1.3
sec.) At the end of the run, assembly 3 was being used
as the regulating rod because it seemed to have less

- backlash than the other two assemblies, which made it

better suited for certain dynamics tests. On the June 1
shutdown scram, rods 1 and 2, which were at 43 in.,

* dropped, taking the reactor subcritical. Rod 3, at 35.4

proper oil levels in the vacuum pump seemed to be the

cause of these outages. High pressure (>15 psia) in area
1C is normally vented to the auxiliary charcoal bed
through a line bypassing the pump. Apparently high

pressure in area 1C was vented through the vacuum

pump instead, thus carrying over a large portion of the
oil into the holdup tank and off-gas line downstream of
the pump. On one inspection the pump was practically
empty of oil, with no evidence of external leaks. On the

second pump inspection, the pump contained approxi- -

mately 2 qt more than normal inventory. Apparently
the previously lost oil drained back into the pump
during subsequent operation. Pump operation is now
satisfactory, and the latest oil level check was normal.

The inner boot (in contact with the manipulator) was
replaced three times due to leaks during this report
period. Boot failure apparently occurred when a con-
volution in the plastic boot was pinched between two
negative-pressure-support rings as the manipulator was
retracted. These metal rings can fall out of their
convolutions only if the boot is distended by a positive
pressure; the rings then are no longer in neat parallel
planes which fold easily but instead are at various angles
and will pinch the boot when the manipulator is
retracted with mild force.

During the report period the coolant salt sampler was
‘used to take four 10-g samples, bringing the total to 73
No operating difficulties were encountered.

~ 1.3.3 Contro! Rods and Drives
M. Richardson . R.C. Steffy

The No. 3 control rod and drive assembly, which had
been worked on in January 1969 (ref. 20), operated
satlsfactonly until June 1, when it failed to drop during
the manual scram scheduled to end the run. Routine
scram-tlme tests from full withdrawa! (50 in.) had

 

20M5R Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Feb. 28, 1969
ORNL-4396, pp. 26--27.

in., dropped 1.4 in. and hung. The clutch was then
engaged and the rod driven in 2 in., after which it
dropped when scrammed.

During the cooldown after the fuel drain on June 1,
each of the three rod-drive assemblies was tested by
measuring scram times from starting positions ranging

from 2 to-50 in. at 2-in. intervals. The 504n. scram

times, which had been used previously as the primary
criterion for acceptable performance, were all less than
1.0 sec. Drop times at lower starting points, however,
showed abnormalities in assemblies 3 and 1. The plot
for assembly 3, shown in Fig. 1.14, shows abnormal
drag between 25 and 40 in. The plot for assembly 1
indicated a similar, though less severe, drag around 15
to 20 in. In' addition to the scram times, data on
position vs' time during scrams from 50 in. were
recorded on magnetic tape for later analysis (see
below).

When the drive unit (V-1) was removed from as-
sembly 3, it appeared to be in good shape except for
slight roughening of the air tube. The flexible rod (R-4)
was pulled, and although there was no external evidence
of damage, it was set aside and the spare rod (R-3)
installed in its place. Drive V-1 was reinstalled in
assembly 3 after the air tube had been polished.

During the January—May operation, the fine position
synchro transmitter and the position potentiometer on
the drive unit (V-3) in assembly 1 had become
inoperative. After the drive was removed to repair
them, test drops (without a rod) showed high drag
around 20 in. The spare drive (V4) was then installed
in its place. (Rod R-1 remained in assembly 1.) -

Assembly 2, consisting of drive V-2 and rod R-1,
showed no unusual ‘drag, but the position potenti-
ometer was giving a noisy signal. Therefore the drive
was removed, the potentiometer replaced, and the drive
reinstalled in July.

Induced activity in the drive units was not too high
for direct maintenance after removal. Maximum radia-
tion levels were 600 millirems/hr at contact at the base
flange of the drive housing after removal. The induced
activity in the removed rod was so high that close

examination was postponed. (Rod R-3, which had been
removed in September 1966 after 8000 Mwhr of
operation, was still reading in July 1969 over 20 r/hr at
18 in. from a short exposed section.)

After all three assemblies were reinstalled in  the
reactor, incremental rod drops were again performed.
The scram time vs starting position for each rod showed
no regions of excessive drag. Tests were performed first
with the core cold (400°F) and then hot (1200°F),
with all rods dropping slightly faster with the system
hot. All drop times were less than 0.95 sec with the
system cold and 0.85 sec with the system at 1200°F.
The data from the hot test of assembly. 3 are shown in

17

Fig. 1.14 for comparison with its earlier performance.
Plots for the other two assembhes were within O 04 sec

of that for No. 3.

In an effort to prov1de a quick testing procedure that
would not require numerous rod drops, yet would
reveal regions of abnormal drag, a procedure developed
for the EGCR was renovated. The output from the

position potentiometer is amplified and transmitted by
wire to the main ORNL area, where it is passed through
a filter with. a 5-Hz time constant to remove trans-
mission noise, digitized at 2000 samples/sec, and stored
on magnetic tape. The data are then sent to the IBM
360 computer for smoothing and analysis by a program
especially developed for this purpose. This procedure is
activated during a rod drop from 50 in. to give about
1800 data points during the drop, from which velocity
and acceleration are computed. Analysis of a record of
assembly 3 before repair showed a region of near-zero
acceleration between 26 and 40 in., in good agreement
with the incremental drop test results shown in Fig.
1.14. After reinstallation, ail three assemblies were
tested, and all showed reasonably constant accelerations
of 10 ft/sec? or more.

As a result of the experience with the control rods
during this period, monthly testing was made a require-
ment. During the startup in August the rod per-
formance was quite satisfactory.

1.3.4 Off-Gas Systems
A. I. Krakoviak

As in the past, partial plugging at various points in the
fuel and coolant off-gas systems caused some problems
in operation. Restrictions appeared in some. places
where they had not been detected before, but counter-
measures proved effective, and there was no serious
interference with the - expenmenta] program of the
reactor.

Throughout much of the operation from January
through May there was a detectable restriction in the
fuel off-gas line at its exit from the pump bowl. In
January and February it was perceptible for about six
weeks before it suddently blew out while the normal
offgas flow was being forced through it during the
routine operation of recovering salt from the overflow
tank (“burping” ‘the overflow tank).2! On five other
occasions in the next nine weeks the pressure drop
became noticeable, but each time it blew out when the
overflow tank was burped. On May 1 it reappéared, and
it remained detectable through the June 1 shutdown.
The restriction caused most of the pump bowl purge gas
flow to bubble through the overflow tank except when
the overflow tank was being pressurized to push
accumulated salt back to the pump bowl. Then on May
25 the off-gas line from the overflow tank became

almost completely plugged, and it became necessary to

turn off the overflow tank bubbler flow most of the
time. Thereafter all the pump purge gas was forced out
through the off-gas line from the pump bowl. This
situation caused some inconvenience during the burping

18

operation, but by reducing purge flow to the pump .

bowl at these times, the operation could be done
without exceeding 15 psig in the pump bowl. :

Five times between January 22 and May 12, a
restriction -appeared in the fuel off-gas line downstream
of the 4-in. holdup pipe and upstream of the line to the

auxiliary charcoal bed. Each time it was cleared by

venting the fuel pump through the drain tanks and then
pressurizing downstream of the restriction. Helium at
35 psig was used the first four times, but on the last
time this pressure was not sufficient. When 60-psig
helium was used, the restriction blew clear, and it had
not recurred at the end of the report period.

-During April the inlets of the two main charcoal beds
then in service became restricted, and the two standby
beds were valved in. After the pressure drop built up in
these also, the water level around the beds was lowered,
and the installed heaters were used to heat the
steel-wool-packed inlet sections. A backblow was used
at the end of the heating cycle to clear each bed. During
the valving operations involved, the stem or stem
extension on the inlet valve to one bed (MCB-2A) broke
with the valve in the closed position. Repairs were not
attempted because of the high radiation level at the
valve and the sufficiency of the other three beds. The
inlet of the auxiliary charcoal bed showed increased
pressure drop in May, and a forward blow with helium
was not very effective in clearing the restriction.

The pressure drop through the particle trap began
increasing noticeably, and by May it reached 0.7 psi.
(When originally installed in January 1967, the pressure
drop was less than 0.1 psi.) The reserve half of the
bed,?? which had been valved out up to this time, was
put in service in parallel on May 14, lowering the
pressure drop to 0.1 psi or less. Temperatures reflecting
fission product heating indicated that nearly all the gas
was flowing through the fresh bed.

- The restrictions in the fuel off-gas system affected the
fuel drain on June 1. To minimize outflow of radio-
active gases when the core access flange is opened, the
fuel system is normally flooded with argon in place of
helium. Because the restrictions in the off-gas system
would limit the gas purge flow during this operation,
argon flow into the pump bowl was started before the

 

22 8R Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Feb 28, . 196 7,
ORNL4119, pp. 42-45.

drain so that as the salt drained, the reactor vessel
would be filled with argon. The drain rate was slowed,
particularly toward the end, by restrictions in the gas
lines which slowed flow of gas from the drain tanks to
the loop and out through the auxiliary charcoal bed.
Pressures during the drain disclosed that a restriction

“had deweloped in the gas line entering fuel drain tank 2

(FD-2). This was cleared by heating the tank to 1250°F
and applying 60-psig helium. A similar but lesser
restriction in the gas line at the other drain tank was
partially cleared during the fuel system pressure test in
August by heating the tank to 1250°F and flowing
helium from FD-2 (at 50 psig) to FD-1 (at 2 psig). ‘

During the shutdown in June, when the overflow tank
vent line was scanned with the remote gamma spec-
trometer, an unusually strong source was observed at
the air-operated valve, about 33 ft downstream from
the overflow tank. Flanges were opened, and pressure
observations showed that the restriction was in the
flanged section containing both the air-operated valve
and a hand valve. This section was removed to a hot

~ cell, where polymenzed hydrocarbons were found to be

blocking the hand valve inlet port. A replacement
section containing an mr-operated valve but no hand
valve was installed.

The restriction at the fuel pump bowl exit was not
reamed out as had been done on three earlier occasions.

 Instead the 2-kw heater that had been built for this

purpose?! was installed remotely on the pipe as near to

the pump as possible and connected to spare power and

thermocouple leads in the reactor cell. The pump tank

furnace heaters and the new heater were turned up to
bring the section of off-gas line to near 1200°F; then
gas pressure was applied to blow the restricting material
back toward the pump bowl. The heater was turned off
but left connected so that it could be used again
without reopening the reactor cell. No evidence of the
restriction appeared during the August operation.

- The set of specimens exposed in the off-gas holdup
volume since April 1968 was removed during the July
shutdown for examination. Results are described in
Sect. 11.3.

Temperatures in the fuel off-gas system responded to
changes in fuel pump speed during high-power opera-
tion, indicating changes in the stripping rate of the
short-lived gaseous fission products that produce most
of the heating in the holdup volume and the particle
trap. These indications agreed with the changes in
stripping rate inferred from the !3*Xe poisoning.

The off-gas sampling system was used during the
report period to remove nine concentrated samples,
using the refrigerated molecular sieve absorber and
sample - bombs. In addition the system was used
extensively for ondine determinations, including hydro-
carbons. (See Sect. 11.3.) Recurring restrictions in the
inlet valves to the off-gas sampler were repeatedly
cleared by forward blowing with 60-psig helium. During
tests in July, the inlet block valves would not shut off
tightly and were replaced. During the startup in August
it was again necessary to blow out restrictions at the
inlet to the sampler.

The coolant off-gas system was relatively trouble free
until the last week in May, when restrictions developed
in the pressure control valve and the -back-diffusion
preventer at the discharge end of the line. During the
June shutdown the filter was replaced, the pressure
control valve and a nearby check valve were cleaned,
and the back-diffusion preventer was removed. All four
components were coated with an oily substance (pre-
sumably from the pump) which impeded the off-gas

19

flow. The coolant off-gas system operated satisfactorily

during the August startup.

13.5 C*ompon‘ent Cooling Sysiem
P. H. Harley

No significant operating difficulties were encountered
with the component cooling pumps after the brazed
tubing systems for circulating oil to the two pumps
were replaced with welded systems in August 1968.

Component cooling pump 1 had operated con-
tinuously for 4031 hr before it was shut down for
programmed maintenance in June 1969. The oil (which
was about a gallon low) was changed, the oil filter was
replaced, and the drive belt (which had apparently been
slipping) was tightened. The other pump (CCP-2) was
used when operation resumed and by the end of August
had operated 500 hr. :

- 1.3.6 Containment andVentllatwn s I
P.H. Harley ' N

From March through May the air mleakage into the -

reactor cell (at —2 psig) gradually increased from 17 to
28 scf/day, still well below the permissible 75 scf/day.
The cause of the increase could not be determined.

After the maintenance period in June and July, the

reactor and drain-tank cells were leak tested at 20 psig
as required annually. The leak rate at first was over 300
scf/day. -After leaks were located and stopped in a
10-in. valve bonnet and a 12-in. inspection port, the
rate was down to 150 scf/day (65% of maximum
permissible at 20 psig). When the cells were first pulled
down to —2 psig after the pressure test, the apparent

inleakage rate displayed its usual behavior under these
conditions: high at first, then decreasing to an ac-
ceptable value in five days, and leveling off in about
nine ‘days at a low value. This was attributed to the
vaporization of water in one of the cells raising the
humidity until condensation produced a steady state.
Coincident with the leveling off of the apparent cell
inleakage, 0.4 gal/day of condensate began to collect at
the cooler in the cell atmosphere recirculating system,
indicating an in-cell water leak of that magnitude,
probably from one of the space coolers. After the
condensate began - to appear, the measured inleakage
rate was 20 scf/day..

- During  the reactor shutdown all block valves and
check valves on lines entering the primary containment
(fuel salt and fuel off-gas systems) were leak tested.
Five measurable leaks were located and repaired. Two
check valves in gas purge lines to the fuel sampler-
enricher, which leaked 35~70 cc/min at 20 psi at first,
were leak-tight after in situ flushing with trichlorotri-
fluoroethane (Freon TF) solvent. Two - solenoid-
operated block valves on the off-gas sampler inlet line
were replaced, as was a check valve on an intermittently
used purge line into the off-gas system.

The fan normally in use on the ventilation stack
required replacement of broken belts on two occasions
and a rough bearing once, all in July and August. In
each case stack flow was maintained by the standby
fan. After the cell maintenance was completed, all three
parallel banks of stack roughing filters were replaced as
a routine measure to reduce pressure drop. Dioctyl
phthalate tests of the three banks of high-efficiency
particulate filters gave efficiencies of 99.995%,
99.993%, and 99.985%. (ORNL standards require
99.95% or better.) =

. Stack activity releases continued to be quite low
Over the six-month report period total particulate
activity released was <0 .22 mc, and measurable gaseous
activity amounted to 12.5 mc. Of the latter, 7.0 mc was
released when a section of the fuel overflow tank vent
line was removed, and 3.0 mc was released dunng the
removal of specimens from the core. There was no
spread of conta_rmnat_lon_ outside contamination zones
during the maintenance work except for one occasion
when a small amount was spread in the high bay around
the reactor cell during the removal of core sampling
tools. No significant exposure of personnel resulted.

o 17?;.7 Heaters and Electrical System
T. L. Hudson

The operation of the heaters continued with only one
failure during this report period. About a 30% drop in

 
 

 

 

 

current on heater H-102-5 on the fuel line between the
heat exchanger and the reactor occurred in the early:
part of August. After a resistance check indicated that
one of the three heater elements had failed, the spare
heater elements were placed in service.

In April a failure of a fuse on the primary side of the
MSRE main power transformer resulted in the loss of
voltage on one of the transformer windings. This
effectively changed the power supply: from a three-
phase to a single-phase supply. The secondary voltage
dropped from 480 to 415 v across two windings and
increased from 480 to 830 v across the other winding.
- The motor-operated equipment continued to operate
- briefly until the individual breakers were tripped by the
high current in two of the lines. All breakers did not
trip at the same time, which made it more difficult to
diagnose the trouble immediately. The reactor was
scrammed from full power, and the diesel generators

were started, but because the tripped breakers pre-

vented starting equipment from the control room, both
the fuel and coolant systems drained before cooling air
could be restored to the freeze valves. No apparent
cause for the fuse failure was found other than poss:ble
overheatmg from poor electrical contacts

138 011 Systems for Salt Pumps
A. 1. Krakoviak

Although both the coolant and fuel circulating pumps
were off for about two months during this report
period, the oil systems for both pumps were kept in
operation. By the end of the report period, oil had been
circulating continuously in both systems for 27 months.
During this time, 32 samples from the fuel pump oil

20

system and 26 from the coolant pump oil system

showed no significant change in physical or chemical
properties. The collection rate of oil that had leaked
past the shaft seals was normal (between 8 and 16
cc/day) while the pumps were running and zero while

the pumps were not rotating. Inventories show that in

the 24 months through August 1969, unaccounted-for
losses from the fuel pump oil system were 5.4(*4-3)
liters; from the ‘coolant oil system, 5.6(t%5%) liters.
Hydrocarbons at the off-gas sampler indicated approxi-
mately 1 to 2 g of 011 products per day paSsmg that
point. -

At the beginning of power operation in August, a
radiation monitor at the oil reservoir on the fuel pump
oil system indicated radiation from the upper part of
the tank that increased and decreased with the reactor
~power. The gamma spectrometer showed that the

activity was *! Ar, apparently produced by activation of
the blanket gas in the upper part of the pump. Prior to
this time only helium had been used during power
operation, and ‘no gas activation had occurred. Radxa-
txon Ievels did not exceed 2 mr/hr.

T 1.3.9 Radiator and Main Blowers
| M. Richardson

‘The radiator was inspected and found to be in
satisfactory condition at the end of run 18. Several lava
terminal blocks at the heater connections were re-
placed, and 5 ft of the soft gasket seal at the top of the
outlet door was replaced. The lifting mechanism was
lubricated, and the clutch and brakes were adjusted.’

‘The main blower fan hubs and blades were cleaned
and inspected by dye-penetrant methods. No faults
were revealed. The filters and brushes were replaced and
the slip rings cleaned on the blower motors

l 4 REMOTE MAINTENANCE
M. R:chardson

At the start of each shutdown when remote main-
tenance is to be done in the cells, approximately two
days are spent cutting the membrane and removing the
upper blocks. It then takes approximately one day to
set up shielding and remove the lower blocks at each
location where work is to be done. In addition to this, a
good portion of the time spent accomplishing remote
maintenance is in preparation. Some approximate times
spend on various operations are indicated on ‘the
following descriptions of the ]obs done during the
shutdown. -

- Although the ‘in-cell monitors indicated that the
radiation lewels in the cells were several thousand
roentgens per hour and there were beams of more than
100 r/hr above the maintenance shield when holes were
opened for inserting tools, etc., the maximum quarterly
dose received by anyone was 720 millirems to the skin
and 680 millirems to the critical organs. (The ac-
ceptable weekly doses are 600 and 300 millirems
respectively.) .

The removal of the specxmen array from the core was
delayed for a couple of days due to difficulty with a
heater used to melt the salt from the reactor neck. The
actual removal of the specimens and delivery to the hot
cell took less than 8 hr. Some particulate activity was
dispersed during removal of one of the tools, and,
although this did not appreciably delay the shutdown,
several days (over 100 man-hours) were spent cleaning
the high bay around the reactor cell. Installation of the
new specimen array assembly and chécking that the
flanges were leak-tight took approximately 12 hr.

The radiation level from the control rod drives after
they were removed from the cell was low enough (<600

21

mr/hr) to allow working directly on them without

shielding. One rod was removed remotely and stored in
the reactor cell. It was replaced by a spare rod. A
discussion of the work done on the control rods and
drives is given in Sect. 1.3.3.

During work on -the plugged off-gas line from the
overflow tank, a line from a nitrogen cylinder was
connected to different flanges in the line to locate the
section which was plugged. This took approximately
two days. The plug was found to be in the section
containing an air-operated valve and a hand-operated
valve. An attempt was made to cut this apart in the
reactor. cell so that sections could be conveniently sent
to a hot cell for examination. After about-8 hr it was
decided that this could not be done easily and that the
entire assembly would be shipped to the hot cell. The
radiation from this was S r/hr at 10 ft. Two days were
spent obtaining a large carrier and making preparations.

 

The actual removal and transfer took only a few hours.
The installation of the replacement was complete and
the flanges leak-tight in one day, but due to misalign-
ment, two more days were used getting the air line
connected to the valve operator.

- - A permanent heater was installed in the main off-gas

line near the fuel pump. Although this was a difficult
job, due to interferences, it was completed in less than
two days. This was mainly due to advanced planning
and practice on a mockup. Heating the line and
applying back pressure ‘was successful in removing the
plug that had formed during the preceding run.

A leaky airline disconnect to an operator of one of
the equalizer valves in the drain-tank cell was repaired.
The leak was due to a plastic seal which had deterio-
rated. The actual repairs took less than 2 hr, but there
was about a one-day delay preparing for the job after
finding that the disconnect had been installed backward
during the original installation,

When all maintenance was complete in the reactor
cell, approximately 20 hr was used to weld the
membrane and approximately 16 hr to replace and bolt
down the upper blocks. o

21 lNTRODUCTION
B E. Pnnce

Although operation of the MSRE with 235U as the
pnl’lClpal fissile material was terminated in March 1968,
refinements in the analys1s of nuclear -operations data
from this earlier run continue to be of interest. Not
only do we seek to detect and resolve any fortmtous
agreement or dlsagreements between expenmental data
and results calculated from theoretical models, but,
-more important from the standpoint of the present
operation with 233U, the analysis of current data
remains coupled to the 235U run through the residues
of plutonium, uranium, samarium_, and certain other
fission products, and the exposure of the core graphite
produced during the earlier run. During this semiannual
report period we carried out an extensive reexamination
of the basic nuclear data and calculations for the
235U-bearing salt. A number of revisions had been
introduced into the basic library of nuclide cross
sections since the physics analysis for the 235U loading
was first performed, and the current trend is toward the
use of the ENDF/B cross-section library (an evaluated
nuclear data file still in the process of being standard-
ized). Thus we have repeated certain of the neutronics

calculations for the 235U loading using these updated

data and have attempted to assess the consequences of
these revisions on the interpretation of MSRE experi-
ments. The first of the following sections is intended to
provide a precise definition of the calculated cross
sections of interest in the reactor analysis. The remain-
. ing sections describe the results and discuss the conse-
quences of calculations with the newer cross-section
data.

2.2 DEFINITION OF AVERAGE REACTION
CROSS SECTIONS

B. E. Prince

~ For those nuclides which are uniformly distributed in
the fuel salt, the changes which occur in the course of
operation are governed by the following expression for

the reaction rate: | o
RO =N Jy . avf, oE) (. E. 1) P8 dE (1)

where

l{t) total reaction rate for ith nuclide in salt
(events/sec), .

N-(t) number densnty of ith nuclide in salt
-(nuclei per cubic centimeter of salt), -

,(E) = reaction cross sectlon for zth nuchde
(cm?),
d:(r E t) neutron ﬂux at pomt r, energy E and time
t (neutrons cm 2 sec”!),

F(r) = volume fraction of salt at point r,

Vg =all reactor volume experiencing neutron
flux (cm?).

This characteristic of uniform distribution in the salt is
basic to these circulating fuel systems and applies to all
of the important constituent nuclides in the salt. The
possibility of factoring the nuclide concentration from
the volume integration, as shown in Eq. (1), is a direct
consequence of this feature. It allows one to define a
useful microscopic reactor-average cross section which
is influenced by the salt composition only indirectly,
through changes in the neutron energy spectrum. For
our calculations, we have found it convenient to rewrite

Eq.(1) as

chosen just high enough to effectively separate the
slowing-down energy range from the thermalization
range, .. is the average thermal flux to which the salt
is exposed, and ¥, is the total volume of salt in
circulation. [Notice that an equivalent definition could,

if desired, be made on the basis of the total neutron

flux at all energies, ®, simply by replacing E, by
infinity and ®,. by ® in Egs. (3) and (4).]

To apply the preceding definitions to reaction rate
calculations, it is necessary to approximate the exact
neutron spectrum ¢(r, E). In our work with the MSRE,
we have used the GAM-II and THERMOS programs to
produce four broad-energy-group average nuclide cross
sections, where the averaging is with respect to an

-approximate core spectrum calculated by the programs.
We then applied the latter cross sections in four-group

diffusion calculations with the EXTERMINATOR pro-
gram to approximate the variation in the flux spectra in
the peripheral, salt-containing regions of the core (i.e.,
the upper and lower plenums and the radial down-
comer). Approximate expressions corresponding to the
defining equations (3) and (4) can readily be obtained
which describe this procedure. They are:-

broad-group nuclide cross sections are defined by:

the integrals in Eq. (7) are also calculated in terms of

finite sums, using up to 99 energy groups to span the
slowing-down range and 30 groups to span the thermal
range. The cutoff energy, E,, separating these ranges
was chosen to be 0.876 ev for MSRE calculations.

2.3 RESULTS OF REVISED
CROSS-SECTION CALCULATIONS

B. E. Prince

In Table 2.1, we have listed the modified cross
sections obtained in these studies alongside the cor-
responding - values obtained in the earlier calculations.
Both calculations were made for the reactor spectrum
corresponding to the minimum critical uranium loading
(core isothermal at 1200°F, all control rods fully
withdrawn). For reference purposes, several nuclides

. were included in the current studies in addition to those

considered in the earlier work. In each case, these
additional nuclides were not of significance in the 235U
operation and, for the calculations, were assumed to be
present at infinitely dilute concentrations in the salt. In
view of the importance of 23U in determining the
neutronic characteristics of the reactor, three different
sets of cross-section data currently available for these
types of calculations were compared. We found very
little difference in the magnitude of the effective
absorption and fission cross sections calculated with
these data sets. The maximum variation in the average
capture-to-absorption ratio for the sets was about 2%,
with the ratio for the ORNL-evaluated set lying
approximately midway between the current ENDF/B
data and the data set based on ref. 3. However, the
capture-to-absorption ratio for the ORNL set was about
5% smaller than the ratio obtained from the earlier
studies (column 2 of Table 2.1). The ORNL-evaluated
data were chosen as the basis of further calculations.
The other principal changes evidenced in these newer
calculations which are of significance in the interpreta-
tion of MSRE data were in the 232U and 23°Pu cross
sections. The former exerts its influence not only
‘through the neutron poisoning effect on the critical
uranium loading but, more significantly, through the
production of 23?Pu during power operation. Since the

24

regions of the core or the effect of the control rod
thimbles on the thermal flux. Both effects tend to
increase the relative contribution of the epithermal
component of the average neutron flux and influence
most strongly the average cross sections of nuclides
with large resonance capture components (partlcularly
238U 234U and236u') .

In this same connection, the averaged cross sectlons
listed in Table 2.1 should be corrected for changes
caused by increasing the uranium concentration to
reactor operating conditions, and also ‘the insertions of
the control rod to compensate for the excess reactivity.
These changes also increase the average epithermal-to-

. thermal flux ratio in the reactor. In Table 2.2 we have

239Py production rate is very nearly proportional to

the ?32U cross section, this change in nuclear data
alone would increase the 23%Pu by about 5% from the
earlier calculations. (Other modifications besides those
shown in Table 2.1 are also required in the calculation
of the plutonium production, however, as described
later in this section.)

The changes in the 23°Pu fission and absorption cross
sections are in the direction of increasing the reactivity
effect of the 23°Pu and reducing the amount of 24°Pu
present for a given fuel exposure. This change has no
bearing on the interpretation of the critical experiment
at the start of the 235U operation but does enter mto
the analysis of 33U operations.

The average cross sections listed in column 2 of Table
2.1 will be found to differ slightly from those given in
an earlier semiannual report.! The basic cross-section
library was the same in both cases, but the average cross
sections given in this earlier report were appropriate to
a graphite-moderated homogeneous cylinder approxi-
mation of the core; that is, they did not include the
volume averaging over the peripheral salt-containing

2350 GA-5944 (NASA-CR-54263) (Dec. 10, 1964).

indicated the relative increases in calculated average
cross sections of the most important nuclides, cor-
responding to the maximum 22U concentration and
rod poisoning experienced in the 23U run. This
occurred at the end of the zero-power experiments and
before the fuel was drained, when the 233U concentra-
tion had been increased by nearly 10% and the
regulating rod was near full insertion. Although further
uranium additions were made during the *35U run, at
no time during operations were these conditions ex-
ceeded. In accordance with the discussion given above,
the maximum changes in Table 2.2 are seen to be
associated with those nuclides W1th strong resonance
capture components.

During the actual course of reactor operation, the
uranium concentration and the rod insertion varied in
accordance with the fuel burnup and additions and with
the various reactivity changes in the core. For the
purposes of calculating the reaction rates, however, the

.corresponding changes in the average cross sections can

be closely approximated by linearly interpolating the
results given in Table 2.2 on the basis of the 235U
concentration.

2.4 EFFECTS ON OTHER MSRE NEUTRONIC
CHARACTERISTICS

B. E. Prince

Integral neutronic characteristics which are directly
affected by the changes in nuclear data are the
calculated critical 235U loading, the depletion coef-
ficients for the various uranium isotopes, and the rate
of production of plutonium. The calculations summa-
rized in the preceding section also have current applica-
tion in interpreting the measurement of the capture-to-
absorption ratio for 233U (see Sect. 6.3.1). In the case
of the calculations for the critical experiment, we found
that the net change in multiplication factor introduced
by the new cross-section data was —0.0053. This is
equivalent to an increase of approximately 2% in the
calculated critical concentration of 235U. While this
modifies somewhat the apparent very close agreement
between calculated and observed critical loading ob-
tained in the earlier analysis,® the agreement remains
good by most standards for these types of calculations.
By use of perturbation theory computations, the net
change in the multiplication factor was decomposed
into component effects. The revisions in the 22U and
238U data corresponded to changes of +0.00141 and
—0.00520, respectively, in multiplication. The re-
mainder of ~0.0015 corresponded to slight increases in
parasitic absorption in lithium, fluorine, and zirconium.

The revised values of the burnup coefficients for the
uranium isotopes are listed in Table 2.3, along with the
values reported earlier. The principal change is in the
238y depletion rate, which introduces an overall
increase of 4.8% in the net rate of depletion of the
uranium inventory in circulation.

assumed that any additions to the 233U inventory are
made at the beginning of the operating interval. These
equations, which represent the solutions of the differ-
ential equations describing the isotopic changes in
power operation, are approximate in the sense that the
reactor-average reaction cross sections have been as-
sumed invariant during the operation. As discussed in
the preceding section, the actual variations in these

 
 

 

 

cross sections are quite small. In particular, for the
variation in uranium inventory during the 2**U opera-
tion, very close approximations are obtained by use of
constant average -cross sections corresponding to the
mean 235U inventory during the entire operating
period.

Equations (1), (2), and (3) were applied to the
calculation of plutonium inventories in the 23*U run.
The average cross sections were interpolated from the
values given in Tables 2.1 and 2.2 to correspond to &
mean circulating inventory of 69 kg of 235U. The
resulting mass ‘inventory of 22®Pu and the 24°Py/
239 Py mass ratio are shown in Fig. 2.1 as a function of
‘the time-integrated fission energy. As a result of the
change in the 23®U nuclear data, the total inventory of
plutonium is increased relative to the plutonium pro-
duction reported earlier (ref. 1). It is interesting to
note, however, that the 24°Pu/23%Pu ratio depends

primarily on the 23°Pu cross-section data and is

independent of the 238U cross section for the fuel
exposures considered. By Taylor series expansions of
the exponential terms in Egs. (1) and (2), one finds:

3.1 FREEZE-FLANGE THERMAL-CYCLE TEST
F.E.Lynch

The freeze-flange thermal-cycle test was continued
through cycle 400 before being shut down for another
inspection and minor repairs. A complete dye-penetrant
inspection of the inner face and bore flanges was
previously made at the end of cycles 103 (ref. 1), 268
(ref. 2), and 321 (ref. 3). Visual inspection of the flange

312 Inspection of the Flanges

The flanges were disassembled for inspection after
cycle 400, and the oval ring gasket with stainless steel
insert screen was removed for inspection. The average
outer diameter of the frozen salt cake on the screen

“insert was 10 in., approximately the same diameter as

exterior during and at the end of each cycle revealed no

thermal fatigue cracks. Downtime due to operational
problems was insignificant compared with earlier

periods. These problems and the ﬂange mspectxon '

results are reported below.

3,'1.1 Facility'Operation Problems

The accumulated downtime during this operation
period (cycles 322400) was due to burned-out test
section heaters and a building power failure. However,
there were several minor operation problems, such as
instrument trouble and plugged vent lines, that were
repaired during or at the end of the oscillation time.

A burned-out test section heater on the pipe adjacent

all previous inspections except for cycle 103, which was
11", in. Higher flange operation temperatures during
that cycle series would account for the difference.

. A complete inspection of the bore and faces of the

freeze flange was made with a fluorescent dye pene-

trant.* No evidence of thermal fatigue cracking was
visible either on the flange face or in the bore of the
female flange. Also, the face and neck of the male
flange were free of cracks or porosity indications. The
fluorescent dye penetrant did indicate a change in the
crack pattern which was previously observed? in the
bore of the male flange. Figure 3.1 shows a new dashed
cracklike pattern, the original pattern, and a porosity

“band indication extending clockwise around the bore

- from the upper bore thermocouple. The dashed crack-

to the female flange resulted in approximately all the

downtime. One cycle was obtained without this heater
bank by increasing the other heaters within the box to
their upper limit. Since the higher amperage settings
would shorten the life of the remaining heaters,
operation of the loop was stopped to replace the heater.
Another cycle was not completed due to a building

- power failure which occurred during the oscillation

period. The power was off 35 min, so the loop cooled
down too much to continue oscﬂlati_on of the salt.

used.

flange. '

The freeze flange was reassembled after inspection
and the thermalcycle test continued. A total of 452
thermal cycles had been imposed on the freeze flange as
of August 28. Visual inspection of the exterior has
revealed no sign of thermal fatigue cracks. A complete

3.3 MSRE REMOTE GAMMA SPECTROMETER

R. Blumberg  Frank Dyer
A. Houtzeel |

In April and May 1968, after run 16, a series of

measurements of the fission product deposition in

various components in the primary system of the MSRE |

were made using techniques of gamma-ray spectros-
copy.” It was decided to improve the equipment and
techniques, the primary objective being improved accu-
racy of the final results. The revised equipment has
been used at the MSRE since late June, both during the
reactor shutdown and the start of operation in run 19.

The improvements to the equipment that were sought
were the following:

1. the ability to position and to mdve the detector with

respect to a given remote target with accuracy,

. improved detector and analyzer capablhtles (better
resolution of a spectrum),

. improved data handling,

source strength,

. the ability to examine reactor components durmg
-and 1mmed1ately after power operatlon

. the ability to use the colllmator in a wide range of

~reactor components are highly collimated, first by the
~ 1-in. hole in the collimator body and then by the long,
- narrow hole in the collimator insert before entering the

detector. A laser is positioned above the hole in an-
adjustable mount so that its beam can be directed down
through the hole along the same path as, but in the
opposite direction to, a gamma ray coming from the
component. This serves as visible evidence of the source
location and as a reproducible method of positioning
the detector. There are three interchangeable collimator
inserts with hole diameters of %4, %, and % ¢4 in., so

‘that the radiation level at the detector can be varied by

as much as a factor of 9 as desired. The inserts have
index pins for reproducible positioning. The insert and
the laser mount are bolted together to assure alignment
when being used. The collimator body provides both
shielding and support for the other items. It is mounted
on a thrust bearing with three adjustable jackscrews for
leveling. A pair of level gages are mounted on top of the
collimator body so that the gages indicate that the axis
of the collimator (thus the path of a gamma ray) is
vertical.

The detector, a 31-cm® Ge(Li) crystal in a right-angle
Dewar, is mounted so that it may be moved horizon-
tally into and out of the gamma-ray beam by means of

a feed screw. Its output is fed to a 4096-channel

analyzer which has several data reduction features. For
recording the spectra either a magnetic tape unit or a
typewriter can be used. =

For measurements taken during a shutdown, the
portable maintenance shield is used to support and
move the spectrometer over the chosen component. We
also have four holes which have been drilled through
the concrete shield blocks over the off-gas line (line
522), the primary heat exchanger, the drain tank, and
the sample bomb in the off-gas sample installation in
the vent house for use when the reactor shielding is in

_place. The containment membrane between the blocks

remains intact as before. These holes extend the. scope
of the program in that we can take measurements of
fission products while the reactor is at power and
immediately after. This will provide information on.
isotopes with the shorter half-lives. These holes also give

us the ablhty to take measurements mdependent of the
portable maintenance shield.

When using the maintenance shield to scan a large
area of a component, several methods of assigning a
location to a spectrum are used. With the laser shining
through the hole, one can look through the lead glass

windows into the cell and see where the laser beam
strikes the component. This can be recorded on a
sketch or a plan-view drawing. The position of the
collimator body can also be related in x-y coordinates
to the stationary frame of this maintenance shield. Both
of these are used to locate and move the spectrometer.
 

However, a more exact location is obtained by taking
readings from two transits set up in the high bay, We
use a FOCAL program to compute plan-view coordi-
nates from the angles which are recorded at the time
the spectrum is taken. The overall location system
works well and does not delay the data-taking process.

The final item worth noting is a computer code
developed by the Mathematics Division by which the
spectra, recorded on magnetic tape, can be listed in the
form of computer printout and plotted and certain
calculations can be performed. These steps would be
time consuming and expensive if done any way other
than by computer. '

3.3.2 Test Program

To achieve the best results from the remote gamma
spectrometer, a test program was initiated that had
three basic areas. The status and progress of each of
these areas is discussed below. The testing began as soon
as pieces of the overall system were delivered. Since it
was not completed before the shutdown period began,
the test program will be resumed when the necessary
equipment and areas become available.

Mechanical Features. — It was necessary first to
assemble, inspect, and operate all the mechanical
components of the system. Although there were some

small defects that required rework, there was nothing

serious. Much work was done with the location system,
that is, the method by which we know the exact
location of the source of the gamma rays entering the
detector. While taking data with the ¥, 6-in.-diam insert,
an alignment discrepancy of 1 in. was detected. (The
highest count rate occurred 1 in. away from where we
thought it should.) This was attributed to the fact that

the laser beam had a considerably smaller diameter than

the insert. We have corrected this condition by visually
inspecting the laser beam to assure that it passes
through the center of the hole at both ends of the
insert. :

33

- In addition there were a number of malfunctions of
various components of the system which delayed the
test program, such as the tape drive, a broken switch on
the control panel, and an assortment of shorts. How-
ever, this type of trouble appears to have been
eliminated. :

. Calibration. — In order to calculate the quantltles of
fission products deposited, it is first necessary to
evaluate the counting efficiency of the spectrometer.
This is done by measuring a known source with the
system set up in geometry similar to what it would be
when measuring the desired sources, which in our case

. are the reactor components‘. In the test program a

Properties of the Detector and Electromcs - The _

detector and the electronics of the system were tested
with various radioactive sources. The overall system

- resolution was found to be 1.9 kev, which compares
with 6 kev for the detector used previously. The

performance stability of the analyzer was improved by
placing it in an air-conditioned room. Some instabilities
were found which appear to be influenced by count
rate, voltage, and frequency. We will investigate these
and also the effect of changing the position of the
detector with respect to the collimator hole.

25-curie source of !'®™Ag in the shape of a heat
exchanger tube was moved to different positions in a
mockup of the heat exchanger. The source and mockup
were in the remote maintenance practice cell and the
counting equipment in the adjoining hot equipment
storage cell, positioned at a carefully located hole in the
wall between the two. The portable maintenance shield
was used to manipulate the source. Ninety-four spectra
were taken through the ¥ ¢-in. collimator. Because the
tape recorder was inoperative, all the output was taken
on typed listings; due to time and the amount of hand
calculation involved, we have not yet reduced the
results.

By choosing a tubular source for these measurements,
we obtain a calibration which should be applicable to
the situation in the heat exchanger but not quite so
applicable to other geometries. As a consequence of
measuring the source at various positions in the

‘mockup, we will also obtain an empirical value for the

effect of attenuation in the heat exchanger. The
calibration for the Y- and the Y%-in. collimator
remains to be done.

3.4 NOBLEMETAL MIGRATION IN THE MSRE
|  R.J.Ked

In connection with the development of off-gas sys-
tems for molten-salt breeder reactors, a model based on

‘conventional mass transfer concepts was developed in-

an attempt to describe quantitatively the migration of
noble metals in the MSRE. The assumption was made
that noble-metal atoms are present in the fuel salt as
single unstable atoms (in a reduced state chemically)

- looking for a surface to settle on. It was assumed that
- they deposit with equal affinity on all exposed Hastel-

loy N and graphite surfaces (sticking fraction = 1.0) and
that the parameter that controls the rate of migration

 
 

 

 

to these surfaces is the mass transfer coefficient. This
quantity can be readily estimated from standard heat
transfer correlations and the use of heat-mass transfer
analogies. In computing the mass transfer coefficient, it
was assumed that the diffusion coefficient of noble
metals in salt is 1.3 X 10~% cm?/sec. The model also
takes into account noble-metal migration to circulating
bubbles and to the off-gas system via the spray ring.
The basic equation is simply a rate balance on the fuel
salt which treats the fuel loop as a well-stirred pot:

ac . o
V —— = generation rate from fission + generation
from precursor

— decay rate — migration rate to graphite
surfaces

— mxgrat:on rate to Hastelloy N surfaces 7

~ migration rate to bubbles — migration rate to
pump bowl via spray ring,

where a typical migration term is:
migration rate to graphite surfaces = hAC

and where

C = noble-metal concentration .in salt (atomslvolume
of salt),

t = time (hr),
V = volume of salt in fuel loop (fta)
- h = mass transfer coefficient (ft/hr),
A = graphite surface area (ft?).

Note that this equation is for the unsteady-state case
and can be carried through the power history of the
reactor. That is, the final concentration at the end of a
period at one power level is the initial condition for
operation at another power level. Once the noble-metal
congentration in fuel salt (C) is solved for, we can
compute the migration rate to the various reactor
surfaces (e.g., the heat exchanger) and ultimately the
total amount of each noble metal on these surfaces at
any time. -

The amounts of certain noble metals s’uckmg to the
tubes and shell of the primary heat exchanger were
measured by gamma-ray spectroscopy at the end of run
14 (last run with 235U). Measured and computed values
are compared in Table 3.1. The agreement seems to be
quite good, especially with .the amounts computed
assuming no circulating bubbles.

A large amount of data is available on the deposition
of noble metals on Hastelloy N and graphite from the
core samples. Unfortunately the fluid.dynamic condi-
tions are not sufficiently well known to compute a mass
transfer coefficient. The measured amounts are some-
what less than expected but not enough to be inconsist-
ent with the model.

Another test of the model is. to compare the
calculated - and measured amounts of noble metals
“dissolved” in fuel salt. For this comparison, only data
from freeze valve samples are used, since it is known
that ladle samples are contaminated by noble metals in
the gas phase at the pump bowl during the sampling
procedure. The calculated concentration is for the case
of no circulating bubbles. With bubbles, the calculated
concentrations would be less. Results are shown in
Table 3.2 for run 14 (last 235U run) and runs 17 and
18 (333U). Some freeze valve samples are not included
in this table because they are known.(or suspected) to
be in error and not representative of the fuel salt for
some reason. Freeze valve samples taken when the
reactor power was reduced to zero also are not included
because it is a characteristic of the model that the
calculated concentration will approach zero in a short
period of time.

Niobium-95 c¢an either be reduced or ox:dxzed
depending on the chemical state of the fuel. It is
included here only to illustrate the range of the ratio
that can be expected. For the other noble metals, the
measured concentration is 20 to 35 times the calculated
concentration (about 140 for *°%Ru). This can be
explained in several ways. First, we might speculate that
the noble-metal atoms are present as particles, either
from the coalescence of single atoms to form colloids or
 

possibly from flakes of deposits that have come off the
walls, or both. There is a good deal of evidence that
noble-metal particles of some kind do exist in the fuel
salt. Second, it may be that the sticking fraction is less

35

than unity, Third, there is the possibility that the freeze
valve samples are still being contaminated in some way.
In the past a good deal of trouble was had with this
problem.

4.1 DEVELOPMENT OF REACTOR
DIAGNOSIS USING NOISE ANALYSIS!

R.C.Kryter - D.N.Fry
J.C. Robinson?

The major objective of this continuing program

during the report period was to demonstrate the
applicability of neutron.and pressure noise analysis for
continuous monitoring of the amount of cover gas
entrained in the circulating fuel salt. To meet this

- objective, previous work was extended (1) to confirm
tentative conclusions that the neutron noise is propor-
tional to the void fraction, (2) to verify the theoretical

model used to infer absolute void fraction from noise

measurements, and (3) to better understand the sources -

of the fuel pump pressure fluctuations that cause a
major portion of the neutron noise through their effect
on any compressible gas volume in the core.

In regard to the first of these studies, it had been
shown previously that there exists strong coupling
between the observed neutron noise and naturally
occurring pressure fluctuations having frequencies in
the vicinity of 1 Hz. This led us to postulate that the
absolute helium void fraction in the fuel could be
measured by cross correlating the neutron and pressure
signals to obtain a neutron-to-pressure gain factor,
which could then be related to void fraction through a
mathematical model of the system neutronics and
hydraulics. However, further studies revealed that this

“method, though correct in principle, does not yield the

correct void fraction for the MSRE. This failure is
thought to be due to the location of the presently
installed primary system pressure transducers, which are
positioned on gas lines too far from the reactor core to
sense the true pressure fluctuations which produce

versity of Tennessee, Knoxville.

neutron fluctuations. This finding underscores the

- necessity of having high-quality, properly located

sensors in future MSR’s.
To verify the model ‘used to infer void fraction,

" experiments were conducted in which a train of small

sawtooth-shaped pressure perturbations was introduced
into the primary system. This was done under condi-

- tions where the void fraction (~0.6%) was independ-

ently measured by reactivity balance and pump-bowl
level techniques so that it would be possible to
determine which of two sets of mathematical boundary
conditions at the pump-loop connection® gave the best
agreement. (The installed pressure sensor was adequate
for these tests because of the larger signal-to-noise ratio
provided by the imposed periodic pressure perturba-
tions.) The test results indicated the superiority of one
of the sets of boundary conditions and the correctness
of the model.

In the third of the cited investigations, we attempted
to uncover the primary sources of naturally occurring
pressure noise by observing the response of the pressure
noise- to (@) changes in bubbler line and other helium
supply flow rates, (b) switching off the fuel circulating
pump, and (c) variations in system conditions observed
over a period of about two months. Pressure noise
signals were obtained from five available sensors located
on the helium supply lines leading to the salt pump
bowl or to the overflow tank. None of the helium
supply flow rate changes (including disabling the
automatic pressure regulator) resulted in a significant
alteration of the pressure noise in the frequency region
for which strong neutron coupling had been demon-
strated. When the fuel off-gas line was severely re-
stricted near the pump bowl so that the off-gas was
forced to bubble through the salt in the overflow tank,
switching off the fuel pump effected a pressure noise
reduction by a factor of 3 to 5. This result indicated

Fraction in the MSRE Using Small Induced Pressure Perturba-
tions, ORNL-TM-2318 (February 1969).
 

“m

that at least when the main off-gas line is plugged,
operation of the fuel pump is not the only source of
pressure noise. A set of data taken at 320 kw with the
fuel pump stopped and the salt circulating by natural
convection showed that the remaining pressure noise
was nearly as strongly coupled to the neutron noise in
the vicinity of 1 Hz as before. This implied the
existence of some compressible volume in the core at
the time of the experiment. In observations of the third
category, a greater degree of success was attained when
it was noted in retrospect that pressure noise in the
frequency region 0.5 to 2 Hz had consistently increased
in magnitude by a factor of ~40 to 100 whenever the
flow path of off-gas from the fuel pump bowl had
become altered due to the development of restrictions.
These results suggested that the pressure noise that
exists when the main off-gas line is plugged is much
greater than usual, but the exact nature of the noise
production mechanism was not revealed. |

The relationships between off-gas line plugging and
pressure noise level and between void fraction and
neutron noise level which were disclosed in the series of
experiments and system modelings described above
were judged to be sufficiently convincing to form the
basis for continuously indicating monitors to be used
routinely by reactor operating personnel. Accordingly,
early in May two analog noise monitors were installed
in the MSRE control room to provide continuous
strip-chart indication of the rms neutron and pressure
noise levels in the frequency range 0.5 to 2 Hz. The
potential usefulness to the reactor operator was demon-
strated when the neutron noise monitor was observed
to respond in the expected manner to changes in the
void fraction produced by fuel pump speed changes and
when the pressure monitor began to show changes
indicative of a restriction in the off-gas system about
one day before a restriction in the overflow tank vent
line became detectable by conventional instrumenta-
tion.

4.2 MSRE OPERATING EXPERIENCE
J. L. Redford

The 15 relays in the rod-scram coincidence matrix

were tested once a day during operation, following the
practice established in 1968 after several failures had
occurred.* There have been no failures since this
practice was begun. : '

Water .leakage into nuclear instruments necessitated
replacement of two chambers. The cause of noise in a
fission chamber turmed out to be a leak in a Tygon
cable sheath, a not unusual occurrence. One of the
compensated. ion chambers, which had been in place
since May 1965, also suffered a water leak. When it was
examined, numerous leaks were found along the seam
weld in the 321 stainless steel bellows sheathing the
cable, and the aluminum can at the outer support ring
was honeycombed by corrosion. (The water in the
instrument shaft contains lithium nitrite buffered with
boric acid for inhibition of corrosion.)

Additional ionization chambers were installed for
monitoring radiation levels around the distillation ex-
periment. At the end of the experiment, all instrumen-
tation and control panels were removed.

One of the transmitters for measuring the coolant
pump bowl level was replaced because of leakage
resistance between the torque motor and ground. The
differential pressure transmitter that measures the
pressure drop across the main charcoal beds suffered a
gross change in range whose cause is as yet unexplained.
Two other transmitters in this location previously
experienced similar changes.

4.3 CONTROL SYSTEM DESIGN
P. G. Herndon

Only a few minor modifications were made to the
instrumentation and controls systems in areas where
operating experience revealed the desirability of im-
proved performance. Seventeen requests for changes in
the reactor system were reviewed. Of these, two
resulted in minor changes in instrumentation and
controls, six required only changes in process switch

‘operating set points, seven did not require changes in
process instruments or controls, and on the remaining

two, design revisions were pending at the end of the
report period. The two design change requests pending
at the end of the previous report period® were canceled.

Improvements in performance are of interest in the
following areas:

Fuel Pump. — To obtain a more accurate measure-
ment of pump speed during the experiments with
reduced fuel salt flow, a digital device that counts the
pulses transmitted by the reluctance-type speed pickup
was added to the system. '

 

SMSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Feb. 28, 1969, ORNL-
4396, p. 33.

 
 

Coolant Salt Flow. — To correct a small error in the
measurement of coolant salt flow, adjustments were
made to the calibration of the indicating system. A
recent calculation (Sect. 1.2.7) shows that 572 in. H,0
rather than 605 in. H,O is the correct value of
differential pressure produced by the venturi element
for a flow rate of 1000 gpm of salt at a temperature of
1100°F. The new value, which also includes a correc-
tion for fluid density based on the latest temperature-

density relationship, represents an increase in indicated
flow of 2.9%. ‘ : '

Sampler-Enricher. — Several of the weld-sealed
solenoid valves used on the sampler-enricher and off-gas
sampler were successfully reconditioned. These valves,
which meet rigid performance and leak specifications,
were purchased from a commercial vendor, and addi-
tional spares are not readily available.

QP—aJ;t/’LL MSBR Design and Development
ﬁ ' ‘

R. B. Briggs

The purpose of the MSBR design and development
activities is to prepare a reference design for a 1000-Mw
(electrical) one-fluid MSBR plant; to design a molten-
salt breeder experiment (MSBE), operation of which
will provide the data and experience necessary to build
large MSBR’s; and to develop the components and
systems for the MSBE. ‘

Work on the reference design for the one-fluid MSBR
was begun in October 1967 and has taken most of the
effort. Prior progress is reported in our semiannual
reports for the periods ending in February and August
1968 and August 1969. The studies have converged on

a design, and some of the more important details have -
been investigated. Much of the design is described in

this report and in previous reports. Writing has begun
on a topical report that will describe the plant and the
results of the studies in considerable detail.

With the general design of the reference MSBR
reasonably well established, we have begun to look at
the MSBE. Calculations indicate that a reactor with a
power level of 100 to 200 Mw (thermal) can satisfy the
requirements that have been proposed to date. A small

effort is being spent on preliminary studies of reactor
designs and on nuclear calculations.

The development program is small, and the experi-
mental work is limited to some of the most important
problems. Work is being done on methods of dispersing
bubbles' of gas in and separating them from circulating
liquids. Preparations continue on experiments to meas-

‘ure the coefficients for transfer of dissolved gas to

bubbles in circulating liquids. These experiments are in
support of the gaseous fission product removal system.

Better values are being obtained for the thermal
conductivities of salts for use in heat transfer calcula-
tions.  Experiments are in progtess to confirm or
improve on the relationships used to calculate heat
transfer coefficients for molten fluoride salts. The
sodium fluoroborate—sodium fluoride eutectic salt has,
because of its low melting point and low cost, been
proposed for use in the intermetallic coolant systems of
large molten-salt reactors. Since this is a new salt to the
MSR program, a forced convection loop is being
operated in engineering tests with the salt.

5.1 GENERAL
E.S.Bettis - Roy C. Robertson

The conceptual design study of a single-fluid
1000-Mw (electrical) MSBR power station is now
essentially complete. Preparation of a comprehensive
report covering the study has begun, with completion

- of the first draft planned for early 1970. The character-

istics of the plant are summarized in Table 5.1.

All aspects of the design of the reactor and turbine
plants were carried to the point where satisfactory and
feasible arrangements could be proposed. The systems,
equipment, and structures were -not optimized, how-
ever, so the .design cannot be represented as having
presented the best solution in all cases.

During the past report period no significant changes
were made in the conceptual design of major equipment
for the plant, such as the reactor, heat exchangers, etc.,

cells, and the associated hot cells provided with

manipulators for disassembly and repair of this equip-

ment. The chemical processing cells for the salts are also
contained within the membrane along with the hot cells
used in conjunction with the treatment plant.

The containment for the fuel salt now consists of the
walls of the circulating system components, the reactor
cell double-walled primary containment structure (with
the space between the walls maintained at a higher
pressure than the reactor cell), and, finally, the sealed

extension of the inner wall of the reactor cell. The

“dome and sealed plugs combine to provide double

containment over the roof plug area.) The primary
function of the dome, however, is during reactor core
maintenance when a portion of the roof plugs are set
aside. For the maintenance operation, the closure lid of
the dome is removed, and a short cylindrical transition

_ piece on the shielded core transport cask is lowered to

reactor plant building described above. A dome has now

been provided over the removable roof plugs of the
reactor cell as shown in Fig. 5.4. This dome is an
extension of the outer wall of the reactor cell. (The

roof plugs are normally sealed and are, in effect, an - -

mate with the flanged opening on the dome. A good
seal between the cask and the cell can thus be made,
although absolute leak-tlghtness is not required because

for the cylindrical layout was the relative ease of
decontamination of a volume having no corners. A
second factor was the straightforward -design of the
hemispherical top to withstand the differential pressure
due to tornado and other disturbances. -

The steel sealing membrane for the reactor building is
covered on the outside with a minimum thickness of 3
ft of concrete over the entire structure. The biological
shielding provided by the concrete permits the weight
of the shielding on the transport cask to be correspond-
ingly reduced. The present requirement is only 2 in. of
steel on the cask to reduce the radiation level on

outsxde contact with the buxldmg to 100 mr/hr.2 The
concrete also provides ample missile protectlon for the
reactor containment system.

- A polar crane is used to service the equipment within
the cylindrical reactor building.- The polar bridge spans
the building and can be rotated to cover essentially all
areas. Two separate cranes are mounted on the bridge,
one of which is a conventional hoist of 150 tons

 

2When a spent reactor cote is raised from the reactor cell, it is
estimated that the radiation level on contact will be about
500,000 r/hr.

capacity. The other is unique in that the 20-ft-diam by
40-ft-high transport cask is an integral part of the crane.
The cask is fixed as to vertical position but can move
laterally from above the reactor cell to positions over
the spent core storage cell and the replacement core
pickup point. New equipment is brought in through an
air lock on the side of the containment vessel. The
hoisting mechanism for lifting the spent reactor core
into the transport cask is located on top of the cask, as
shown in Fig. 5.4. Four individual, but synchronized,
roller chain drives lift the 480,000-1b core assemblies
into the cask. By placing the drive mechanism outside
the cask, with the lifting chains passing through the
seals at the top, the decontamination of the cask after
each use is greatly facilitated.

Excavation for the reactor building will be to the

~ depth required to provide firm bearing support for the

monolithic concrete pad upon which the reactor build-
ing rests. Finished grade level would thus depend upon
the particular site conditions but would preferably be
with about two-thirds of the building showing above
ground. The new arrangement for the reactor plant
made it possible to provide a large waste storage space
at the lowest level to be used for discarded radioactive
equipment and wastes from the plant, including the
graphite taken from the reactor core. The reactor cell is
located directly above the waste storage cell, as shown
in Fig. 5.4. It may also be noted in this elevation view
that the drain tank cell is now an integral part of the
reactor plant building rather than an extension of it.

damage to nuclear plants. A comprehensive analysis of
the design in this respect has not been possible, so to
substantiate our preliminary assessment of the plant
reliability a consultant® was retained to evaluate the
basic- features and to make suggestions for improve-
ments, particularly with regard to equipment and piping
supports. Available funds did not permit a detailed
study, but an overall evaluation was made based on the

51

construct the reactor building, stack, and steam gener-
ator cells on one foundation pad and the turbine

- generator building on -another. In this approach all of

consultant’s judgment and extensive experience in the .

field of seismic engineering.

A summary report from the consultant outlmed the 7_

de51gn criteria used in reactor plants currently under

construction and suggested several areas in whlch the

MSBR design might be improved.

The report stated that current design criteria for
western states near known faults (Diablo Canyon) have
used a maximum horizontal acceleration of 0.25 g for
the operating basis earthquake. Eastern sites typically
use 0.12 g horizontally. The vertical accelerations are

assumed to be about one-half of these values. Values for

the design basis earthquake are usually twice those for
the operating basis earthquake. Most designers have
used the El Centro earthquake data with modifications

- to the acceleratlon spectrum to account for the spemﬁcl

s01l conditions at the site.
“The report pomted out that it is usually not difficult

to design buildings to meet the seismic criteria, because

most structures are inherently rigid and usually coupled
through the foundation to soil that does not amplify
the seismic shaking. The main concern in’ building
design is to obtain a symmetrical layout and a floor
grade without steps in order to avoid the discontinuities
where failures are hkely to occur. The most difficult
design problems are usually associated with the mechan-
ical equipment, because of the amplification of the
seismic accelerations that can occur in the support

structure, vessels and internals, piping, etc. Similar

periods of vibration in the eqmpment can result in
accelerations many times the acceleratlon rece1ved by
the building itself. -

As previously presented! all bulldmgs of the MSBR
plant were located on a common concrete pad Our
reasoning was that this arrangement would' eliminate
breakage of connecting piping between buildings should
there be a fault slippage. This resulted, however, in a

very large pad, and it was not certain what stresses

might develop when seismic loads were applied to the
various structures having different geometnes and
masses. A . suggested improvement in the design was to

 

3H. 1. Sexton, H. J. Sexton and Associates, San Francisco,
Calif.

the piping containing radioactive material is mounted
on one pad where it would be unaffected by fault
slippage. In the very unlikely event of serious displace-
ments between the two pads, damage to the steam
piping would be without risk to the public. These
changes have been made in the MSBR conceptual design

- presented here. The MSBR primary and secondary salt
_circulating loop piping was designed to be sufficiently

flexible to absorb the large thermal expansions due to
the relatively high operating temperatures. This flexi-
bility must be controlled during an- earthquake to
prevent whipping and excessive displacements. Light-
water reactors use spring supports with hydraulic
dashpots on piping and equipment which allow the
relatively slow movements due to thermal expansions
but' damp the rapid shaking encountered in earth-
quakes. Identical equipment is generally not applicable
to the MSBR because of the high ambient temperatures
in the equipment cells. However, we can probably
design satisfactory dashpots using other fluids, such as
molten salts or gases. We are contacting several pipe
support manufacturers to determine if suitable high-
temperature damping equipment is now commercmlly
avallable

5.4, COOLING REQUIREMENTS FOR
WASTE STORAGE PIT

H. A. McLain

The modified MSBR reactor plant layout now pro-
vides a waste pit located directly below the reactor cell
for storage of radioactive spent equipment, graphite,
chemical wastes, etc. The storage capacity is sufficient
for the total accumulation of discarded equipment and
matenal for at least the 30-year plant life. It has been
estlmated that the maximum heat generation in the
waste storage pit at any point during this time would be
less than 600 kw. _

A brief summary of the items contributing to the heat

generation rate in the storage pit is given in Table 5.2.

Many gross assumptions were made in estimating the
values, but they are believed to be conservative. Most of
the heat release is due to material and spent equipment
from the chermcai processing plant, since these items
not only are replaced more frequently but will tend to
have a’greater accumulation of fission products. The
item having the greatest heat release at time of discard
is the discharge from the chemical processing plant
waste tank. This 500-ft> tank would probably require

be stored about 2% years in the processing cell before’

the contents were transferred to the waste storage pit.
At this time the heat generation rate would be about
190 kw. -

The waste storage pit would be mamtamed at slightly

less than atmospheric pressure and at a nominal
temperature of 150°F or less. The inert atmosphere
would prevent a fire hazard, and ordinary concrete
could be used for the cell wall construction because of
the low ambient temperature.* Heat would be removed
from the pit by cooling the cell atmosphere in a water-
cooled finned-tube-type heat exchanger located inside
the storage area. In one heat exchanger design, about
280 gpm of 85°F water would be required to reduce
the outlet nitrogen temperature to about 100°F. In the
unlikely event of rupture of this heat exchanger, it is
estimated that less than 200 gal of water would drain
from the coils before the cooling water valves could
close, assuming a rather pessimistic 10 sec for closure. A
depression in the floor of the storage pit beneath the
heat exchanger would catch and store any such leakage
until it could be removed. Duplicate equipment will be
installed in the cell to provide adequate cooling in event
of failure of one unit.

5.5 PRIMARY SALT DRAIN TANK

E. S. Bettis H. M. Poly
. W.K.Furlong H.L.Watts

Since last described,® we have redesigned the primary
salt drain tank to provide added reliability for the
cooling system, to allow the drain tank to take overflow
from the primary circulating pump bowls, to serve asa
holdup volume for off-gases from the primary system,

and to provide a takeoff and return point for the side

stream of fuel salt undergomg chemical processing.

These multiple functions do not i unpalr operation of the
tank but actually increase its reliability in that, by being
an active part of the pnmary system, any abnormalities
would quickly become evident and could be corrected
before an unscheduled need for the tank arose.

The new conceptual de31gn of the drain tank is shown
in Figs. 5.9 and 5.10. As before, it is about 14 ft in
diameter by 22 ft high and is - fabricated entirely of
Hastelloy N. A double wall provides a %-in.-wide
annular space which is normally filled with flowing salt
from the circulating pump bowl overflow lines. The salt
flow cools the wall and internal shield to prevent
overheating due to absorption of gamma radiation from
the decaying gases and noble-metal fission products
stored in the tank. The maximum steady-state wall

temperature is estimated to be 1261°F, occurring at the

bottom. This method of cooling the wall was chosen
over an external cooling arrangement so that in-service
inspection of the tank would still be feasible. There is
no structural connection between the tank and the
shield; therefore the status of the tank as an ASME
Sect. III class A vessel is not impaired by tlns approach.

The drain tank is cooled by natural circulation of a

‘salt through tubes immersed in the fuel salt. The

coolant salt selected is 7LiF-BeF, (67-33 mole %),

which is essentially the same composition as the fuel

salt. This coolant was chosen over sodium ﬂuoroborate,

The drain tank cooling surface consists of 1500
U-tubes, ¥ in. OD by 0.042 in. wall thickness,
manifolded into 40 separate circuits. Headering for the

individual circuits is done inside the tank, with all welds -

located above the salt level. This results in only 40
concentric pipe penetrations of the tank head. Each
circuit is completely independent and autonomous with
its own piping and heat exchanger for transfer of heat
to the cooling water. The. multiplicity of circuits
provides a much greater degree.of reliability than the
previous design, which contained only two separate
circuits. The total capacity of the cooling system is
about 120% of design load so that, in effect, 7 of the 40
circuits could be inoperative - without having the
capacity fall below the design requirement.

A 5-ft-diam well is provided in the lower head of the
drain tank, as shown in Fig. 5.10, for four jet pumps
which continuously return the overflow salt from the
pump bowls to the primary loops during normal
operation.

5.6 PRIMARY-SALT-DRAIN-TANK OPERATION
AND AFTERHEAT REMOVAL SYSTEM

. W. K. Furlong

" The main function of the primary salt drain tank is
the safe storage of the fuel salt. It will primarily be used
during maintenance operations on the reactor or pri-
mary heat exchangers. The drain tank must meet all the
integrity requirements of the primary system and, in
addition, must contain a reliable cooling system for
removal of afterheat generated by. the fission products
in the salt. Although conditions can be postulated when
it would be desirable to rapidly drain the fuel salt into
the tank, and this indeed renders the reactor subcritical,
quick drainage is not considered to be one of the
emergency shutdown measures for the MSBR. In fact,
for most postulated abnormal conditions it is desirable
that the fuel salt remain in the primary circulating loop.

A schematic flow diagram of the present concept for
the primary drain tank and afterheat removal system is
shown in Fig. 5.11.

Normal operation of the drain tank system can best
be described with the aid of the identifying letters
shown on Fig. 5.11. Gases from the separator mix with
the 150 gpm of overﬂow from the pump bowl in the
tee indicated by 4. The gases flow through a cooled
line, B, to the drain line C, and thence into the top of

the tank. Upon entermg the tank, the gas and salt have

been cooled to 1213°F by a counterflow of cold-leg
salt, D, flowing in an annulus around the overflow line.
This salt also cools the mixing tee and the pump bowl.
The 1213°F salt is then directed through a %-in.
annulus between the drain tank wall and the internal
gamma shield, effectively cooling the wall and the
shield. Four jet pumps, E, located in the bottom of the
drain tank, one in para]lel across each primary salt
pump, return the overﬂow to the hot legs of the
- primary loops.

The cooling system for the drain tank is also shown
schemat:cally in Fig. 5.11. The internal U-tubes are
divided into 40 separate circuits, as previously described
in Sect. 5.5, each containing a salt-to-water heat
- exchanger, I, located in a hot, contained cell in the base
of the natural draft stack, J. Transfer of heat from the
TLiF-BeF, coolant salt to the water is by radiation
from salt tubes to plate coils or tubes in which
low-quality steam is generated. There is thus no direct
contact between the surfaces that would permit water
to enter the drain tank cell via the coolant salt system.
After passing through steam separators, the water vapor
is directed to one of several air-cooled condensers, K, in
the stack, and the condensate is recirculated. The
MSRE drain-tank cooling system, which is based on this
same principle but uses reentrant-type tubes, has
performed satisfactorily. The salt-to-water exchangers
are located about 60 ft above the midplane of the drain
tank to provide the necessary thermal driving head for
natural circulation of the coolant salt. The water-steam
circuit also flows by thermal convection.

Preliminary calculations for the natural-draft stack,
based on performance data for a commercial fin-tube-
type heat exchanger, indicate a stack height of about

400 ft if the water circuits are pressurized to about 100 .
psia. Use of elliptical tubes and an increase in longi-

tudinal pitch would reduce the head loss and possibly
allow the stack height to be reduced to about 300 ft.
No mechanical control of air flow is presently con-
sidered necessary. In the case of very cold ambient air
conditions, however, some means of air preheating may
be required to prevent freezing of water in the
condensers. In any event, our analysis indicates that the
use of the intermediate heat exchangers in conjunction
with the continuous off-gas heat load in the drain tank

will assure molten operatlon of the 7LiF-BeF, coolant
salt. -

As mentioned above, one of the functlons of the
drain tank now is to serve as the holdup volume for
decay of off-gases from the primary system preliminary
to their treatment and disposal in the off-gas system.
The short-lived radioactive gases will decay for approxi-
mately 2.5 hr in the tank, with the U-tube surfaces
acting as sites for noble-metal deposition. The off-gas
passes through charcoal traps and ﬁlters before disposal,
as shown in Fig. 5.1.

- Another new function of the dram tank is to provxde

~ exit and entrance points for the fuel salt flow for the

chemical processing system. The centrifugal pump F, in
conjunction with the jet pump G, is used for trans-
ferring the salt to chemical processing. Also, by thawing
valve H, salt can be transferred to the primary system
by the pumps. This permits a thinner-walled tank than
the gas-pressure transfer system that was previously
proposed.

We are presently developing a code for the transient
analysis of the drain tank and cooling system under
conditions of a rapid salt drain. In this context it should
be noted that a major advantage of using the drain tank
as the off-gas holdup tank is that a heat load is normally
present to keep the natural circulation loops flowing.
This load varied from about 9 Mw soon after startup
(full power) to about 18 Mw with equilibrium noble
metals. With the 18-Mw load, the "LiF-BeF, flow rate
is slightly over half that required for the maximum

emergency load in the drain tank of about 66 Mw.

5.7 GAMMA HEATING IN MSBR
HEAT EXCHANGERS

J. R. Tallackson

The noble-metal fission products which plate out on
metal surfaces in the primary salt circuit are the
principal ‘source of afterheat in empty MSBR heat
exchangers. The problem of afterheat removal will be
most acute if, for any reason, a heat exchanger is
emptied after accumulating equilibrium concentrations
of the noble metals. In this situation, virtually all the
afterheat must be removed by radiative transfer from
tube to tube and from the shells in the exchanger to the

* outer surface of the heat exchanger.

For accurate calculation of afterheat temperatures,

the distribution, in space, of afterheat generation within

the exchanger must be known. From 60 to 80% of the

“total noble-metal afterheat is by gamma emission,’

which is considered to be the principal source of

nonuniform heat distribution; therefore the heat depo--

sition by all the tellurium gammas has been calculated
for five sizes of heat exchangers at times from zero to
three years after draining. Tellurium was chosen since
the energy spectrum of the tellurium gammas appears
to be typical of the noble-metal gammas. These detailed
calculations were made with the assistance of the
Neutron Physics Division using the ANISN program,
which takes into account the energy spectra. Infinite

cylindrical geometry and uniform distribution of fission
product plating (40% of all noble metals) in the tube
annuli of all the heat exchangers were assumed. Figure
5.12 shows the gamma heat generation at shutdown
produced by the tellurium fission products in an empty
563-Mw (thermal) Mark 2 heat exchanger, the largest
size being considered for the MSBR. By referring to
Table 5.6 in ref. 7, these data may be extrapolated to
give the total gamma heating distribution from all the
different noble-metal fission products that deposit in

From these calculations it was concluded that, for
typical MSBR heat exchanger designs,

1. at least 90% of the gamma energy originating in the
tube annulus is deposxted vnthm the heat ex-
changers;

2. reducing the size of the heat exchangers does not
significantly affect this 90% fraction until exchanger
capacity is reduced to the 100-Mw region.

6.1 PHYSICS ANALYSIS OF MSBR

6.1.1 One-Fluid MSBR Reference DeSign:
‘Two-Dimensional Calculation

H.F.Bauman W.R.Cobb

The nuclear data for the one-fluid 1000-Mw
(electrical) MSBR reference design, as reported in the
last MSR Program semiannual report (ORNL-4396),
were obtained from a two-dimensional synthesis calcu-
lation performed by the ROD ‘code.! The synthesis
calculation is obtained by intermeshing two one-
dimensional calculations (the axial and the radial in
cylindrical geometry) and is therefore limited in the
amount of geometric detail that'can be represented
compared with a true two-dimensional calculation. For
this- reason, ROD calculations have been supplemented
by two-dimensional calculations at important stages in
the development of the MSBR designs. :

The current MSBR reference design was recalculated
by the two-dimensional code CITATION,® and the
results are compared with the original ROD calculation
in Table 6.1. The CITATION calculations, like those of
ROD, were performed with nine neutron energy groups,
that is, five slowing-down groups in the range above
1.86 ev and four coupled thermal groups below 1.86 ev.
Considerably .more geometric: detail could be included
in the CITATION calculation, such as the curvature of
the vessel heads and axial reflectors and the structural
details of the salt inlet and outlet regions. However, the
equilibrium concentrations of the nuclides -were taken
duectly from the ROD calculatlon |

The breeding ratios and neutron balances from the
two calculations are in remarkably good agreement. A
slightly higher peak flux and peak power were obtained
from the CITATION calculation; the difference is no
more than would be expected considering the differ-
ence in the method of calculation. We assume that the
peak values obtained from the two-dimensional calcu-
lation CITATION are the more accurate.

" The performance of a single-fluid MSBR is strongly
influenced by the power rating of the plant. Neutron

leakage is an important function of core size in the

one-fluid reactor, and the measures used to control

leakage, mainly the provision of the blanket-like under-

moderated core zone 2, strongly affect the breeding -

gain and the fissile inventory. We therefore studied the
effect of scaling the 1000-Mw (electrical) reference
design to smaller and larger plant sizes.

A series of three cases was run, for power levels of
500, 2000, and 4000 Mw (electrical). The reactors were
scaled from the 1000-Mw (electrical) reference design
by holding constant the ratio of the core 1 volume to
the reactor power. The thicknesses of the regions other
than core zone 1 were held fixed. The salt fraction in
core 1 was allowed to reoptimize, but did not change
significantly. The results are shown as the dashed curves
in Fig. 6.1. The curves for all measures of the
performance increase steeply with plant size in the
region of the reference design and in fact have
appreciable slopes even at the 4000-Mw (electrical)
power level. |

[The conservation coefficient® shown in Fig. 6.1 is
proportional to the quotient of the annual fuel yield
divided by -the specific fuel inventory. Intended as an
approximate index of the cumulative natural uranium
requirement for a growing nuclear power industry, it
assigns a somewhat greater weight to the fuel inventory
than is contained in the annual fuel yield alone.
Computed as the breeding gain times the square of the
specific power, it has the dimensions (thermal
power/fissile inventory)? X G.]

A considerable variation in core life resulted from the
above method of scaling; both the average power
density in the core and the power peaking factor
increased with increase in reactor power. Therefore a
second series of cases was run in which the volume of
core 1 was adjusted to give the same peak power
density in each case. All other parameters were held
fixed. The results are shown as the solid curves in Fig.
6.1. As expected, the core life came out reasonably
constant in this series. The performance curves are
somewhat flatter, but the same strong trend of increase
in performance with increase in reactor power is
evident,

One may conclude from .these- results that the
optimum power density (core life not considered)
increases as the size of 'the reactor is increased. Note

that of the two 500-Mw (electrical) cases, the one with

the lower power density (higher core life) has the best
performance, while above 1000 Mw (electrical) the
cases with the higher power density hawe the better
performance. This suggests that the trend of develop-
ment of one-fluid MSBR’s should be toward larger size
and higher power density.

The effects of changing the power dens1ty of a
single-fluid MSBR are shown in Fig. 6.2. The points
given are from three cases: the reference design (22
w/cm®) and cases with roughly half and double the
power density. These cases were obtained by doubling
and halving the volumes of core zone 1. The thicknesses
of other regions were held fixed, and the core salt
fraction was allowed to reoptimize, although it did not
vary much from 13%. The fissile inventory, core life,
and breeding gain all drop sharply as the power density
is increased. The reactor performance as measured by
the yield and conservation coefficient indicates a broad
optimum at 20 to 30 w/cm?. Note that the reference
design lies at the low-power-density end of the opti-
mum region, to take advantage of the longer core life at
lower power density.

6.1.3 Alternate MSBR Design Studies
H.F.Bauman W.R.Cobb O.L.Smith

The single-fluid MSBR with zoned core, as described
in Chap. 5 of this and the preceding semiannual
progress report, has been adopted as the principal guide
to project development efforts because it seems to us to
combine good development potential with reasonably
good breeding performance. We have recognized, how-
ever, that some sacrifice both in breeding ratio and in
specific power was involved in forgoing the use of a .
fertile-salt blanket, and we have therefore continued to
inquire whether some modifications of the present
reference design might show improved performance and
at the same time seem acceptable from the points of
view of construction, operation, and maintenance.

In this context, we have considered once more the

rather old idea of a single-fluid core (containing both

uranium and thorium), surrounded by a fertile blanket
kept essentially free of fissile material, the two regions
being separated by a barrier which mlght be made, for
example, of Hastelloy N or graphite.

This concept differs from the two-fluid reactor design

- described in ORNL-3996 (ref. 4) and in earlier progress

 

4P R. Kasten, E. S. Bettis, and R. C. Robertson, Des:gn :
Studies of 1000-Mw(e) Molten Salt Breeder Reactors, ORNL-
3996 (August 1966).

reports® mainly in that the separation between fuel and
blanket salts occurs at the core boundary, rather than in
every lattice cell throughout the core, and therefore the
fuel salt must contain thorium as well as fissile uranium.
The fuel salt is essentially that of the reference
single-fluid reactor; the blanket salt may be the same as
in earlier two-fluid MSBR designs (e.g., LiF-BeF,-ThF,

= 71-2-27 mole %), or it might be the same as the fuel

salt except for the absence of the uranium.

Several exploratory calculations were performed to
show the influence of such variables as barrier material,
barrier thickness, average core power density, blanket
composition, and thorium concentration in the fuel
salt.

Some of these calculations were done in a one-
dimensional spherical approximation with the ROD
code, which includes an equilibrium fuelcycle calcu-
lation (and, if desired, automatic optimization of
specified variables). Other calculations were done with
the CITATION neutron-diffusion code in explicit two-
dimensional geometry. Since CITATION does not
include a fuelcycle calculation, fission product and
other nuclide concentrations were taken from the
results of ROD calculations, with minor adjustments of
fissile uranium concentration to achieve criticality. In
other respects the calculations are very similar, making
use of the same neutron group structure, the same cross
sections, and the same diffusion-theory approximations.
As shown in Sect. 6.1.1, they do in fact give very

similar results when applied to the same problem.

Results of the ROD calculations are shown in Table
6.2. Barriers considered in this series were a Y-in.
Hastelloy N layer and a 6-in. graphite layer. Blankets
were considered with 100% salt by volume and with
50% salt—50% graphite. Blanket salt composition was

“varied as indicated in the table (LiF-BeF,-ThF, =
" 71-2-27 mole % or 74-16-10 mole %). Core size and salt
- volume fraction were subject to optimization by ROD,
“while all other variables (except uranium concentration)

were specified. The blanket thickness was chosen large
enough to reduce neutron leakage to a negligible level
and could presumably be reduced somewhat in a
subsequent, more detailed design. The figure of merit
for the optimization is the fuel “conservation coeffi-
cient,” which was discussed at length in the previous

 progress report.?

Results of the CITATION calculatlons are shown in
Table 6.3. In this series the Hastelloy N wall was
assumed to be % in. thick, and, as in the ROD cases,
the blanket thickness was chosen to be effectively

“infinite,” that is, to permit very small neutron leakage.

Comparison of these cases with each other and with
the reference single-fluid reactor suggests a number of
conclusions: (1) The canned-core designs, as expected,
have a significantly smaller inventory of fissile uranium
than the reference MSBR (800—1000 kg vs 1500 kg).
(2) Notwithstanding the presence of a neutron-
absorbing barrier between the core and the blanket,
breeding ratios are significantly higher (1.07—1.08 vs
1.064). (3) Annual fuel yields are therefore better
(5—7%]year vs 3.3%[year), and conservation coeffi-

cients are very much higher (40—60 v 15). (4) If a
Hastelloy N bamer can be made as thin as % in., the
neutron losses are less than the leakage losses in the
reference single-fluid MSBR (0.7% vs 1% of all neutrons
produced), since absence of fissile material in the
blanket leads to a quite different optimum blanket
configuration. (5) ROD case 5 shows that the perform-
ance is little affected if the blanket is made with 50%
graphite rather than all salt. It seems likely that
practical blanket designs will contain considerable

graphite as a construction material. A criticality calcula-

tion for case 5 with no salt in the blanket region gave a
kesr value of 1.008. This indicates that the reactivity of
the reactor would increase if the blanket were drained,
but the increase is not great enough to create a serious

- safety problem. (6) ROD case 6 shows that a reactor in

which barren fuel salt is used as the blanket material
can also have very good performance. In this concept, it

- is assumed that the fuel from the processing plant,

stripped of uranium and fission products, is used to
supply the blanket. This concept has the advantage that
an absolute barrier is not required between the core and
blanket regions, since some small flow of salt (up to the
capacity of the processing plant) could be permitted
from blanket to core. (7) Fast flux levels appear to be

wall and are higher yet for the graphite wall, though the
comparison is somewhat obscured by differences in
geometry used in the ROD and CITATION calculations.
When allowance is made for differences in average
power density, there still appears to be approximately a
factor of 2 difference in the flux above 0.8 Mev for the
two metal wall thicknesses. So far as we now know, we
could not depend upon the Hastelloy N to withstand a
fast-neutron fluence greater than about 1 X 102!
neutrons/cm? (of neutrons with energies greater than
800 kev). Thus replacement of the wall might be
necessary at intervals which are listed in the tables. It
appears, pending confirmation of the assumed allowable
fluences, that the metal wall might require replacement
every 6 to 12 years, whereas a graphite wall would
probably be good for the life of the plant, barring
failure from other causes. '

It remains to be shown that reactor configurations
based on these general conclusions can satisfy other

_ engineering and economic criteria for acceptability. If
~ satisfactory designs can be developed along these lines,

it may be that the canned-core concept will provide an
avenue for further long-term improvement of MSBR
breeding performance.

6.1.4 Gamma and Neutron Heating in MSBR
J.H. Carswell, Jr.  O.L.Smith

Spatial distributions of ggmma and neutron heating in
a 1000-Mw (electrical) single-fluid MSBR were de-
scribed in detail in the previous progress report.® Those
distributions, however, were calculated for an MSBR
design slightly different from the current reference
design. Heat deposition calculations have therefore been
repeated for the reference design, and the results are
shown in Figs. 6.3 through 6.8. The calculations were
performed in the manner described in the previous
report,® that is, essentially with the ANISN transport
code and with allowance for the effect of fuel circula-
tion on gamma-ray source distributions. Results are
shown for a radial traverse in the core midplane, a radial
traverse two-thirds of the distance (132 c¢m) from the
midplane to the top of the core, and an axial traverse
essentially on the reactor center line. The neutron
heating curves include only energy deposition by elastic
neutron scattering events. The gamma ‘heating curves
include energy deposition by prompt fission gammas,
delayed fission product gammas, and gammas resulting
from neutron capture. ‘ ‘

6.1.5 MSBR Dynamics and Control
O. L. Smith

Digital simulator calculations have been initiated to
investigate the sensitivity of MSBR dynamics to fuel
and graphite reactivity coefficients. Emphasis here is
upon relatively severe reactivity insertions which evi-
dently will require prompt control or safety action to
limit temperatures to acceptable levels. The calculations
are based upon a digital computer model which
approximates the current 2250 Mw (thermal) one-fluid
design.

The model represents the core by a typical fuel cell
within which the temperature distribution in the fuel
and graphite is computed in two-dimensional detail,
thereby allowing accurate determination of salt and
graphite feedback reactivities. Also, six-group delayed
neutron precursor distributions are calculated in detail
around the loop to account for delayed neutron losses.
The four heat exchangers are each represented by four
primary salt lumps, four secondary salt lumps, and two
structural lumps. The boiler is represented by a single

lump, and power is removed from the steam side at the
constant rate of 2250 Mw (thermal). The initial fuel
inlet temperature at the bottom of the core is 530°C,
and the primary and secondary salt loop times are each
10 sec. The primary salt spends half its time outside the
core.

In each of the calculations reported here the reactor
was perturbed from steady state by inserting a reac-
tivity step of p = 0.002, which is approximately 1%
‘times the worth of .delayed neutrons in the core. The
inserted reactivity drives the reactor above prompt
critical, as may be seen in the figures.

The first two cases in Fig. 6.9 show the inherent
response of the system without control action of any
kind, for two different sets of assumed reactivity
coefficients. For case 1, the fuel and graphite iso-
thermal coefficients are —2.0 X 1075 8k/k per degree C
and +1.9 X 107% 8k/k per degree C, giving a core
isothermal coefficient of —0.1 X 10~5 8k/k per degree
C. For case 2, the fuel, graphite, and core coefficients
are, respectively, ~4.4 X 1075, +1.9 X 107%,and —2.5
X 1075 8k/k per degree C. Present estimates of the

actual MSBR coefficients are —2.4 X 1075, +19 X
1075, and ~0.5 X 107% 8k/k per degree C for fuel,
graphite, and core. Thus cases 1 and 2 use the present
MSBR graphite coefficient and bracket the present
MSBR fuel and core isothermal coefficients. For sim-
plicity in these initial calculations, the temperature
coefficients were assumed independent of position in
the core. The curves for cases 1 and 2 in Fig. 6.9 show
the input reactivity, the total reactivity, the average
core power density, and the maximum salt (s, ,,) and

graphite (g, ,,) temperatures in the average fuel cell.

The maximum temperatures occur at the center of the
fuel cell at the core outlet. (During the early parts of
the transients there are some internal temperatures a
little higher than the outlet temperatures.) The curves
show that the initial few seconds of a transient (the
power spike portion) are dominated by the prompt

- negative salt coefficient, which turns the power down in

less than a second. But after about 2 sec, the positive
graphite coefficient combines with the salt coefficient,
and then the very small core coefficient dominates the

long-term response, yielding a long “tail” on both the
power and total reactivity and hence producing a long
slow upward drift in temperatures. Ultimately the
power will return to its initial value, since these are
-constant power removal cases, and the temperatures
will level off at somewhat higher values. It is clear that
the larger salt coefficient, and hence larger core
coefficient, of case 2 is an asset both in minimizing the
salt and graphite temperatures and in lengthening the
time during which appropriate control action may
safely be taken. o

 
 

In order to study the response of the reactor system
to the same reactivity perturbation (6p = 0.002) but
with some compensating control-tod action, some
simple control algorithms were incorporated in the
code. It is recognized that the algorithms selected do
not well represent the control system that will be
adopted for an MSBR, but they were chosen for
simplicity, to illustrate the role of external feedback in
the transients being studied and as a step in the further
development of the digital simulation code.

The first feedback algorithm is, in effect, simply a
power coefficient of reactivity, chosen so that the
control rods respond to an error signal of fractional
change in power

P-Py
p 0.001 ——— o =
where P, is the initial steady-state power. The control
rods are constrained further by the requirement that
they move at a fixed velocity such that they insert p =
+0.0005 per second when in motion. Response of the
system with this algorithm is shown in Fig. 6.10. This
case (case 3) is the same as case 1, except for the
external feedback. During the initial part of the

- excursion the control reactivity is rate limited as may

be seen in Fig. 6.10, but after about 1.5 sec the rods
follow the required reactivity. The result of using (P —
Py)/Py as the error signal is to make case 1 behave
essentially like the more tractable case 2 so far as power
level and temperatures are concerned. Clearly, using (P
— Py)/P, as the only error signal is not suitable for
actual control purposes since temperatures must also be
restored to steady-state (or some other desired) levels.

Cases 4 and 5 incorporate an additional error signal
proportional to the fuelsalt mean outlet temperature
from the core. So the total error signal is

where Ty is the steady-state mean outlet temperature; a
= 0.015 for case 4, a = 0.045 for case 5. Again the
control rods are constrained to move at a fixed velocity
such that they insert p = +0.0005 per second when in
motion. The results are plotted in Fig. 6.10. Case 5
shows that in response to a step p =-+0.002, the system
exhibits strongly damped oscillations of power and
temperature with a maximum salt temperature variation
of ~110°C and a maximum. graphite temperature
variation of ~70°C and with temperatures and power

sec.
While the magnitude of salt and graphite temperature

excursions is markedly reduced by use of these simple
feedback algorithms, it should be noted that the initial
rapid power rise still reaches levels several times the
initial power. We would expect that in such a case the
safety system would have to scram the reactor, not
waiting to ascertain that the temperature changes would
be acceptable.

The frequency response of the reactor system, which
is a useful indication of .system stability, may be
obtained by Fourier analysis of the input and output
signals from a transient calculation such as those shown
in Figs. 6.9 and 6.10. This has been done, and the

~ frequency response for cases 1 and 2 is shown in Figs.

6.11 and 6.12. The dashed portions of the magnitude
ratio curves are estlmated extrapolations. The low-
frequency peak in magnitude ratio is determined by the
core (salt plus graphite) isothermal reactivity coeffi-
cient, whereas the high-frequency peak is attributable
to the salt coefficient alone. There is a small bump on

the side of the high-frequency peak associated with the

primary salt circulation rate. The broad maxima in
magnitude ratio of cases 1 and 2 are an indication that

6.2 PHYSICS ANALYSIS OF MSBE
6.2.1 MSBE Design Studies

Addrtronal calculations were performed in the series

reported.” The results of the calculations are sum-
marized in Table 6.4. Since a spherical reactor vessel of
given diameter can be made thinner and cheaper than a
cylindrical vessel of the same diameter, the purpose of
cases 3741 is to investigate the nuclear performance
of reactors enclosed in a nearly spherical vessel rather
than in a cylindrical vessel such as was used in the
"previous 36 cases. The cores in cases 37—41 are right
cylinders; the wvessels are spherical. Radial blanket
thicknesses in Table 6.4 are given at the core midplane;
axial blanket and plena thicknesses are given on the
COre axis.

The previous case 30, with a breedmg ratio of 1.051,
core power fraction of 0.57, and peak damage flux of
5.0 X 10'* neutrons cm™? sec™! at 169 Mw (thermal)
was suggested as one of the most attractive of the
cylindrical vessel cases.

The core of case 37 in Table 6.4 is identical to case

~30. The midplane radial blanket thickness of case 37 is
2 ft, the same as the uniform radial blanket thickness of
case 30. As would be expected the leakage is higher in
case 37, and hence the breeding ratio is lower. Cases 38
and 39 show, however, that by increasing the spherical
blanket midplane thickness to slightly more than 2.5 ft
(a vessel diameter of ~9 ft), the spherical vessel
configuration gives virtually the same nuclear perform-
ance as the cylindrical vessel configuration of case 30.

Although the breeding performance of case 30 and
the equivalent spherical case is high, such reactors have
the disadvantage of a large blanket volume and con-
sequently high fissile salt inventory of ~475 kg of 233U
within the vessel.' Assuming that a breeding ratio as low
as 095 is in fact satisfactory in achieving MSBE
objectives, then case 40 with 275 kg of 233U shows
that by thinning the blanket and slightly reducing core
dimensions the fissile inventory can be markedly

- reduced without sacnﬁcmg other nuclear character-
istics. :

Case 41 is the same as case 40 except for a core salt

fraction of 0.15, which is more nearly that of the
MSBR’s present 0.13 salt fraction.

- For purposes of achieving MSBE ob]ectrves case 41
appears to be the most suitable configuration so far
studied. It has a breeding ratio of 0.96, a core power
fraction of 0.53, a peak damage flux of 5 X 104
neutrons cm ™2 sec™ :at 153 Mw (thermal), and a 233U

- inventory of 258 kg inside the vessel.

~ 6.3.1 235U Capture-to-Absorption Ratio
' in the Fuel of the MSRE

'G.L. Ragan

‘

Additional measurements and a more comprehensive
analysis have improved and extended the preliminary
results reported® six months ago. As explained more
fully in an earlier report,” we measure 7s, the 235U

capture-to-absorption ratio, by comparing the isotopic

composition of two samples of MSRE fuel salt differing
significantly (say, about 1%) in 235U depletion.

Essentially, s is the increase in 23%U concentration
divided by the decrease in 35U concentration. The
precision of the measurements is enhanced by meas-
uring all concentrations relative to that of 22%U, which
suffers only a slight depletion — for which a correction
is applied. These measurements were made by L. A.
Smith and co-workers at the Oak Ridge Gaseous
Diffusion Plant, using a dual-aperture mass spec-
trometer with a UF, electron bombardment source."®

A set of three 50-g samples of circulating fuel salt was
taken early in run 14, and another set near the middle
of the run. A third set scheduled for late in the run had
to be taken, because of sampler trouble, from the fuel
storage tank after the run ended. The measured isotopic

by NASA. The effect of crosssection data source is
significant. For example, the quoted calculated values
differ from earlier (January 1969) values, based on
~ different cross-section sources, by the following factors:
vs, 0.956; 84, 0.962; S¢, 0.988; S5, 1.072. Further
calculations are in progress to determine the effect of
other calculational parameters, for example, the num-
ber of neutron energy groups.

The agreement between experimental and calculated
values for 75 (and for the derived as and 7s) is quite
satisfactory. This agreement inspires confidence in both
the method of measurement and the 235U cross
sections used, although fortuitous cancellation of errors
in both is not ruled out. The agreement for S is less
satisfactory, but since S4 is based on only ten measure-
ments - of R4, both the value -and the estimate of
standard deviation may be questioned. It may be noted
that uncertainty in S, is expected to be the principal
source of uncertainty in the measurement of 73 and
that an error of 10% in S, will give rise to an error of
about 2.5% in ;. Additional measurements of S, are
planned (see Sect. 6.3.3).

6.3.2 333 Capture-to-Absorption Ratio
in the Fuel of the MSRE

G. L. Ragan

The experimental techniques developed and tested
with 235U (Sect. 6.3.1) are now being applied to 233U,

72

As pointed out in an earlier report,” the comparison
of experimental and calculated values will test the
precision of our calculations of n(*33U), a quantity
closely related to the breeding potential of proposed
MSBR systems.

Three sets of fuel samples were taken (m February,
April, and May of 1969) of the circulating fuel of
MSRE during operation with 233U fuel. These samples
are now being fluorinated to remove the uranium from
the salt (as UFg). Subsequently, the isotopic com-
positions of the uranium from different sets will be
compared in the same way as was done with the
samples of 235U fuel.

6.3.3 233U Capture-to-Absorption Ratio in
Encapsulated Samples in the MSRE

G.L.Ragan

The measurements on circulating fuel samples are
being supplemented by measurements on four encapsu-
lated fuel samples. The uranium isotopic compositions
of the two types of encapsulated fuel are chosen so as
to (1) permit measurement of 5S4 and Sg in one type
and (2) favor premse measurement of y(*33U) in the
other.

The four mpsules are contalned in the surveillance
sample array inserted in the MSRE in July 1969, They
wnll be removed late in 1969.

at 20 gpm water flow and about 1 scfh air flow, the
bubbles coalesced to a diameter of about 0.1 in. or
more 12 ft downstream of the generator. When normat
butyl alcohol was added to form a concentration of
about 0.00003 M, there was no coalescence whatsoever,
and the bubbles maintained their initial diameter of
about 0.010 in. What this means to the MSBR is
uncertain, but one can speculate that some of the
fission products, particularly the noble metals, might
act as a surfactant and prevent bubble coalescence.

' 7.2 MOLTEN-SALT STEAM GENERATOR
R. E. Helms

~ Present concepts of a single-fluid molten-salt breeder
reactor (MSBR) use primary salt with a liquidus
temperature of about 930°F and secondary salt with a
liquidus temperature of about 725°F. These salts
transfer the heat produced in the reactor to a steam
generator to produce high-pressure, high-temperature
steam. The salts have good heat transport properties
and low vapor pressure. ‘However, the high melting
point of the primary and secondary salt results in
startup and operating plant procedures different from

those used for fossil or sodium-cooled reactor power

plant designs. A steam-generator development program
is being formulated to develop the technology required

'to produce and successfully operate a molten-salt-

heated steam generator, including materials and fabri-

cation aspects startup and stability consnderatlons ‘and
- supporting research on heat transfer.

The steam-
generator industrial program and the Steam-Generator
Tube Test Stand (STTS),® which have been briefly

 

3Previously called the molten-salt steam gene'rator'test stand.

 
 

 

 

described previously,*+* are the major 'parts of this

program plan. A discussion of these two programs

be used on the MSBE. The vendor participates in the
test programs for both units.
One or more manufacturers will participate in the

program on the basis of competitive proposals. Each

Successful operation of a molten-salt breeder reactor

(MSBR) nuclear power plant requires the development
of economical, reliable components. One of the more
important components is the molten-salt-heated steam
generator. The intent of the steam-generator industrial
program is to obtain nuclear-grade molten-salt steam
-generators for the Molten-Salt Breeder Experiment

(MSBE) " from ' industry and to begin to develop the

additional capability needed to produce steam gener-
ators for future generations of MSBR power plants.
“‘The steam-generator industrial program consists of
four phases that will result in the design, development,
and fabrication of a unit with full-size tubes for testing
in the STTS; an MSBE unit for testing in the Engi-
neering Test Unit (ETU); and the steam generators for
the MSBE. In phase I the industrial contractor will
produce a conceptual design of a steam generator for
use with the ORNL reference design of the 1000-Mw
(electrical) MSBR. The salt flow and salt temperature to
and from the steam generator as a function of load will
be specified by ORNL. The feedwater/steam inlet and
outlet temperatures and pressures will be 700°F at
3800 psi and 1000°F at 3600 psi, respectively, for
full-load operation as specified in the ORNL reference
.design ‘of the MSBR steam cycle. However, the indus-
trial firm may also propose an alternative steam-
generator design. In this case the industrial firm will
‘select the steam cycling (including inlet feedwater
conditions) and outlet steam conditions to the turbine,
but salt flow and salt temperature conditions as a
function of load will remain as specified by ORNL.
Both of these designs will be evaluated by ORNL, one
will be selected, and a conceptual design will bée made
of a prototype for use in the MSBE. Phase II will
comprise the detailed design of the MSBE unit and the
‘detailed design and fabrication of a 3.0-Mw (thermal),
full-size-tube unit that will be tested in the STTS at
ORNL. Phase III will provide for fabrication of the first
complete. MSBE unit for the ETU, while phase IV
results in the fabrication of the unit(s) that will actually

The request for directive, Preliminary Proposal
Number 450, has been deferred pending completion of
the conceptual system design description (CSDD) for
the STTS and availability of funds. Layouts of concepts
for vertical and horizontal steam-generator tube test
units are being made to ensure that the test stand will
accommodate both and to define the requirements of
the test stand for the conceptual system design descrip-

-tions.

7.3 SODIUM FLUOROBORATE CIRCULATING
TEST LOOP

R.B.Gallaher A.N.Smith

Operation of the 800-gpm isothermal loop was
continued through the report period for the investi-
gation of corrosion-product deposition and off-gas
system restrictions. Cumulative circulation time as of
the end of August 1969 was 8200 hr, of which 7200 hr
have been with the clean batch of salt. The loop was
shut down for 18 days in March 1969 for installation of
a hot mist trap, and again for 13 days in May 1969 for
inspection and modifications .of the hot mist trap.
Except for very brief shutdowns, circulation was
continuous for the remainder of the period.

7.3.1 Corrosion-Product Deposition

Studies were continued into the nature and kinetics
of formation of deposits on a cold finger inserted into
the salt in the pump bowl.® Seven tests were run with
the cold finger with conditions as noted in Table 7.1.
All deposits had a bright green color, and the amount
varied from very thin isolated spots to a uniform
Yy2-in.-thick coating over the 2% in.2 of surface.
Chemical analyses were made of the deposits from three
of these tests, and the relative atomic abundances were
calculated with iron considered as unity. An inspection
of the analytical data, which are presented in Table 7.2,

indicates that as the temperature was increased, the 2 17 124 13

quantity of chromium increased relative to the other
constituents. A rough atomic balance can be achieved
by assuming that the deposits consist of a small amount
of NazCrFs mixed with large amounts of NaBF, and
NaF. '

In conjunction with the corrosion product deposition
studies, a plot (Fig. 7.1) was made of the impurities in
all the salt samples taken during circulation of the clean
batch of salt. An examination of these data leads to the
following observations: (#) For a steady-state operation
at 1025°F, the concentration of both iron and chro-
mium is about 500 ppm. Nickel is much lower,
averaging about 20 ppm. The concentration of iron
increased significantly during the period of higher-
temperature operation in August 1968, then decreased
when the temperature was reduced, indicating that
500—550 ppm is the solubility limit for iron at 1025°F.
(b) During the period of steady-state uninterrupted
operation from March 25, 1969, to May 12, 1969, the

average water concentration increased from 400 to

1400 ppm. The total quantity of salt in circulation is
about 0.25 X 10° g, so that an increase of 1000 ppm
would require an addition to the loop of about 250 g of
water. We have found no reasonable mechanism by
which this quantity of water could have been admitted
to the system. For example, the equivalent volume of
atmospheric air at 30,000 ppm water would be 375 ft3,

or about 250 pump bowl volumes; if the moisture
content of the supply helium were 10 ppm, about four
years would be required to introduce 250 g of water.

(c) A rather large spread is noted frequently between
oxygen analyses on duplicate samples; a similar, but not
as pronounced, situation is noted in the case of water
analyses. (d) Draining of the loop on May 12, 1969, was
hindered by a plug which was eventually cleared by
increasing the temperature of the upper portion of the
drain line to above 1000°F. This difficulty may have
been caused by deposition of corrosion products in a

4 38 18 71 1 6

 

relatively cool portion of the drain line. Such a deposit,
if rich in chromium, might serve to explain the decrease
in chromium content of about 120 ppm between March
25 and May 12. The equivalent quantity of Na;CrFe
would be about 115 g, a quantity which might have
been sufficient to restrict the % -in. (iron pipe size) drain
line. Note, however, that a corresponding change was
not noted in the iron content, and an increase in
chromium content was not seen after the subsequent
startup on May 25, when some effect might have been
expected from mixing of the inventory in the drain
tank.

7.3.2 Gas System Studies

We continued to work on methods of coping with
emissions of salt and vapors from the pump bowl so as
'to minimize the possibility of forming restrictions in
the off-gas system.” In March 1969 the test section at
the pump bowl outlet was revised to include a salt mist
trap. Downstream of this unit were placed a porous
metal filter and a 32°F cold trap.

The 'salt mist trap was a 1-in.-ID by 13-in.-long pipe
mounted vertically above the pump so that trapped
liquid would be free to drain back into the pump bowl.
The lower half of the trap was equipped with heaters
and insulation so that the temperature could be

* maintained at any desired point up to about 1300°F.
The Y%-in.-OD tube connecting the trap to the pump
bowl' was also equipped for temperature control and
‘was routinely maintained above the melting point of
the salt. The upper half of the trap was unheated and

‘ unmsulated 50 as to provxde for rapld coolmg of the gas

and any residual salt or vapor. During the test period,
the temperature of the lower part of the trap was
maintained at about 1000°F, and various internal
arrangements were tested for effectiveness in retaining
salt mist. The first arrangement was a baffle array
containing nine plates with %-in. spacing and %-in.
offset holes for gas flow. The second arrangement used
a 2-in.-deep section of wire mesh packed to a density of
about 0.15 g/cc. Third, all hardware was removed,
making the unit a simple settling tank. Of the three
arrangements tested, the first two were effective in
removing about 50% of the estimated input rate of 0.03
g/hr of salt mist. However, the % -in. holes in the baffle
array were too small to permit the trapped salt to drain

back into the pump bowl. Essentxally none of the salt

was removed by the settling tank.

Frozen salt particles that escaped from the mist trap
were carried into a filter. The results of various
weighings and visual inspections indicated that all the
filter elements tested were effective in stopping the
incoming solids. Prelimipary observations indicate that
‘the capacity of the filters is significantly lower during
_periods when the emission rate of the acid vapor is high.

Acid vapors which were emitted from the pump bowl
or which might have formed from wet air contamina-
tion in the test section are believed to have been
_effectlvely removed from the offgas by the 32°F cold
trap. This belief is based on the fact that the down

The results of a series of cold trap weighings indicated
that the rate of emission of acid did not, as had been
predicted, go to zero, but it appeared to level off at
about 1.5 g/week. The possible cause of the continuing
emission was believed to be moisture in the incoming

helium or BF3 or contammatlon with wet air. A cold.

trap test indicated that the BF; was not respons1b1e
and steps were taken to ensure that the H,O content of
the incoming helium was less than 1 ppm. An examina-
tion of subsequent data indicates that the continued
accumulation of acid is due to routine operational and
maintenance activities which result in brief exposures of
the system to the atmosphere. This is shown in Fig. 7.2.

completed after revision to reflect comments by the
pump manufacturers, the USAEC-DRDT, MSBE project
personnel, the Metals and Ceramics Division, the Inspec-

tion Engineering Department, ORNL Reactor Standards
Office, ORNL Quality Assurance Office, and the
UCC-ND Purchasing Division.

A brief specification for the secondary salt pump was
also prepared. It is based on the primary salt pump
specification and lists those changes that are appro-
priate for the secondary salt pump. The material and
the quality assurance requirements are identical to
those for the primary salt pump.

The preparation of a request for proposal package
(RFP) was completed. The technical portion of the
package includes the specifications for the primary and
the secondary salt pumps, the proposed scope of work,
information required in the proposal, and copies of all
the RDT standards referenced in the specifications.

The procurement program as outlined in the RFP
includes three phases: phase I is a conceptual design
study; phase II consists of detail design and production
of a prototype salt pump; phase Il provides for the
construction of the salt pumps required for the ETU
and the MSBE. _

. The principal objectlves in the phase I des1gn concept
study are: (1) to obtain the manufacturer’s best design

- concept for the primary. salt pump, (2) to obtain

assurance that his pump concept can be scaled up
satisfactorily to the flow capacities required by MSBR
salt pumps, (3) to establish mutual understanding of the
salt pump specifications, (4) to establish mutual under-
standmg of the requirements of the quality assurance

- program, (5) to determine the personnel and the

organization that the manufacturer proposes to use to
perform phases Il and Il of the program, (6) to obtain

 
 

 

schedule and cost estimate information for phase II,
and (7) to revise the pump specification to mcorporate
results of the conceptual study.

While the pump specifications require additional
information that will be developed during design.and
analytical studies of the MSBE, we consider -them
sufficiently complete to be used by the pump manu-
facturers to prepare a proposal and to complete the
phase I study.

The RFP package was reviewed and released by

DRDT. It is being transmitted to the following pump
manufacturers selected by the evaluation team: (1)
Bingham Pump Company of Portland, Oregon, (2)
Byron Jackson Pump Company of Los Angeles, Cali-

made utilizing a concentric pipe configuration with the
cooling air flowing in the annulus. The study indicated

fornia, and (3) the Westinghouse Electro Mechanical

Division of Cheswick, Pennsylvania.

7.4.2 MSBE Salt Pump Test Stand

" Programmatic approval was received from the AEC to
proceed with the salt pump test stand (SPTS). The
conceptual system design descnpt;on” was completed
and released for distribution.

. Preliminary design of the stand has been started, and

the concept'® that is being developed is similar to that
described previously. The salt loop and its components
are being designed specifically for the presently en-

visioned MSBE primary salt pump, which requires -

approximately 900 bhp. All the components external to
the salt loop — that is, the cooling air system with its
blowers, ducting, and stack and the electrical supply
system for the pump drive motor — are being designed
to provide capability for testing pumps requiring 1500
bhp.

Layout drawings have been made of the throtthng
valve, heat exchangers, salt loop, and support stand.
The throttling valve, which will be sized to fit an 8-in.
pipe, is based on a 4-in.-pipe-size valve that was
designed at ORNL during the ANP program and
subsequently used for several thousand hours in liquid
metal and molten salt applications. A study of an air
cooling system to remove pump power as heat was

3 psi, and a total air flow of 10,000 ¢fm, two heat -

exchangers each 14 ft long will provide adequate heat
removal for 900 hp at 1000°F salt temperature. Two
centrifugal multistage blowers presently installed in the
EGCR are being considered for circulating the cooling

‘air.

~ The preliminary design is scheduled for completion
by November 1969. After its review by the AEC, we
will initiate immediately the orders for the long-lead-

time items: Ni-Mo-Cr alloy materials and the salt -

pressure measuring devices. We plan to complete the
final design by June 1970.

74.3 ALPHA Pump

The desngn work on the ALPHA pump’! was
completed, and the detail drawings were released for
the fabrication of all components required to provide a
water test pump. The molten-salt or liquid-metal
version of the pump, shown in Fig. 7.3, will operate at
speeds up to 6000 rpm to provide flows to 30 gpm and
heads to 300 ft at temperatures up to 1400°F. These
characteristics will provide a pump for test stand
requirements that fall between those of the LFB and
the DANA pump models.

For the water test the pump tank and auxiliary tank
will be fabricated of Plexiglas to observe the behavior of
the gas-liquid interface, gas entrainment in liquid, and
mist generation and to evaluate the effectiveness of the
means employed for their control. The water test
program will include investigation of: (1) head-flow-
speed characteristics, (2) cavitation characteristics, (3)
effect of axial impeller clearances on pump per-
formance, (4) radial hydraulic thrust on the impeller.
The detail drawings of the high-temperature pump
components will be completed based on the feedback
information obtained in the water test program.

The water test stand is being prepared for the pump.
It consists of piping, two flowmeters installed in
parallel, two throttling valves, a water-to-water heat
exchanger, and necessary mstrumentatlon to determine
pump performance

Corporation. A remote-control programmer borrowed
- from the Air Force was used to operate the cutting and
. welding equipment while the ORNL: programmer was
" being fabricated and tested. Debugging of the new

programmer is still in progress. _
The following operations have been performed with

7 generally satisfactory results by remote maintenance

methods: clamping of the carriage on the pipe, cutting
and beveling with one orbital head, changing heads, and
welding by the tungsten inert gas method. We noted
that nearly perfect pipe joint preparation and alignment

 
 

were required to achieve acceptable root pass welding
without the use of weld inserts. These requirements
were the most difficult to meet with the orbital

80

equipment, and root pass welding gave the most

trouble. Filler passes were made easily and were of good
quality. | :
During the tests, weld defects could often be detected

as they occurred by noting the pips on recorder chart

traces of the welding variables. A Sanborn 150 recorder
was coupled to the programmer to obtain simultaneous
printouts of data from the interrelated weld functions.
Defects in the weld showed up as irregularities in the
charted weld current, travel speed, wire feed rate, arc
voltage, and arc voltage control. The system with the
Sanborn recorder attached is shown in Fig. 7.4.

 

A 7-min color movie was prepared to show the
performance of remote maintenance operations with
the orbital equipment. We also completed a report,
Feasibility Study of Remote Cutting and Welding for
Nuclear Plant Muaintenance, to be issued as ORNL-
T™M-2712.

Simple long-handled sockets and right-angle-drive
tools were used for the remote operations to clamp

‘equipment to the pipe and to adjust the cutter blade or

torch position in horizontal and vertical planes. In
actual remote operations, a hoist would be used to
lower the orbital equipment into position on the pipes
from overhead access locations.

Cutter performance tests included saw tracking and
runout determinations and machining studies on stain-

less steel and Inconel piping. We tested slitting saw
blades of high-speed steel and alloy and single- and

double-bevel cutters of highi-speed steel. We varied the

cutter speed, cutter feed, and carriage travel rate to
determine the combinations for optimum tool per-
formance and surface finish. Dry machining is specified
for nuclear system maintenance because coolants might
contaminate the nuclear system. However, dry
machining requires that the rates of tool travel, cutting
speed, and tool feed be considerably lower than is
standard shop practice. Best tool performance was
obtained with cutter teeth ground to precision specifi-
cations and generously relieved to provide ample

clearance for chip fallout. Table 7.3 shows the number

of inches of cut a blade can be expected to make before
it must be resharpened. The table also shows how deep
the blade would cut in traveling the indicated number
of inches around a 6-in.-diam pipe, taking a 30-mil or a
12-mil cut, as indicated. A short cutter life experienced
in test operations means that blades will have to be
replaced frequently. We plan to test carbide cutter
blades in hopes that they will last longer.

A machining technique has been developed for
remotely preparing J-bevel pipe ends for welding. The
procedure tends to compensate for the variations in
pipe wall thickness which, under the ASME code, can
be as much as 12% %.

1. Make a light cut around the pipe with a thick slitting
saw, and inspect for true tool tracking. Continue
slitting to the predetermined depth which will leave
a land surface for the root weld.

2. On the cutter shaft, mount a hardened steel thrust
washer and a single-angle milling cutter so that the
washer will ride in the slit made by the saw and will
guide the bevel cutter.

3. After makmg the bevel cut, insert a thln shttmg saw '

blade, and cut through the wall.

4, Make a wax impression of the cut joint. Make an
uncontaminated replica of plaster of paris.

5. Machine to a constant land wall thickness at the

. joint by cutting metal from segments of the land
surface where measurements of the replica indicate
it is too thick.

6. Make a second replica of the joint for use in
out-of-cell machining on the stub end of a replace-
ment component to make it fit the pipe mmde the
cell.

7. Use information from the teplica to set programmer
weld current curves so that they will compensate for

Cu
Y

variations in the arc gap caused by out of roundness
or by the machining to give constant land thickness.

TIG welding with the orbital equipment has been
done mostly without weld insert rings, but this method
requires . precise weld - joint machining to obtain
matching pipe inside surfaces and pipe wall thicknesses,
as well as near-perfect alignment of the two joint
members. Failure to meet these requirements results in
root welds that are undercut, that lack full penetration,
or that have too much penetration with a resultant

convex bead inside the pipe. Fill-pass welding is less

difficult, though we noted that the quality of successive
welds depends on prior weld passes. It is quite simple to

- lay good fillers over good root welds, or over good prior

filler welds; however, it is difficult to repair a poor weld

- by welding over it without first machining out the

defect. These observations are based upon test welds on
extra-heavy 6-in.-diam 347 stainless steel pipe prepared
with V- or. J-bevel joints and always fitted up without
joint gap and without weld inserts. Remote work on
nuclear systems cannot use gap joints because of
purging difficulties, or the commercial weld insert rings
without modification.

Because it is time consuming and difficult to do
precision machining by remote control, we plan to
experiment with joints in which one applies weld wire
filler metal to one of the two joint ends prior to placing
the pipe inside the cell. This type of joint preparation
permits plain fusion root pass welding and requires no
other filler wire additions. It should also greatly reduce
the requirements for precision joint matching and
alignment. Several successful root pass welds have
already been performed by a similar method in which
the pipe ends were machined to include an integral flat

. washer on one of the two mating J-joint sections. This

washer permitted the root pass weld to be a single
fusion weld which, in the tests, exhibited excellent bead
shape and full weld penetration.

Satisfactory weld fill passes do not appear to present
great problems. The first two or three fill passes after

. the root weld require special care with heat control to
.properly add filler wire and obtain weld buildup

without melting the root pass sufficiently to cause
dropthrough. These and subsequent passes require only
enough heat input to ensure fusion to the previous pass
and to the joint sidewalls. The control of the arc voltage
on the basis of wire feed rate has been found to
maintain a relatively uniform bead buildup. Pulsing of
the welding current was found to be useful in maintain-
ing a stable weld puddle.

 
 

We were also able to repair some weld defects. Poorly
fused areas, or pinholes in the head, were repaired by
fusion welding without filler wire addition or oscilla-
tion. A procedure was developed to fill local areas
which had to be milled out to remove weld defects. It
consists in placing the carriage about % in. in front of

82

the area to be filled, setting a short arc gap of %, in.,

-and initiating a weld cycle. The automatic arc-voltage-

controlled wire feed will start to add wire as soon as the
arc gap increases upon entering the recessed area. The
wire feeder motor will shut off on the far side of the

.depressed area to permit manual downsloping.

8.1 CONTROL SYSTEM ANALYSIS

W._H. Sides, Jr.  J. L. Anderson
S. 1. Ditto

The results of the simulation of the 1000 Mw
(electrical) MSBR for the investigation of the overall
plant control problems, previously reported,'*? re-
vealed the need for continuing studies to develop a
satisfactory scheme of control. This was expected

. because of the rudimentary nature of the control

schemes tried and the limitations of the analog model.
Work is proceeding on refinement of the model so that

it will better represent the system. In particular the

model of the reactor kinetics and the steam generators
is being expanded with more nodes and provisions for
variable primary salt flow rate. The heat transfer
coefficients, transport lags associated with piping
lengths, and other similar parameters are being cor-
rected and updated according to the latest design
information available from the project. In some cases it
was necessary to recalculate the coefficients to make
them applicable to the multizone models now being
used. The revised model is now ready and is being
patched on the machine. The model provides consid-
erable latitude for trying different control schemes, and
the improvements made in the model should permit its
use over a wider range of power levels. It is expected
that parameter studies will be made to determine the
effect of various reactivity coefficients. ,
The partial-load operating conditions for the plant
have not been well defined, and the results of the
previous transient studies have prompted a more
thorough study of the steady-state part-load plant
conditions. Methods of changing plant load by varying
flow rates, temperatures, etc., are being evaluated to

determine whether the resulting plant temperature and
flow profiles are maintained within design limits under
all part-load conditions. The design limits are maximum
and minimum temperatures and flow rates imposed by
the freezing points of the salts, pump capabilities, etc.
The possible benefits and problems associated with
valving off some of the steam generators in discrete
steps for partial-load operation are being studied.

8.2 DYNAMIC ANALYSIS OF MSBR
STEAM GENERATOR

F.H.Clatk O.W. Burke

The subcontracted work on supercritical steam gener-
ators carried on at the University of Illinois has reached
a reasonable interruption point. As has been indicated
in previous reports, the University of Illinois model has
not been expanded to the full detail contemplated:
notably lacking are parallel channel effects. On the

- other hand, some features not originally contemplated

83

have been factored into the model: in particular, a
simple but explicit representation of the remainder of
the thermal loop is incorporated instead of treating the
unit as an open loop with boundary conditions. The
control scheme is incomplete in that salt temperatures
are not yet held fast and drift away from their
operational levels (but not by a great deal). This is due
to incompleteness rather than inherent deficiency of
the control scheme,

We have in hand a preliminary report on the earlier
part of this work from the University of Illinois and
expect a further report on the work subsequently
performed. In view of the lack of funds to support this
work further on subcontract and in view of the fact
that we shall have an operating hybrid facility within a
few months, it is our intention to translate the steam
generator program to our system in order to be in a
position to expand the detail in the treatment and to
complete the control studies.

 
 

The following are some of the substantive results of
this subcontract:

1. A satisfactory hybrid computing program of a
limited model of the system has been set up.

2. Instabilities observed in the water leg of the system

" on the analog studies, which were thought to be

computational rather than physical in nature, have
been shown to be just that.

84

3. The nonlinearity of the hybrid model has permitted
observation of the system under large changes.

4. A fairly extensive, though still incomplete, control
system has been mapped out and gives good indica-
tion of being satisfactory.
 

9. Heat and Mass Transfer

9.1. HEAT TRANSFER
B. Cox

In previous semiannual reports'*? the experimental
apparatus and procedures for determining the heat

transfer coefficients of molten salts flowing in metal

tubes were described. These reports also discussed the
irregular axial tube temperature - profiles that were
observed with the initial test section; it was speculated
that the irregularities could have been caused by flow
disturbances attributable to a weld penetration at the
point of repair of a hole in the tube wall.

A new test section, identical in geometry with the
original, was installed, and experiments were conducted
with Hitec (KNO3;-NaNQO,-NaNQO;; 4449-7 mole %), a
salt whose heat transfer properties are well known. No
significant irregularities in axial temperature profile
were observed with Hitec beyond a short entrance
region, and the results agreed well with the standard
heat transfer correlations. The salt was removed, and
the system was thoroughly flushed with water and dried
prior to filling with a proposed MSBR ' fuel salt
(LiF-BeF, -ThF4-UF,; 67.5-20-12-0.5 mole %) which
was used in the earlier experiments.? No alterations
were made in the apparatus. Heat transfer coefficients
were determined for 51 runs covering the range of

~ Reynolds moduli 400 to 30,600, Table 9.1 is a summary

of operating conditions and results for experiments
with the fuel salt in the second test section. Figures
9.1-9.3 show typical measured outside tube wall
temperatures and the mean fluid temperatures. A
straight line has been drawn between the measured

- values of mean inlet and mean outlet fluid temperatures

since, assuming uniform heat transfer at the inner tube

~wall and constant physical properties for the salt, the
mean salt temperature varies linearly with tube length.

and Thermbphysical Properties

‘These figures include the laminar, transition, and

turbulent flow ranges: N, = 597, 4277, and 28,104
respectively. While the temperature profile in the
transition region (Fig. 9.2) exhibits an unexplained
peak in wall temperature near the test section inlet
which was also seen in the earlier studies with the
MSBR fuel salt and with Hitec salt, the profile over the
remainder of the tube length is generally regular and
parallel to the liquid temperature profile. This is in
agreement with the results obtained using Hitec, but in
marked contrast with the earlier results obtained with
the MSBR fuel salt, in which no region of regular wall
temperature, parallel to the liquid temperature, was
observed.? No significant irregularities in wall tempera-
ture beyond a very short entrance region are seen in
Fig. 9.3 for turbulent flow, again in marked contrast to
the earlier MSBR fuel salt results.

‘In determining the heat transfer coefficients reported
in Table 9.1 from the temperature data, the limiting,
constant temperature difference, wall to liquid, was
used in the transition and turbulent flow ranges. These

-results are believed to be much more reliable than those

reported earlier, which were based on the variable
temperature difference near the test section outlet.!?
Integrated values of the local heat transfer coefficient
over the entire tube length, coupled with the tube
dxameter-to-length ratio, D/L, were used in developmg
the laminar flow heat transfer correlations.

- In the upper-laminar and lower-transition flow ranges,

1000 < Ng, < 3500, irregular’ temperature profiles
were observed .over most of the length of the test
section, This same effect could be produced up to N,
=5000 at higher wall heat fluxes. Figures 94 and 9.5

~ illustrate the apparent effect of heat flux on entrance

‘region length. At Np, = 3762 and a wall heat flux of

- 2.55 X 10° Btu hr~! ft2 (Fig. 9.4), there is no region

85

of constant heat transfer coefficient, & In contrast,
‘temperature profiles at Npe = 3565 and a lower wall

heat flux of 0.74 X 105 Btu hr! ft-? (Fig. 9.5)
indicate that a significant region of constant A is

‘achieved. Since the fluid being studied has a viscosity
that decreasés with increasing temperature, heat trans-

fer from the tube wall might have a stabilizing effect on

average about 10% below the Colburn relation.

- Figures 9.6—9.9 suggest that the experimental data in
laminar and turbulent flow may be fitted to an
equation of the form:

ordinate = KN, , — m

where K and n are constants having different values for
laminar and turbulent flows and “ordinate” is the
ordinate used in Figs. 9.6—9.9. Least-squares fitting of
the data to the form of Eq. (1) was carried out
assuming the accepted values for the Prandtl modulus
exponent. The fits were tried with and without a
viscosity ratio correction term; it was found that when
this term was included the values for the Reynolds
modulus exponent, n, came closest to the commonly

89

accepted values of approximately % for laminar flow -

and approximately 0.8 for turbulent flow. The resulting
equations fitting the experimental data are:

Nyu = 1-63(NReNprD/L)0'35(#/ﬂs)o'14 N V)]

with an average absolute deviation of 5.7%, for Ng, <

Ny, =0.0217N%; 81v”3(pm )‘“4 v (3)

with an average absolute dev1at10n of 4.9%, for NR e’
12,000.

Because the data in the transmon region dld not
follow the form of Egq. (1), the equation for the

‘expenmental data in. this range of NRe was found by

adjusting the coefficient in the Hausen equation,
resulting in the following relation: .

Ny, =0.089(V3/3 — 125N} 3(u/u)* 1%, . (4)
with an average absolute devnatlon of 4.5%, for 3500 <

convection: Plans are also being studied which involve

. 9.2 THERMOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES
J.W. Cooke

The absolute, variable-gap apparatus which is being
used to measure the thermal conductivity of molten

salts has been described in previous progress reports.! *2
In these reports certain problems relating to the
accuracy of the apparatus were also discussed, and it
was pointed out that the experimental results for the
conductivity of several calibration fluids were higher
than published literature values (~1% higher for
mercury, ~15% for water and Hitec sait). Furthermore,
the thermal resistance of ‘the conductmty cell as a
function of specimen thickness was found to be
nonlinear. A study has been made of these two
problems. L ' -

Three effects were investigated which could, con-
vincingly, cause the experimental results to be high and
the thermal resistance to be nonlinear: natural convec-
tion and thermal radiation of heat through the speci-
men and shunting of heat around the specimen. Both
from a theoretical consideration of the critical Rayleigh
modulus and from the experimental results for a similar
cell obtained by another investigator® we have con-
cluded that natural convection cannot be initiated in
our conductivity cell under normal operating condi-
tions. Furthermore, assuming a temperature level of
800°C and cell surface emissivities of 0.2, thermal
radiation would contribute less than 4% to the heat
transfer across the cell, even for a transparent fluid. The
remaining effect is thus heat shunting.

The apparatus now in use was designed to minimize
the shunting error with fluids having conductivities in
the range 0.05 t0 0.10 w cm™ °C™*. That is, the guard

‘heating was designed to make the amount of heat

shunted around the specimen neghglble for salts having
conductivities in this range. Unfortunately, the con-
ductivities of the salts actually measured (including
those of interest to the MSRE and MSBR) are about an
order of magnitude lower than those for which the
apparatus was designed, and correctlons for the

shunting of heat are required.

As can be seen from Fig. 9.10, the poss1ble heat
transfer paths and modes within the: conductivity cell
are complex, and the temperature distribution along the
cell wall is not known. Thus it was necessary:-to assume
the simplified model shown also in- Fig. 9.10. By
assuming a uniform heat flux and a uniform sink and

‘wall temperature equal to 0°C, an easy solution for the
center line heat flux could be obtained from the

generalized heat conduction equation. The radial heat
transfer - coefficient, U,, could then be decreased to

~ account for the guard heating that was used. -

A plot of the percentage of heat shunted around the
specimen, 1 — F, vs the specimen thickness, AX, for
various specimen conductivities as determined by a

From this plot, for the case with no guard heating, it
can be seen that the amount of heat shunted around the
specimen can approach 100% for large AX and very
small specimen conductivities. Fortunately, in the
actual conductivity measurements, some guard heating
was used, and the specimen thickness was less than 0.1
cm.

The effect of the shunted heat on the conductivity
measurement can be calculated from the reciprocal of

such as that proposed by Kraichnan.'® An alternative is
to resort to classical concepts involving an “eddy
diffusivity” or a “mixing length.” Although mech-
anistically unsatisfactory, these concepts have certainly
led to satisfactory empirical descriptions in many
instances in the past and might prove to be a judicious
path to follow for this case. It is believed, moreover,
that the “eddy viscosity” concept has been con-

siderably advanced by such recent works as that of

Phillips.'® A similar theory is being developed in this

study for the “eddy diffusivity” to relate it to the mean
flow and the concentration gradient. If, in addition, a
theory can be developed to determine the effects of
various interfacial conditions on the “eddy diffusivity,”
then a satisfactory description of the mass transfer

 The chemical research and development efforts de-
scribed below provide extensive support to the Molten-
Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) and to the develop-
ment of advanced molten-salt reactor systems.

A substantial fraction of these efforts is devoted to
investigating the chemistry of the MSRE fuel salt and
offgas streams and the transport, distribution, and
chemistry of fissi i products in these streams. Investi-
gation of the rel; tion of redox potential, density, and
surface tension to gas bubble entrainment in the MSRE
fuel salt and distribution of fission products within the
fuel containment system has continued. Studies of
fission product behavior have been continued with
specimens removed from the MSRE fuel circuit, with
the MSRE offgas sampler-analyzer, with “synthetic”
fuel mixtures, and by investigation of the chemistry of
molybdenum, niobium, and ruthenium in molten fluo-
ride mixtures.

A program for characterizing the physicochemical
properties of the alkali fluoroborates was extended to
develop a broad base of information for evaluation of
fluoroborates as MSBR coolant salts.

Research in solution thermodynamics, electro-
chemistry, spectroscopy, and transport processes in
molten fluorides continues to supply the basic data for
reactor and chemical process design.

A material balance reported p'reviouslyl indicated
that at the beginning of power operations with 233U in

actors continues to emphasize methods which employ
selective reduction and extraction into molten bismuth
containing either lithium or thorium as the reducing
agent. Reductive extraction development efforts were
expanded to include examination of various metal
additives to bismuth and tin for possible process
application. The distributions of cerium between the
reference fuel solvent and pure tin were measured at
various thorium concentrations in the metal phase. A
small pumped loop was operated to investigate the
electrolytic reduction of thorium from a simulated
MSBR fuel solvent into molten lead and its simul-
taneous back extraction into a recovery salt.” Examina-
tion of alternative methods included synthesis of and
tests with sparingly soluble compounds containing the
rare earths which could act as selective ion exchangers
for such fission products.

Analytical chemical development has placed its princi-
pal emphasis on methods for application in semi-
automated controls for molten-salt breeder reactors.
These include electrochemical and spectrophotometric
means for determination of the concentration of U** in
fuels, improved methods for the determination of traces
of bismuth in moltensalt breeder reactor fuels, and
adaptation of small ondine computers to electro-
analytical methods.

assumptions, the most tenuous of which was that the

mass of the carrier salt reserved for a distillation

experiment? was ~113 kg or 1.86 ft*.
“The MSRE was operated at various power levels from
January 26 to June 1, 1969, with a nominal maximum

power output of 80 Mw. The accumulated power

The total weight of *LiF added was 66.28 g (15.8 g of
61i). Prior to ®LiF addition the carrier salt was found

by analysis to have an average ”LifZLi concentration of

99.9905 + 0.0015 wt %. The samples recovered after
the addition had a concentration of 99.914 £0.024 wt
%2 which would indicate that the volume of the salt is
3.0 + 0.84 ft>. However, samples of the carrier salt
delivered to the still-pot section of the distillation
apparatus were found to have concentrations of
6Li/ZLi = 1.59 and 2.85 wt %, indicating that the ® LiF
was not dispersed homogeneously in the storage tank
but instead had dissolved preferentially in the salt

- fraction delivered to the still pot. Homogeneous dis-

fuel salt (based on the previous material balance')

should be given by the lower concentration line in Fig.
10.1. Samples of fuel salt were removed from the
MSRE pump bowl and analyzed regularly by coulo-
metric methods which had been applied previously and
which are ‘checked against standards on a routine basis.
Their precision and accuracy is regarded to be ~+0.5%.
The results of these analyses, shown as the data points

- in Fig. 10.1, are, on the average, greater than the

nominal values by 0.008 wt %, ~1% of the nominal
value, and indicate (disregarding precision limits for
purposes of this calculation) that the net weight of the
carrier salt during this period was 4639 kg rather than
4708 kg, or that an additional mass of 69.0 kg (1.13
£t) -of salt, that is, a total of 2.99 ft® of the original
carrier salt, was not returned to the reactor to consti-

“tute the 233U fuel charge. In an attempt to support the

conclusion that some 3.0 ft* of carrier salt was left in
the fuel storage tank, an isotopic dilution experiment
was performed in April 1969, in which two samples of
6 1iF were added to this tank. Retrieval of samples from
the tank using a windlass and 10-g sample ladles was
subsequently successful in: removing small amounts of

salt (which incidentally were found to be encrusted

persal would have resulted in a higher average ®Li
concentration in the sample recovered from the fuel
storage tank, and a lesser volume of salt would have
been computed from the results of the isotopic dilution
analysis experiment. Thus, although its lower limit
cannot be deduced unequivocally from the isotopic
data, the volume of salt retained in the storage tank
cannot have been as high as 3.84 ft3.

The efforts to obtain samples from the storage tank
provide additional information that allows a separate
estimate of the salt volume. Sometimes small quantities
of salt were obtained, sometimes none. If this is
interpreted to mean that the salt level was at the point
in the dished head directly below the samples, the pool
contained 3.0 £t of salt. Assuming that the storage
tank contained 3.0 ft> of salt rather than 1.13 ft* used

‘before, we correct the earlier result 4708 — 182.6 (3.0

ft3) kg + 1130 (1.13 ft®) kg and conclude that the
drain tank contained 4638 kg of carrier salt at the
beginning of 233U power operations. Thus the net
weight of the fuel charge at the beginning of 233U
power operations was 4638 kg + 38.3 kg = 4676 kg, and
the uranium concentration was 0.819 wt %. Assuming
fission rates for 233U =4.11X 1072 g/Mwhrand ?35U=
9.76 X 107 g/Mwhr and the capture rate in 2%%U =
2.9 X 107 g/Mwhr, 805 g of uranium should have
been consumed during runs 17 and 18. At termination
of run 18 the concentration of uranium in the fuel
circuit should then have been 0.800 wt %, and including
the heels in the drain tanks its average concentration in
the fuel should have been 0.802 wt %. As noted in Fig.

the MSRE fuel salt on termination of run 18 should
therefore have been 7LiF- Ber-ZrF4-UF4
(64.52-30.18-5.16-0.137 mole %).

The fuel drain-flush-fill cycle has appeared previously

to result in the transfer of approximately 18 kg of fuel
salt to the flush salt and subsequent dilution of the fuel
salt by ~16 kg of flush salt. Corresponding effects
might then be expected to cause the MSRE fuel salt in
circulation at the beginning of run 19 to be "LiF-BeF,; -
ZrF4-UF, (64.49-30.23-5.14-0.137 mole %).’
. Operation of the MSRE at a maximum power level of
8.0 Mw should have resulted in changes in the isotopic
composition as described in Table 10.1. The few
analytical data which are currently available (see Table
10.1) suggest that 22U has been consumed at a slightly
faster rate than anticipated for 8.0-Mw operation.

1102 A MATERIAL BALANCE FOR PLUTONIUM
IN THE MSRE FUEL SALT
" R. E'.'T Thoma

Current plans for resumption of operations with the
MSRE include consideration of plutonium as a constit-
uent of the fuel. During the final period of operation

with 23%:233 fuyel, a sufficient amount of plutonium
was generated for its detection in salt samples to be
tractable by standard analytical methods. Until con-
sideration was given to the possibility that additional
plutonium would be added to the fuel in extended
operation with the MSRE, the precision of plutonium
analyses was not regarded to be of significant conse-
quence. Now, however, it is advantageous to appraise
the quality of previous analytical data in order that
future operatlons of the reactor can. be evaluated
satisfactorily.

Approximately 600 g of plutoruum was generated
in the MSRE fuel as it was operated with 235U fuel by
neutron absorptions -in 232U, enough to afford a
comparison of the analytical data with anticipated
values. The results of that comparison, reported here,
are expressed as a material balance for plutonium. They
show that the analytical chemical methods which were
previously satisfactory for determination of the con-
centration of plutonium in the fuel salt are of question-
able utility for use with the present 233U fuel charge
and that isotopic dilution methods, using mass spectro-
metric analyses, appear to offer the most satisfactory
means. of analysis. They indicate, in addition, that at
the maximum concentrations in which plutonium has
 

 

 

 

occurred in the MSRE fuel salt, it has existed as a stable
chemical entity and, by inference, that Pu, O, is not
precipitated in the presence of low concentratlons (50
to 60 ppm) of oxide ion.

The net production rates for plutonium generated in
the 235238 fyel salt have been estimated® to be

where

G* = mass of k in circulation (g) (k = 238, 239, 240
refers to 238U, 23%Py, and 2 °Pu respectively),

T = time-integrated power (Mwhr).

At termination of the 235U experiment, 589 g of
plutonium should have been generated in the fuel salt
with the reactor operating at a maximum power of 8.0
Mw. For a fuel charge of 4900 kg, this corresponds to
120 ppm. The average concentration of plutonium in
the fuel salt as determined from the results of analyses
of 18 fuel salt samples obtained during the latter period
of power operations with 235238 U fyel was 118 ppm.
The analytical data do not show a significant trend and
are probably not sufficiently precise to use as a basis to
infer that a real difference exists between calculated
and analytical values. On completion of these power
operations uranium was removed from the fuel salt by
fluorination.’ It was anticipated that the plutonium
would remain in the carrier salt. Five samples of the
carrier salt were removed from the fuel drain after
fluorination and found to have an average concentra-
tion of 120 ppm of plutonium, representing a total of
562 g, as compared with an expected value of 125 ppm;
that is, 27 g of plutonium is not accounted for by the
results of these analyses.

The concentration of plutonium in a salt specimen is
calculated from the relation:

Conc. Pu (ppm) = dpm/g X 3.97 X 1078+ (338N
X 1.470+23°N X 5.402X 1072 +290N X 2.00X 1072

+241NX 410X 107 + 242N X 3.5X 107%),

where N is the atom fraction of plutonium as the
isotope designated. -

The concentration of plutonium in each of the lO—g
samples of fuel salt taken since the beginning of 23*U
operations was determined using conversion factors
which assumed -that the plutonium in the MSRE
consisted entirely of 23?Pu and 24°Pu. The average
concentration of plutonium after full loading of the
reactor was achieved was found to be 147 ppm. This

“value indicates the presence of a total of 689 g of
plutonium; thus the enriching salt might then have been
expected to contain 100 g of plutonium. In an attempt
to substantiate this conclusion, a sample of the
TLiF-233UF, enriching salt was obtained from a
section of transfer line at the TURF and submitted for
chemical and mass spectrometric analysis. The salt
residue which was contained in the line was considered
to be typical of that delivered for use in the MSRE. The
results of mass spectrometric analysis showed that this
salt contained plutonium, 1.64 wt % of which was
238Pu. Revised conversion factors were therefore re-
‘quired for calculation of the total plutonium concen-
tration of the TURF salt and 233U fuel salt because of
the high specific activity, 6.46 X 10° dis sec™? g™
for 2®Pu. The plutonium concentration of the TURF
salt appears now to be 249 ppm using the revised factor
and corresponds to the addition of 16.37 g of plu-
tonium along with the "LiF-233UF, eutectic. Current
estimates of the nominal concentration of plutonium
are now based on the assumption that this amount of
plutonium was added to the fuel salt and therefore that
the MSRE contained ~605 g of plutonium at - the
beginning of 233U power operations.

A plutonium inventory of the MSRE fuel has been
computed, both before and after loading with 233U
fuel, based on Prince’s estimates of the production and
fission rates for plutonium and on the assumption that

16.4 g of plutonium was contained in the enriching salt.
A comparison of the calculated values and analytical
results is given in Tables 10.2 and 10.3 and in Fig. 10.2.

103 SOME FACTORS IN GAS BEHAVIOR
IN THE MSRE FUEL SYSTEM

J. H. Shaffer

‘ .Béginning early in the operation of the MSRE on
233y, the amount of gas entrained in the pump and

circulating fuel was much higher than that experienced

during operation with the original 225U fuel mixture.®

This condition has been related to a rather dramatic

effect detected upon insertion of beryllium or zir-
conium metal into the fuel mixture at the pump bowl
and has resulted in much lower apparent densities of

the ‘salt in the pump bowl, in increased salt overflow

rates, and in minor instabilities of reactor performance.
Ensuing investigations have related the apparent density

gradient in the salt and the appearance of voids in the -

circulating fuel to the speed of the fuel pump.” These
results imply that gas entrainment by the salt jets (used

for xenon stripping in the pump bowl) varies with the |

speed of the fuel pump and is sufficient, at higher pump
speeds, to induce gas entrainment at the pump suction.
However, a better description of void formation charac-
teristics in the fuel circuit and of their anomalous
relation to the introduction of beryllium or zirconium
into the pump bowl salt reservoir is needed. A
reasonable explanation of these remaining problems can
be derived from gas solubility behavior.

The MSRE fuel system design provides a free salt
surface in the pump bowl which is swept at a nominal
rate with an inert gas, helium or argon. Also, a side
stream from the pump discharge is returned to the
pump bowl as a salt jet spray. Although this salt spray
functions as a stripper for removing gaseous fission

products from the reactor fuel mixture, it should also

be an excellent saturator for dissolving the helium or
argon cover gas into the salt.

According to gas solubility behavior as deﬁned by
"Henry’s law, the fuel mixture during normal reactor
operation should contain dissolved helium at a concen-
.tration corresponding to its saturation limit at the
pressure of the pump bowl. Since this is the low-
pressure point in the circuit, there should be neither a
net gain or loss of dissolved helium in the system nor
the formation of voids at any location in the fuel

As inferred from earlier mvestlgatlons excessive
quantities of gas may be introduced into the MSRE fuel
system by entrainment at the pump suction. Entrain-
ment rates which would lead to significant effects on
reactor performance can be quite low, well within
pump design specifications® and below limits of de-
tection in the MSRE:® Considering an isothermal fuel
temperature of 650°C and estimated system pressures,
the maximum concentrations of helium that could be
dissolved in each fuel region are shown in Table 10.4
according to solubility estimates by G. M. Watson.'®
The release of all gas from the fuel at these dilute

7

concentrations would be equivalent to a void fraction

of 0.9 vol % in the fuel system. Relatively small fuel
temperature changes in the MSRE will alter gas solu-
bility but should not have a pronounced effect on the
system.

If the appearance of voids in the fuel system is

. considered as gas in excess of its solubility, then void

fractions in the fuel loop can be related to gas

~entrainment at the pump suction. These effects are

shown in Fig. 10.3 for the introduction of helium in

_excess of its solubility at the pump suction and at

steady state. Thus a gas bubble entrainment rate of
about 0.6 vol % at the pump suction could be tolerated
without the appearance of voids in the fuel system.
Entrainment rates in excess of about 0.85 vol % would
produce voids in the reactor core.

Since gas addition and depletion from the MSRE fuel
system occurs in the pump bowl, the rates at which gas

One may now realize that the formation of voids in .

the MSRE fuel system can be attributed to small, and
otherwise innocuous, changes in operational behavwr of
the pump bowl. The formation of voids at lower pump
speeds (lower gas entrainment rates) during the use of
argon as the pump bowl cover gas can now be

rationalized on the basis of its lower solubility in the |

salt. The dramatic effects observed at the reactor upon
introduction of beryllium or zirconium can also be
assigned to changes in the solubility of gas via changes
in the surface tension of the salt.!! The magnitude of
these changes according to estimates, again by G. M.

SURFACE TENSION OF SALT (dynes/cm)

actual surface tension of the MSRE fuel salt now or at
any period during its history is unknown, the contri-
bution of this parameter can only be deduced from
considerations of the reactor performance record. How-
evet, any change in the surface tension of the salt can
be reflected through gas solubility behavior to the
increase or decrease in the void fraction of the fuel.
‘Although gas solubility behavior can be employed to
explain operational irregularities in the MSRE, further
experimentation may be required to verify these con-
clusions and to better evaluate its effect on MSRE and
MSER operation. The relative rates at which the inert
gases' dissolve in molten salts would have a direct
bearing on this argument. Since surface tensions are
estimated to only +30 to —10% accuracy, additional
measurements would be required to improve these

- values and to determine ranges over which salt surface
tensions can realistically be varied. Although noble-gas
- solubilities  in ‘several fluoride mixtures have been

measured,! 2+!?" estimated values for the MSRE and
MSBR fluoride mixtures are known only to within a
factor of 10. Accordingly, more direct measurements as
functions of salt surface tensions may be desired.

11. 1 EXAMINATION OF THE FOURTH SET
OF SURVEILLANCE SPECIMENS
FROM THE MSRE

F. F. Blankenship  E. L. Compere 8. S. Kirslis -
A fourth set of graphite and Hastelloy ‘N surveillance

samples was removed from the MSRE core after the

June 1, 1969, shutdown. The set was received at the

hot cell for disassembly on June 6, and sampling ‘was

~completed by June 16.

11.1.1 Examination of Graphite
In all there were 11 pieces of graphite for chemical

-examination. Three pieces of ordinary CGB graphlte,

designated NL-7, X-10, and ML-3, were exposed. for
76,000 Mwhr (2.6 years at témperature) at the top,
middle, and bottom of the core respectively. Similarly,
M-1, X-23, and N-l were ordinary CGB graphite
exposed for 20,000 Mwhr (0.8 year) at the top, middle,
and bottom of the core respectively. A third stringer
was also exposed for 20,000 Mwhr (0.8 year), which
was the duration of operation with 223U, From this
stringer came V-47, an impregnated CGB, from the top
of the core; P-129, an ordinary CGB from near the top
of the core; K-3, a piece of impregnated Poco graphite
from near the middle of the core; YY-22, ordmary CGB
with one surface polished, from the middle of the core;
then V43, nnpregnated CGB, from the bottom of the
core. The.76,000-Mwhr exposure corresponded to a
thermal fluence (E < 0.876 ev).of 1.5 X 10!
neutronslcm and a fast fluence (E > 50 kev) of 1.1 X
10?!; the 20,000-Mwhr exposure gave thermal and fast
ﬂuences of 5.1 X 10%° and 2.8 X 10%° neutrons/cm
respectlvely

An important dlfference between this set of samples
and earlier ones is that no 'flush salt was used after the
reactor fuel was drained. Visually, however, the pieces

. drained quite well. When examined under the binocular

microscope at 30X power, salt was found mainly at the
joints between two pieces of graphite.

104

Except for pieces that were chipped while removing
pins on disassembly, the graphite bars were weighed. No
attempt was made to clean the bars before weighing,
since this could have removed fission products from the
surface. The weight gains ranged from 5 to 20 mg,
corresponding to 0.001 to 0.006 wt %. This was mostly
from salt on the surface and did not represent an
appreciable penetratlon .

Visually, the graphite appeared unaltered by the
exposure. Films that were visible under unusual lighting
during dismantling of the sample assembly “were not
visible under the binocular microscope, although several
lighting arrangements were tried. Lengths were meas-
ured, and in several cases the graphite had apparently
grown. This is extremely unhkely, and we beheve the
measurements are spurious.

11.1.2 Radiochemical Analyses of the Graphite

Results were obtained on 21 faces of graphite (11
pieces). Material from a single 50-mil-deep cut on V47
was lost. Profiles of fission product penetration to a
depth of 50 mils were obtained for eight faces by
milling successive samples of the following thickness:
%,%,1,2,3,5,8, 10, 10, 10 mils. Total depositions
per square centimeter were obtained on the other 11
faces by means of single 50-mil-deep cuts.

‘Radiochemical analyses were requested for %7Sr,
90gr, °1Y, 95Zr, ¥5Nb, *°Mo, '%3Ru, 1°¢Ru, ! 1! Ag,
IZSSb’ 129Te’ 132Te’ 13“1,‘ 144Ce’ l4QBa’ IS,GCS, and
137Cs. Results were available at the end of the
reporting period only for the short-lived isotopes that
had to be caught early. These were Mo, '32Te,
111 A0 and '3'I, and because of their short half-lives
the amounts of these isotopes present pertain only to
the recent history of the reactor (see Table 11.1).

In terms of .deposition per square centimeter, the
amount of **Mo was about 0.09 times the amount
calculated to be present per gram of salt if it escaped
from the fuel only by decay. This calculated amount
will be referred to as the inventory per gram of fuel salt.

'The amount of *?Mo deposited was lower by a factor

of 3 or 4 than found on the last previous surveillance

samples.! Why this should be is not known. -
For '®2Te the amount per square centimeter was
about 20% less than that previously found and corre-

sponded to about 0.12 times the inventory per gram of
salt. The '3%Te in the six faces that received a long -

exposure averaged over twice the average for 14 faces
that had short exposure. This may have been a

coincidence; it has not occurred prewously and is

difficult to explain.

With respect to propensity to deposnt on graphite,.

111 Ag is in a class with *SNb and thus differs from
%Mo or !32Te. This is borne out by the fact that the

111 Ag deposited per square centimeter is 133% of the

inventory per gram of salt.
This time more than twice as much 31 was found in
the graphite as previously. This probably reflects the

fact that flush salt was not used and should be expected

for all the salt-seeking fission product ions. Preliminary
results, however, indicated that this prediction did not
hold. Instead, for example, the *5Zr, !37Cs, and ***Ce
were present on metal to the same extent as when flush
salt was used.

Typical profiles for 99Mo 132, “’Ag and 131

are shown in Fig. 11.1. As usual, the curves looked as
though they could be resolved into two processes: a

slow high-capacity diffusion process that accountsfor =

the steep part of the curve, and a faster low-capacity
process that accounts for the tail. The tails are believed
to be real because they have been substantiated by
grinding samples from the inside out to the surface.?

Control samples were lower by ‘a factor of 1000 or

more than the samples from-the MSRE specimens.
There was no significant difference with respect to
polished or unpolished surfaces, impregnated or un-
impregnated CGB, or impregnated Poco, and with the
possible exception of !32Te, as noted above, there was

no significant difference with exposure time. The

sta'gionary liquid layer at the interface between flowing
fuel and graphite appeared to be rate controlling.

nation in a random fashion which gave occasional high
values that distorted the deposition pattern. Generally,
these high numbers were not for the surface samples
and were also encountered among the control samples
which had not been exposed to either salt or irradi-

- ation. Fortunately, the amount- of uranium in the

graphite remained negligibly small even when the high

numbers were used. In the worst case, a piece of
- unimpregnated CGB that was exposed only during the
233y operation contained 3.17 ugfcm? on one surface

and 3.26 pg/cm? on another. This is slightly over twice

as high as ever previously encountered and about four

times higher than the average previously encountered.

- This may have been 2 result of cracks in the sample.

However, a higher amount of uranium on the graphite
might be expected, because flush salt was not used.

There was a distressing lack of correlation between
the exposure time and the amount of uranium found,
This may have arisen from the fact that progressively
poorer graphite, as far as cracks were concerned, was
available for later insertions.

All of the samples were analyzed for uranium by
delayed neutrons. The uranium was assumed to be
2331 in these cases since this gave the upper limit,
although some 6 of the 21 surfaces examined had been
exposed to both 225U and *33U.
 The potential for determining uranium content by
isotopic analyses of samples spiked with 236U was also
explored. A sample A that had been exposed to 235U
for 56,000 Mwhr and to 233U for 20,000 Mwhr was
compared with a sample B that had been exposed to
only 232U for 20,000 Mwhr. The results are shown in
Table 11.2. By delayed neutron counting 0.82 and 5.93
pg/g was found for the 223U + 235U in samples 4 and
B respectively. In principle isotopic analyses could be
used to determine the ‘“‘geological history” of the
uranium deposition in the graphite and at the same time
to obtain an independent check on the results from
delayed neutron counting. However, because of the
expense ($60 per determination), the scatter, and most
importantly the small amount of uranium found we do
not plan to pursue this “history.”

11.14 Radlochemlcal Analyses of Deposition
~ of Fission Products on Hastelloy N
from the Core of the MSRE

Hastelloy N tubing (% in_.) that had contained a
dosimeter wire was used to provide metal samples from
the surveillance assembly. Seven 3-in. sections of

107

Hastelloy N were taken at equally spaced intervals from
top to bottom of the core. The results of radiochemical
analyses are shown in Table 11.3. The sample sequence
runs from H1 at the bottom to H7 at the top. The
*®Mo found on the metal was 25% less than previously
determined, which is reasonably good agreement.
About 28% more '32Te was found than last time; this

- was again fair agreement. Iodine was another story; the

amount of '?'I found was larger than last time by a
factor of 3.5. This is attributed to the fact that flush
salt was not used. lodine as iodide ion is soluble in flush
salt and would be expected to be lower when flush salt

- is used, and as noted earlier, the iodine on graphite was

also higher this time than before.

In spite of not having used flush salt, the uranium on
the metal was below the limit of detection, which is 19
ug/em?.

In the previously reported material balance® for
fission products in the MSRE, the percentage of
inventory deposited on metal was based on an esti-
mate* of 1.2 X 10° cm? for the area of metal wetted
by the circulating fuel. A more recent estimate®

- indicates the area wetted by fuel is 0.79 X 10° cm?.

Thus previously reported values for percent deposition
on metal should be corrected by the factor 0.79/1.2 or
0.66. The latest values for the distribution of short-lived
fission products in the MSRE are shown in Table 11.4.
These numbers are based on the assumption that the
average value for the samples examined applies to the 2
X 10% cm? of graphite and the 7.9 X 10° cm? of metal
in the reactor.

11.4 THE SURFACE TENSION OF THE MSRE
FUEL AND FLUSH SALTS

S. S. Kirslis

To help explain some puzzling observations of
foaming or high bubble fraction in the fuel melt during
recent MSRE operation, some surface tension measure-
ments on the salt in the MSRE pump bowl were
undertaken. Since changes in bubble fraction were.

- noted most particularly during the periodic reductions

of the fuel salt with metallic beryllium, it was planned
to measure the surface tension before and just after a
reduction treatment. After some laboratory testing of
several simple experimental methods for determining

109

The surface tension tests in the MSRE pump bowl
were carried out using capsules of the types shown in
Fig. 11.2. The graphite cylinder inside each capsule was
drilled longitudinally to provide three '%-in.-diam holes,
three %, ¢-in.-diam holes, and three ', -in.-diam holes.
A slot %, ¢ in. wide admitted molten salt to the bottom
of the capsule and served to indicate roughly the zero
depression salt level. The capsule for a test after
treatment of the fuel with metallic beryllium was
fabricated by welding a cage containing metallic beryl-
lium rods to the bottom of a standard surface-tension
capsule.

A typical procedure was as follows. The assembled
capsule was evacuated overnight at 650°C in a quartz
container to remove water and oxygen from the
graphite cylinder. The degassed capsule was transferred
without exposure to air into the sampler-enricher
cubicle above the MSRE. From there the capsule was
lowered into the pump bowl gas space, allowed to warm
up, then slowly lowered into the fuel salt, allowing the
capsule to fill with salt from the bottom, but leaving a
bubble of gas above the graphite cylinder. The capsule
was then raised above the salt level, causing the salt to
drain out to the level of the bottom of the window. The
salt levels in the drilled holes were allowed to equili-
brate for 30 min. In slow steps, the capsule was raised 2
ft above the pump bowl and the fuel salt allowed to
freeze. The capsule was then rapidly raised up to the
sampling cubicle and shipped to an analytical hot cell.
Here the top of the capsule was cut off with a tubing
cutter just above the top of the graphite cylinder. The
levels of salt in the ten holes were measured using a pair
of F-calipers modified so that the bottom 3 in. of the
depth gauge strip was replaced with a straight piano
wire 0.025 in. in diameter. The measurement of salt
level in a glven hole was usually reproducible to +0.01

- cm.

The procedure was shghtly modified for the capsules

‘with an attached cage of beryllium rods. The capsule

surface tension, the measurement of the capillary

depression of fuel salt in drilled holes in a graphite

cylinder was selected as the most satisfactory method -

for application in the MSRE pump bowl. The measure-
ments of depression were made after the frozen salt had
cooled to room temperature and presumably corre-
sponded to the surface tension of the salt as it began to
crystallize at about 430°C. It was assumed that the
volume changes accompanying freezing and further
cooling would not significantly affect the differences in
salt levels in the holes of different diameters.

was first lowered to a depth calculated to submerge the
beryllium rods but not allow salt to enter the upper
capsule. The capsule was to be lowered further and a
sample of salt admitted to the surface-tension capsule
when salt density or reactivity readings indicated an
increase in foaming. However, in the two runs of this
type to date, there was no change in readings for 2.5 hr.
The capsule was lowered 2 in. further for 2 hr more,
and still there was no change in density or reactivity
readings. To be sure the capsule was submerged, it was

- lowered as far as possible and allowed to remain

submerged for 30 min. The capsule was then drained,
equilibrated, cooled, and withdrawn in the usual way.

_ Fig. 11.3. Surface Tension of MSRE Fuel and Flush Salt.

Six surface-tension tests have been carried outin this  equation

plot of capillary depression vs the reciprocal of the
radius of the drilled hole. It is seen that most of the
data points fall between the calculated lines for surface

or flush salt on clean dry graphlte, as observed in
previous work).

It is believed that the surface tensions of MSRE fuel
salt and flush salt are in actuality about 220 dynes/cm
at 600°C, and even higher at 430°C. The lower values
- obtained in this work are considered to be due to the
uncertainties of the experimental method, in particular
the effect of freezing on the salt levels in the drilled
holes.

The most meaningful result of the present work is the
definite decrease in capillary depression during the
addition of metallic beryllium to the fuel salt. The
lower capillary depression corresponds to a lower
surface tension, which in turn indicates a higher
solubility of helium in the fuel salt. Under these
conditions, the bubble fraction of the fuel at a given gas
entrainment rate would be reduced.®

Some laboratory tests are under way which should
provide a quantitative calibration of the capillary
depression method for measuring surface tension and
should confirm the effect of adding metallic berylhurn
to the molten salt.

11.5 NIOBIUM REDUCTION POTENTIALS
H. W. Kohn

In order to explain the peculiar behavior of niobium
in the reactor,” it was deemed desirable to examine the
solution of niobium metal in molten fluoride mixtures
as a function of oxidation potential. The nickel—nickel
oxide electrode® provided a convenient method of
monitoring oxidation potential. Accordingly, the fol-
lowing experiment was performed:

A niobium rod tagged with ®*Nb was prepared by the
method of Senderoff and Mellors.” The rod was then
immersed in 2 kg of a reduced melt of 2LiF-BeF, + 0.3
mole % UF,, the uranium having been previously

reduced with beryllium metal. The reduction potential
was gradually lowered by additions of NiF, . Changes in
niobium concentration were measured by monitoring
the ®5Nb activity in salt samples which were removed
periodically from the melt. At 882 mv, corresponding
to U**/ZU = 0.09, the U**/ZU was analyzed spectro-
photometrically by J. P. Young and shown to corre-
spond reasonably well to the reduction potential then
being read. When the potential had dropped to 375 mv,
corresponding to a UY/ZU of ~107*, very little (~10
ppm) of the niobium had appeared in the melt. The
melt was then treated with dilute (5.4 meg/liter) HF for
15 min. The voltage dropped to 260 mv, and the

.niobium activity then appeared in the melt. Sweeping

with hydrogen raised the voltage to 556 mv and caused
a gradual decrease of the niobium from 105 to 11 ppm.
Spectrographic analyses of selected samples showed

- poor agreement with the assay by radioactivity.

We attempted to repeat this experiment on salt having
the composition of the MSRE fuel but met with less
success because of erratic behavior of the electrode in
the salt containing ZrF,4, particularly below 400 mv.
Also, the fuel salt contained more oxidizing species
than we had anticipated at the beginning of the
experiment as well as niobium. By adding lithium metal

we gradually raised the reduction potential to 600 mv -

(U**/ZU = 2 X 1073), at which point the niobium
disappeared from the melt. Lowering the reduction
potential with NiF, again failed to make niobium
appear until the melt had been treated with HF. In this
experiment spectrographic analyses checked the radio-
chemical quite well, and a spectrophotometric analysis
when the melt was oxidizing showed .no U?* (<0.1%).

The small amount (~10 ppm) of niobium which
consistently is present in our reduced samples can either
be particulate niobium which passes the filter stick or a

slightly soluble low-valence form of niobium. In view of

the high solubility of Nb* in Flinak,'® we deem this
second possibility less likely than the first. Finally the
apparent “hysteresis’” observed in removing niobium
from solution in going from the oxidized to the reduced
state we attribute to the slowness of coagulation of the
precipitated niobium or a slow rate of formation due to
the great dilution. We find no evidence for stable
soluble low-valence forms of niobium fluoride.

These -data are summarized in Fig. 11.4. The num-
bers next to the data points indicate the order in
which the experiments were done.

11.6 NOBLE-METAL FISSION PRODUCT
CHEMISTRY -

C. F. Weaver

The unpredictable behavior of noble-metal fission
products (Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, and Te) in the MSRE caused
us to initiate studies of their high-temperature chem-
istry some time ago. Our preceding investigations have
been confined to the chemistry of the molybdenum
fluorides, principally because the combination of fission
yield and cross section for the molybdenum isotopes
poses a potential problem in neutron economy and
hence in the breeding efficiency of an MSBR. The
results of these investigations have been described
extensively.! ' ~22 The program of investigation has
necessarily included a variety of efforts, such as
synthesis studies, investigation of the properties of the
several fluorides representative of each stable oxidation
state, their solution behavior, and efforts to identify the
associated species occurring in the gaseous state. The
following subjects were discussed in earlier reports:

2LiF-BeF, 11:14:16:19,21,22 1555 spectrometry of

lithium fluoromolybdates(III),!4:'¢ and absorption
spectroscopy of MoFs,'® MoF;,'%:2° and MoF.2°
The infrared absorption spectrum of MoFs; was in-
vestigated recently and is described below.

As our understanding of fission product transport in
the MSRE has developed, chemical differences among
the noble-metal fission products are seen to be relevant
and to suggest the need for additional kinds of -
information. One example is the recent evidence that
niobjum metal may be oxidized and enter fuel salt
when U*/U* ratios are quite low and might thus
provide a means of monitoring the redox potential of
such a system. In this connection investigation of the
equilibrium Nb + xHF(g) = (x/2)H(g) + NbF, (d) in
molten 2LiF-BeF, was initiated within the last month :

and will be reported in subsequent semiannual reports.
The expenmental approach to this problem was de-
veloped by C. M. Blood?? in his investigation of the
solubility and stability of structural-metal dlﬂuondes in
molten fluoride mixtures.

11.6.1 Synthesis and Stability of Molybdenum
Fluorides

C.F.Weaver H. A. Friedman

Studies of the synthesis and decomposition of the
molybdenum fluorides have been continued, with re-
cent emphasis devoted to MoF,. As with other fluo-
rides of molybdenum, its behavior was very sensitive to
experimental conditions, especially refluxing and over-
pressure. MoF, was evaporated from a Knudsen cell (no
refluxing) and the vapors were analyzed using a TOF
mass spectrometer; this procedure has been reported
previously?? and is discussed below. Evaporation and
disproportionation occurred simultaneously in the
temperature range S00—700°C. At lower temperatures
(265 and 352°C) and under nonrefluxing conditions
evaporation predominated. However, at 350°C with

refluxing conditions and an MoF4 overpressure of a few

millimeters, disproportionation predominated, and the
MoF,; was converted to solid MoF; and a complex
vapor which contained MoF and MoF; . At 250°C and

'MoF;(s) + MoFs 1 without refluxing and 3MoF, -
2MoF; + MoF¢ t with refluxing. The decomposition at
350°C required a copper container, while that at 250°C
was accomplished satisfactorily in quartz.

- The work described above essentially completes our
synthesis ‘studies of the molybdenum fluorides. Our
procedures may now be summarized as follows: Excess
molybdenum hexafluoride is. refluxed over molyb—
denum metal in the temperature range 25 to 75 °C until
the metal is entirely consumed. The result is a yellow
solution of MoF; dissolved in the excess MoF4. The
excess MoFg is pumped off at 75°C reaching pressures
in the low micron range and leaving pure liquid MoFj.

The MoFs (melting point, 67°C) must not be frozen at
this stage because extreme expansion occurs on re-
meltmg and will rupture the container. The temperature
of the system is slowly increased to 200°C while
maintaining pressures in the micron range. The slow
increase in temperature is necessary to maintain the low
pressures and to reflux the evaporating MoF; . During
this step the reaction MoFs - MoF, | + MoFs 1
occurs. The product is pure MoF,, which is a solid at
200°C and is stable for several weeks under these
conditions. The temperature is again slowly increased to
250°C and the pressure maintained in the micron range.
During this step the reaction 3MoF, = 2MoF; + MoF; 1
occurs. These reactions may be carried out in quartz
apparatus provided it is meticulously dried and the

MoFs carefully freed of HF The MoFa isa stable solid
to approximately 400°C, above which it decomposes
forming the metal and higher fluorides. No fluorides of
molybdenum with valence less than 3 have been
produced in these studies or reported in the literature.
The disproportionation reactions are as simple as
written above only if refluxing is maintained with the
removal of the most volatile species, that is, MoFs.
Without refluxing, the vapor phase always contains
MoF¢ and MoF; and frequently MoF, as well. The
synthesis studies will now be directed toward the
fluorides of niobium and, to a lesser extent, those of
ruthenium.

Attempts to dissolve. RuF3 in molten 2L1F Ber
using a copper container resulted in the reaction 2RuF,
+ 3Cu = 3CuF, + 2Ru; the products were identified
using x-ray diffraction. Previously reported experiments
in which RuF; was heated and disproportionated in a
copper container did not result in fluorination of the
copper.2? Apparently in the absence of liquid a
protective layer forms on the copper. Analogous solu-
tions of MoF; in molten 2LiF-BeF, do not react
significantly with copper but. do react with nickel.
These results are summarized in Table 11.5..

flow rate of helium nor hydrogen firing the copper
container strongly affected either the order or the rate
constant. The half-order rate constants, defined as K =
t71(Co /2 — C!/2), associated with a helium flow of 12
liters/hr and with static helium were 8.1 X 1073 and
7.3 X 107 ppm!/2 hr™! respectively. Recently the
effect of the surface area of the copper container was
investigated. By adding copper mesh to the melt, the
surface area was increased from approximately 180 to
1800 cm? per liter of melt. The first addition of MoF;
to this melt resulted in such wide scatter of the data
that neither the order nor the rate constant could be
determined. However, it was observed that the concen-
tration of Mo®* dropped from about 400 ppm to 3 ppm
in 2800 hr, a period only slightly longer than required
in the two cases without the copper mesh described
above. The second addition of MoF; to the same
system produced the much smoother results shown in
Fig. 11.5. The results of these experiments were
subjected to a leastsquares analysis, and the results are

third case results from fewer data pomts since . the
experiment is not complete. The errors hsted in Table
11.6 represent precision within a given experiment. It is
our experience that the agreement from one experiment
to another is far poorer and that the differences
between the constants shown .in Table 11.6 are not
significant. Our present interpretation of these results is
that the Mo®" leaves the 2LiF-BeF, solvent by a
half-order process which is not significantly affected by
the flow rate of helium, the surface area of the copper
container, or the quantity of molybdenum metal
produced by the disproportionation. It was also re-
ported previously?? that the presence of 1—-2 mole %
UF, in the 2LiF-BeF, had no appreciable effect on the
behavior of the Mo®*. These observations lead to the
conclusion that the disproportionation of MoF; in
molten LiF-BeF, or LiF-BeF,-UF, is a homogeneous
event.

11.6.3 Mass Spectrometric Studies
C.F.Weaver J.D.Redman

116

Studies of the vapors associated with the evaporation |

or decomposition of the fluorides of niobium, molyb-
“denum, and ruthenium from ambient to temperatures
slightly in excess of the MSRE fuel have continued.

In previous reports of our mass spectrometric studies,
estimated pressures were given which were reliable to an
order of magnitude. We have recently attempted to
refine the pressure calibration so that equilibrium
constants and the associated thermodynamic values can
be obtained.

Two materials were used as standards. These were
single-crystal "LiF with a purity >99.999% and silver
with a purity of 99.997%. The data were interpreted as
described by R. T. Grimley.25 The vapor pressure
values of M. Eisenstadt?® et al were used for LiF and
those of M. B. Panish®?7 were used for Ag. A single

standard is sufficient in principle, but the use of two
allowed a convenient internal cross check of our
procedure. The agreement between the stadards was
satisfactory. These results have improved the reliability
of our pressure estimates from an order of magnitude to
within a factor of 2. The most severe problem with
respect to further improvement in accuracy is that the
corrosive noble-metal fluorides cause a deterioration in
‘machine sensitivity during an experiment. The use of an
inert gas standard which may be added and monitored
during a fluoride run seems to be the most promising
approach and wﬂl be our next step in calibration
development.

A sample of freshly prepared MoF, was completely
sublimed in a copper Knudsen cell over the temperature
range 225 to 750°C. The composition of the effusing
gas may be seen in Figs. 11.6 and 11.7. In the region
below approximately 220°C the MoF, neither evapo-
rated nor decomposed. The ‘region between 220 and
300 C corresponds to the dlspmportxonatlons

2MoF,(s) > MoF;3(s) + MoFs (g)
and
3MoF4 (s) - 2M0F3(s) + MoF6 (g)

The discontinuity at 300°C in the pressure (Flg 11 6) is
not seen in the composition curves of Fig. 11.7. We
interpret this break to be caused by melting of MoF,,
converting the highsurface-area solid mixture of MoF,
and MoF; to a low-surface-area viscous mixture of
liquid MoF, and solid MoF3. The drop in vapor
pressure as the temperature increases may then be
ascribed to activated®® rather than equilibrium evapo-
ration. Other experimental methods, for example,
direct visual-thermal measurement of melting tempera-
ture and DTA, will be employed subsequently in an

Fig. 11.10. Ionization Efficiency Curves for NbFs Effusing Through a 10-mil Orifice at 70°C.

Our results, subject to refinement with improved
calibration, indicate that the pressure over liquid MoFs
ranges from 1073 to 107! torr, considerably lower than
the equilibrium pressures reported by prewous in-
vestigators?? and lower than observed in our own
spectrophotometric cells. In addition, we find a greater
temperature dependence than indicated by the reported
heat of evaporation.?® These facts indicate activated
rather than equilibrium evaporation. The vapor in the
observed pressure range consists of approximately 80%
monomer (MoFs), 20% dimer (Mo;F,,), and <1%
trimer (Mo3F,s), and the standard enthalpy changes
associated with the re'actions Mo, F; o = 2MoF;s and
Mo; F, s = 3MoF; are 28 and 34 kcal respectlvely

The results of the mass spectrometric studies reported
heré show that all of the molybdenum fluorides except
MoF; are volatile in the range of MSR operating
temperatures both as pure compounds and when

~ dissolved in molten 2LiF-: BeF,. At no time has the
species MoF; been found in the gas phase, although the

volatile . decomposition products of solid MoF; and
MoF; dissolved in molten 2LiF- Ber are detected
routinely and with high sensitivity.

The behavior of NbFs has been descnbed ear]xer
The cracking pattern, appearance potentlals and ioniza-
tion efficiency curves were given for the fragments
assoclated with NbFs and its polymers. This informa-
tion was obtained by eff_usmg NbFs from a Knudsen

A difficulty associated with the above experiment was
the rapid evaporation of the NbFs. An attempt was
made to reduce the evaporation rate by -using a
Knudsen cell with one-half of the previous orifice
diameter, 10 mils in this case. A reduction in effusion
rate was achieved, but the increase in the ratio of
background to molecular beam intensity essentially
destroyed the usefulness of this approach, which for the
present has been abandoned. The ionization efficiency
curves obtained in this experiment may be seen in Fig.

~ 11.10 and the appearance potentials in Table 11.8.

- A second difficulty occurring with both of the above
experiments is that the NbFj is so volatile that samples
are completely evaporated well below the temperature
range of an MSR. To obtain samples of NbF; vapor in

the region ambient to 900°C, fluorine was added to a
Knudsen cell containing metallic niobium. Niobium
pentafluoride was produced, and at least one lower
fluoride, possibly the trifluoride, was present. The
jonization efficiency curves obtained in this experiment
are shown in Fig. 11.11 and the appearance potentials
in Table 11.8. :

Examination of the several ionization efficiency
curves and tables of appearance potentials for both the
molybdenum and niobium fluorides reveals small but
real variations. This is almost certainly caused by
fragments having multiple parents. For example, NbF,"
may be produced from the dissociative ionization of
NbFs, Nb,F; ¢, and Nb;3 F, 5. The relative amounts of
these precursors will of course depend on the tempera-
ture and pressures in a given experiment. The inter-
pretation of such results will be aided considerably by
the calibration efforts mentioned above.

Previously?? the decomposition reaction, ionization

efficiency curves, and appearance potentjals for the

- disproportionation of RuF; in a copper container were
reported. An attempt was made to study the corre-
sponding events in a solution of Ru®* in molten
2LiF-BeF,. As indicated in Sect. 11.4.1, the Ru®" was
reduced producing Cu?*. Consequently the mixture
studied was CuF, in molten 2LiF'BeF, at temperatures
up to 850°C. In addition to fragments typical of
2LiF-BeF,, the ions CuF,*, CuF*, and Cu® were
observed ' with relative abundance of 57, 100, and 33
respectively. The partial pressure of CuF; ranged from

6 X 1073 torr after 3 hr of effusion to 9 X 10~ after
40 hr of effusion. In addition, significant mass transfer
of copper occurred. The reaction 2CuF < CuF, + Cu
provided the likely mechanism which will allow mass
transfer through either a temperature or a pressure
gradient or both. _ N
Recently F. F. Blankenship suggested®® that since the
noble-metal fission products form volatile fluorides, the
possibility existed of removing these elements from the
Hastelloy and graphite surfaces of an MSR with gentle
fluorinating agents. Thermodynamic calculations are of
little use in evaluating potential fluorinating agents
because the reaction products are usually unknown and
because the thermodynamic properties of most of the
known products are unreported. Consequently, a survey
of pertinent reactions was initiated using .a high-
temperature Knudsen effusion cell, a time-of-flight mass
spectrometer, and a gas pressure of approximately 102
torr. Nb® and NbC were exposed to gaseous CF, from
room temperature to 800°C. Volatile reaction products
if present were at pressures below the sensitivity limit
of the mass spectrometer, about 1077 torr. X-ray
diffraction studies of the solid residues indicated that
the starting materials had not changed. Graphite was
exposed to NbFs from room temperature to 100°C.
Again no volatile or solid products were observed.

cation, 1969. e
 

 

 

 

Although the three experiments listed above gave
negative results, it is still possible that higher pressures
and, in the C + NbF; case, higher temperatures may
cause reactions to occur. Mo® was exposed to MoFg
from room temperature to 850°C. The volatile products
MoFs, MoFs, and MoF,; were observed, and no
nonvolatile product was formed. Nb® ‘was exposed to
F, from ambient to 900°C. The volatile compound
NbFs; was formed. While F, is not a mild fluorinating
agent, the absence in this experiment of nonvolatile
fluorides is pertinent to the survey.

11.6.4 Infrared Spectroscopy
F. A.Grimm C.F. Weaver

Investigations have been started on the infrared
absorption spectrum of gaseous MoFs. G. M. Begun and
A. C. Rutenburg, Chemistry Division, have obtained
Raman spectra of solid and liquid MoFs and initiated
some studies on the infrared spectrum. Interpretation
of these spectra can lead to a better understanding of
the vapor phase and may also provide thermochemical

data.

The mjor dlfﬁculty is obtammg pur¢ MoFs (free of
any oxyfluoride species). The oxyfluorides of molyb-
denum are more volatile than the pentafluoride, so that
a small amount of impurity in the solid becomes a
major impurity in the gas phase. Even though' a pure
spectrum has not been obtained, it has been possible to
attribute some of the observed bands in the spectrum to
MoFs (see Fig. 11.12). The major lmpunty is believed
to be M00F4, and if this is the case it should be
possible to subtract the spectrum of M00F4 in order to
obtain the bands due only to MoFs. Work is now
proceedmg toward refining the required information.
The bands attributed to MoF; at this point in the
investigation are located’ at 510, 770, and approxi-
mately 700 cm ™, the exact locatlon bemg obscured by
a band due to oxyfluonde at 720 cm”

According to mass spectrometric studies of MoF;
(Sect. 11.4.3) there is a significant percentage of the
dlmer Mo, F,, in the vapor phase, so that one might
expect to observe the infrared spectrum of the dimer
along with the monomer. Further work on the lower-
frequency bands and interpretation of the infrared
spectrum is required before one will be in a position to
confirm this prediction. With respect to interpretation,
force field calculations based on the literature of
fluorides and chlorides wnth structures sumlar to MoF;

12. Properties of the Alkali Fluoroborates

12.1 MELTING POINTS AND SOLID
TRANSITION TEMPERATURES OF
ALKALI FLUOROBORATES

Stanley Cantor L. O. Gilpatrick

This investigation is part of a study which seeks to
systematically evaluate alkali fluoroborates as major
components of coolants for molten-salt breeder re-
actors.

Thermal transition temperature data. were obtained
by using previously reported! DTA techniques. Nickel
capsules were used as sample containers. The results,
which are believed to be accurate to *1°C, are listed in
Table 12.1; the melting point of LiBF,4 could be several
degrees higher, since samples of this salt were used as
received (from Foote Mineral Company) and may
contain impurities which depress the melting point. The
purity of the four other alkali fluoroborates is known
by chemical analyses to be excellent. The data for
NaBF4 and KBF, were previously obtained by Barton
and Gilpatrick.?

Solid-state transition temperatures for RbBF, and
CsBF, have not been previously reported. Melting
points of 590°C for RbBF, and 550°C for CsBF, were
observed by DeBoer and Van Liempt.* No previous
reports on the melting temperature of LiBF, were
found.

12.2 DENSITIES AND MOLAR VOLUMES OF
MOLTEN FLUOROBORATES

Stanley Cantor

Densities were measured in nickel vessels by means of
a dilatometric method, the details of which have been
published.’ - ‘

For all five alkali fluoroborates the observed densities
were linear with temperature. In each density run,
individual data points were obtained at approximately

equal temperature intervals. Table 12.2 3umniarizes_ the
data and includes a computer-fitted least-squares equa- -

tion for each melt. For all salts except LiBF, the
density. measurements are believed to be accurate to
within 0.3%, the major sources of error being uncer-
tainties in the initial calibration of the dilatometric
vessel (~0.1%) and in the irreversible expansion
(~0.2%) of the vessel as determined by recalibration.
The uncertainties for LiBF, are believed to be greater
(~2%) because of possible impurities in the samples
measured and because of the rather high decomposition
pressure of BF; over the melt.

oroborates, were calculated at two corresponding tem-
peratures; these are given in Table 12.3. The molar
volumes increase in the expected order; that is, the
larger the cation, the larger the molar volume. The
expansivities follow the same order, although the
expansivity of CsBF, is only slightly greater than that
of RbBF,. Table 12.3 also compares the iodides with
the fluoroborates at equal corresponding temperatures.
In molar volume, fluoroborate is always slightly larger
than the iodide. However, the expansivities of the
fluoroborates are, except for LiBF4, considerably
greater; for example, the expansivity of CsBF, is about

30% greater than that of Csl. It is quite possible that .

the internal vibrations of the (BF4)~ ion account for

the divergence of expansivities between fluoroborates .

and iodides. . -

12.3 PREDICTED VOLUME CHANGES IN
CRYSTALLINE ALKALI FLUOROBORATES

- Stanley Cantor

The four heavier alkali fluoroborates, NaBF,;, KBF,,
RbBF,, and CsBF,, exhibit a first-order phase transi-
tion in the solid state. Only: for the case of KBF, has
high-temperature * x-ray diffraction investigation®
elucidated the transition; in KBF 4, the low-temperature
orthorhombic form changes to the high-temperature
(283°C) cubic form. Above this transition temperature
the volume of KBF, is 15% greater than that at room
temperature. KCIO,, isomorphous to KBF,, undergoes
the same transition, also with a 15% increase in volume.
The analogies in structure between KBF, and KClO,,
and the assumption of similar structural changes for
NaBF,, RbBF,, and CsBF,, lead to the following
conjectures: (a) the four heavier alkali fluoroborates all
have the same -crystallographic transition, that is, a
change from  tetramolecular - orthorhombic to tetra-
molecular cubic unit cells at the transition temperature,
and (b) the volume change of this crystallographic
transition parallels the known volume change of the
corresponding alkali perchlorates. Thus in obtaining the
estimated values in the fourth column of Table 12.4 we
multiply . the : room-temperature molar ‘volumes of
NaBF,, RbBF,, and CsBF4 by the ratio of cell volumes
for the two' forms of NaClO,, RbClO,, and CsClO4
(obtaining the ratios from Wyckoff’s compilation®).

- The predicted volume changes at the solid transition

~ are all quite large — an 18% increase for NaBF,, 11%
- for RbBF,4, and 10% for CsBF,. Although these volume

changes are to be considered as speculative estimates, it
is noteworthy that there are no reports of the growth

- from the pure melt of large orthorhombic or cubic

crystals of these salts. The difficulty in growing large
crystals this way is probably associated with the large

12.4 REFRACTIVE INDICES AND ELECTRONIC
POLARIZABILITIES IN CRYSTALLINE
ALKALI FLUOROBORATES

‘ Stanley Cantor

The electronic polarizability is a valuable property for
understanding the interactions of relatively large and
complicated ions such as BF; . The refractive indices
of the alkali fluoroborates were therefore measured to
quantitatively determine the polarizability of BF, ~ ion.

Indices of refraction were measured at room tempera-
ture by the oil immersion method. By filtering (filters
manufactured by Bausch and Lomb, Inc., Rochester,
New York) the white-light source of the microscope,
indices of refraction were measured at three wave-

lengths, 4500, 5893, and 6500 A. The indices of the

fluoroborates are given in Table 12.5. The values at A =
5893 A were measured directly. For the indices at A =
o, the Cauchy equation, N = 4 + B[\?, was extrapo-
lated to A = oo, using the observed indices at the three
wavelengths. As can be noted in Table 12.5 the optical
anisotropy for each salt is rather small. In the case of
KBF, the indices of refraction (at constant A) differ by
.less than 0.001. For NaBF,; and KBF, the measured
indices agreed with those in the literature;’ for CsBF,

a,, are listed in Table 12.6. Also in Table 12.6, in the

last two columns, are the electronic polarizabilities of
the cations (a,) and fluoroborate anion (a_). These
were obtained from the simple additivity relatlonsmp,

The molecular polarizabilities of the alkali flu-
oroborates are approximately the same as those of the

corresponding alkali chlorides.® Since molar volumes of

alkali fluoroborates are similar to those of .alkali
iodides, one might have expected molecular polariza-
bilities to exhibit the same similarity. It seems quite
probable that the polarizability of BF4 ™ is less than
that of iodide because of the extensive localization of
electrons in B—F bonds.

A noteworthy feature of a_, the electronic polariza-
bility of BF4, is that it does not remain constant
among the alkali fluoroborates; instead, «_ decreases

with the increasing size of the cation. Stated somewhat -

differently, the higher the polarization of the cation the

lower the polarization of the fluoroborate ions. Similar

trends can be observed for alkali sulfates, nitrates, and
cyanides (see Table V of ref. 9). Evidently anions whose
electron-charge distributions are nonspherical (e.g.,
tetrahedral BF4~ and S04%", trigonal NO3™) possess
polarizabilities that:change with the cation. By contrast,
spherical halide ions exhibit polarizabilities that remain

approximately constant with varying cations. These
trends in the polarizability of nonspherical anions

- probably reflect the decreasing order of covalency in

cation-anion bonds; for example, Li* distorts (or
polarizes) the electronic charge of BF,™ in the direction
of the Li—F bond axis more than does Na* in the Na—F

. bond axis.

12.5 DECOMPOSITION PRESSURES AND
Sgg 8 of LiBF4

Stanley Cantor

The published information on the decomposition
reaction LiBF4(¢) = LiF(c) + BF;(g) contains two
widely different values for the enthalpy of reaction: (a)
AH° = 3.8 kcal/mole derived from a plot of log P vs
1/T,'° and (b) AH35s = 21.4 kcal obtained from
reaction calorimetry.!! Although the latter is almost
certainly the correct enthalpy, we measured the de-
composition pressures to confirm that AH° was indeed
about 21.4 kcal/mole; more importantly, we wished to
use the vapor pressure data to obtain S50g for
LiBF4(c). Using the previous study on decomposition
pressure, Greenwood and Martin'2? calculated that
S20g for LiBF,4(s) is 62.9 cal deg™ mole™, a value
which they thought was “surprisingly high.”

Decomposition pressures were determined in a nickel
vessel which was connected to one arm of a manometer.
Pressure readings were corrected for altitude, latitude,
and the thermal expansion of mercury. Prior to the
vapor pressure measurements, the apparatus (including
the sample) was evacuated for at least 15 hr at ~100°C.
Temperatures were measured with an NBS-calibrated
Pt-Rh thermocouple positioned in a nickel thermowell
which extended into the sample; the thermowell was
welded into the nickel vessel.

Two types of samples were measured. One was pure
LIBF4 ; the second was a 1:1 mixture of LiBF,4 and LiF
which had been kept for several hours in a closed vessel
at ~350°C (304°C is the melting point of LiBF,!3).
The purpose of the second sample was to determine

in solid LiBF;. The sources of the chemicals were:
LiBF4 — Foote Mineral Company, Exton, Pennsylvania;
LiF (“Baker Analyzed” reagent) — J. T. Baker Chermcal

' Company, Phillipsburg, New Jersey.

‘The vapor pressure data are given in the first two
columns of Table 12.7. A computer-fitted least-squares
equataon for these data is:

The standard error in R In P is 0.0549 cal deg™

The log P vs 1/T plot of the data (Fig. 12.1) shows
that samples of LiBF, and of LiBF, + LiF fit on the
same line, Therefore -there is no perceptlble solld
solubility of LiF in LiBF,.

The third-law analysis of the data yielded AHZ 55 =
22,95 '+ 0.2 kcal/mole. The probable reason for this
value being higher than the calorimetric value (21.40
0.09) is that the estimated free energy function for
L1BF4 is too high. For instance at 496.45°K, (G

H3o s)lT of L1BF4 was estimated as —34.23 cal deg“

G.D.Brunton S. Cantor

To obtain a reasonably reliable value for the density
of crystalline LiBF4, the powder diffraction pattern
was measured with the salt enclosed in a glass capillary.
Cell parameters were derived by assigning Miller indices
to the observed lines from the comparable reflections of
the LiClO, structure.!® LiBF, is orthorhombic, with a
tetramolecular unit cell of dimensions:

a=8.65+0.08A,
b=6.841+007A,
c=484+0.03A.
The density of LiBF, is, therefore, 2.17 + 0.06
glem®. |
The above results should be considered as a prelimi-

nary measurement since there are some uncertainties
about the purity and crystal size of the sample.

12.7 MIXING REACTIONS OF MSBR FUEL AND
COOLANT SALTS

D.M. Moulton  J. H. Shaffer

It has been known for some time that there is a wide
range of liquid-liquid immiscibility in the system of
LiFBeF,-ThF4 and NaBF; and that the fluorides of
uranium and the trivalent lanthanides are insoluble in
the latter salt.'® There seemed to be a possibility,
however, that divalent rare earths would distribute to
some extent into the fluoroborate phase, since it is a
good acceptor of ions of low charge density, and that
this might find use in a reprocessing scheme.

To test this, 0.98 kg of LiF-BeF,-ThF, (68-20-12
mole %) with 0.75 g of EuF; and 7 g of UF, was mixed
with 1.61 kg of NaBF4-NaF (92-8 mole %) at 538°C.
An Ar—3% BF; sparge gas was used to establish a BF,
pressure. Three additions of thorium metal were made
to reduce the europium to the divalent state. There was
no way to see the phase separation directly, but the
analyses of the dipper samples of the two salts showed
very different compositions. Data for this experiment
are shown in Table 12.8. As expected, the extraction of
both uranium and europium increased on reduction,
but neither got high enough to be very useful in
processing. The increased thorium distribution is hard
to explain. The very large amount of beryllium moving
to the fluoroborate despite its high charge density
suggests 2 bona fide BeF42” ion in that salt.

The most interesting observation in the experiment is
not the extraction but rather the mixing behavior of the
two salts. As soon as the salts were mixed, the total
pressure rose to 12 psig, presumably by BF; evolution.
The pressure was reduced periodically during the
experiment by bleed-off but rose regularly to at least
2-3 psig when the system was closed. There appears to
be a very substantial destabilization of the BF, ion
when Li, Be, or Th ions enter the fluoroborate phase,
caused, for example, by such reactions as

BeF,; + 2BF 4 - BeF.;z' + 2BF3 s
although there is no way to distinguish the mdmdual

effects of the three cations. Probably all of them have a.

destabilizing effect, and for lithium and thorium, at
least, it is questionable whether the effect is caused by
the formation of a specific complex species.

Bamberger found in thorium-free systems that the
equality -

Nypir t NygF =Npp, + 2Vg,F,

held reasonably well and suggested that the system
might be regarded as a reciprocal mixture of Na*, Li*,
BF,;", and BeF,?". In our case the relationship works
only if the term 4.5(Wypr, + Nur,) is added to the
right-hand side. We have shown the quantity N ;g +
Nnar — Ny — 2Nper, — 4.5(NthF, t+ Nur,) as
“Sum” in the table. The coefficient 4.5, which works
better than either 4 or S5, implies that the average
coordination number for thorium is 8.5. The data from
this experiment do not allow distinguishing between a
“physical” (Coulombic) and a “chemical” (complexing)
mechanism for BF; displacement, and in any case the
greatest difference between these may be semantic.
Development of a leak in the MSBR heat exchanger
and subsequent mixing of fuel and coolant salt would
result in an increase in the partial pressure of BF3 over

the salt mixture. Smith and Smith!? found that :
unexpectedly high pressures were required to suppress -

cavitation in operation of a fluoroborate test loop that

had ‘previously contained LiF-BeF,- ThF,-UF,. Con-

tamination of the fluoroborate salt by small amounts of
residual LiF-BeF;-ThF4-UF; undoubtedly accounted

for the unexpectedly high vapor pressure above the salt.

On replacing the salt with a clean charge the pressure
returned to normal. Any leakage of coolant into the
fuel salt would cause similar behavior at the fuel pump,

since BF3 is not very soluble in the MSBR fuel salt.

The degree of contamination of the fuel salt by heat
exchanger leakage is hard to assess. NaF will dissolve
readily. BF3 will be quite volatile and should strip out,
but whether it gets to a high enough rate to affect
nuclear performance must be a function of the leak and
stripping rates, of which the latter cannot yet be
calculated. Copious amounts of BF; could emerge in
the gas stream. Gross contamination would require
reprocessing of the salt streams, possibly by increasing
the BF3 pressure and lowering the temperature to give
maximum phase separation. Of the fission products,
one would expect Rb and Cs, and possibly some of the
Sr and Ba, to go to the fluoroborate phase, while rare
earths, actinides, Zr, and other highly charged species
would remain in the fuel salt. Most of the uranium
should be recoverable in this way. Further studies of
the fluoride-fluoroborate system are in progress.

12.8 PHASE RELATIONS IN THE
SYSTEM NaF-KF-BF,

C.J.Barton L.O.Gilpatrick H. Insley

We reported earlier' ® that we had been unable to find
the minimum-melting composition in the system
NaFKF-BF; that theoretically should exist on the
boundary between the NaF and the NaBF4-KBF, solid
solution fields. At this composition the liquidus and
solidus temperatures should coincide as they do at the
minimum melting composition in the NaBF,-KBF,
quasi-binary system. We continued this search, concen-
trating our effort on compositions near the NaF-NaBF,
binary eutectic and the NaBF,-KBF, minimum. The
DTA data in this part of the system, including some
information previously reported,'® are displayed in
Table 12.9.

. These data show that there is a small region defined

by the limits (in mole %) 48.5 + 1.0 NaF, 3.5 £ 0.5 KF,
and 48.0 = 0.5 BF3, where the liquidus and solidus
temperatures are essentially constant with an average
spread of 5° between the two values. It should be noted
that quenching data for several compositions in or near
this composition range show liquid persisting below
372°C, but the amount is believed to be small and may
be attributed to the presence of a small amount of
oxygen in the system. This effect may also help to
account for our failure to find a composition with a

smaller spread between liquidus and solidus tempera-
tures. We have observed that the purest NaBF, that we
have been able to produce melted over a range of 10°C
when heated in the DTA apparatus under the same
conditions used to obtain the data in Table 12.9, and
this compound makes up a large fraction of all these
preparations. We believe that further study of this
system is not likely to reveal a composition melting at a
temperature significantly lower than that of the
NaF-NaBF, eutectic composition (384°C). A phase
diagram for this system that incorporates information

obtained since the publication of an earlier version!? is
shown in Fig. 12.2,

129 PREPARATION OF PURE NaBF,
C.J.Barton L.O. Gilpatrick

Part of our fluoroborate study has been devoted to
preparation of pure NaBF,; because we need pure
material for phase studies and preparation of an
oxygen-free product has not been easily achieved. The
technique that gave the highest-melting compound yet
prepared, passing a mixture of BF3;, HF, and helium
through molten NaBF,, was used to prepare another
batch of this compound. This time the entire BF3-HF
treatment ‘was carried out at 425°C, whereas in the
earlier trial the treatment was performed first at 500°C
and then at 425°C. The resulting product melted at
406°C, as compared with 408°C for the earlier prepa-
ration. It appears that a higher temperature or more
prolonged treatment at the lower temperature may be
required for complete oxygen removal. The product
was stored in a glass bottle after grinding to pass an
80-mesh sieve. After several months the bottle was

observed to be etched, and the powder had caked quite
badly. We believe that HF or free BF; remaining in the

product after cooling to room temperature was respon-

sible for both phenomena.

We found earlier that recrystallization of NaBF, from
0.5 or 1 M HF solution gave a fairly pure product. In an
~ effort to produce oxygen-free NaBF, we dissolved
NaBF, recrystallized from dilute HF in concentrated
(48%) HE. Chemical analysis of the first crop of crystals
that separated from the cold concentrated HF solution
showed it to be a mixture of NaBF, and NaF-HF.

- One portion of a subsequent crop of crystals, after
heating under a vacuum at about 150°C, gave an
analysis that corresponded closely to the theoretical
values for NaBF4. The oxygen content of this material
was 200 ppm, as low as any NaBF, prepared to date,
but it was reported to contain 500 ppm H, 0. The other
portion of this crop contained 340 ppm oxygen and
300 ppm H,O after 24 hr in a vacuum desiccator at

room temperature. This technique may warrant further

investigation for the laboratory-scale preparation of
pure NaBF,.

12.10 ATTEMPTED SYNTHESIS OF NaBF,0H

L.O. Gilpatrick  C.J. Barton .

Hydroxyfluoroborates are of interest because they are
hydrolysis products of the tetrafluoroborates and they
will undoubtedly increase the corrosiveness of flu-
oroborate coolant materials. The successful synthesis of
KBF30H by the reaction

2KHF, +H;B0; 25 KBF,0H + KF + 2H,0

130

was reported earlier.?® We .attempted to make
NaBF;0H by a similar technique, but the product
contained two phases in approximately equal amounts.
One was NaBF, and the other had a higher refractive
index and was assumed to be the desired product,
NaBF; OH. We attempted to separate the two products
by dissolving the NaBF, in hot acetone or a mixture of
acetone and water, but the separation was not com-
plete. We then found that addition of an organic amine
to hot acetone resulted in complete solution of the
NaBF,, but a small amount of NaF was present in the
residue. This was removed by dissolving the product in
a small amount of water, filtering off the slightly
soluble NaF, and recrystallizing the product by slowly
evaporating the water. The resulting product appeared

to be single-phase material when examined under the

microscope. It had a refractive index of about 1.355, as
compared to 1.305 for NaBF,. Its chemical analysis
corresponded very closely to the empirical formula

"NaBF, 0. When heated for the first time in a sealed

nickel capsule in the DTA apparatus, a large thermal
effect was observed at about 408°C, near the melting
point of NaBF,, but subsequent thermal cycling re-
vealed no significant thermal effects. When the capsule
was opened at room temperature and examined under
the microscope, the material was found to consist of
NaF embedded in a glassy, watersoluble phase. Efforts
to use infrared absorption to identify the NaBF,0
compound, a formulation that does not appear to exist
in the literature, have not as yet produced useful
results. We plan to try other methods of making
NaBF;0H, and we will also try to characterize the

-product we made, since it has apparently not been

previously reported

13.1 PHASE RELATIONS IN THE SYSTEM
LiF-BeF, -CeF,

C.J.Barton L.O. Gilpatrick H. Insley

As pért of a long-range study of phase relations in the
system LiF-BeF,-ThF,-CeF;, which will allow pre-
diction of the behavior of PuF,; in LiF-BeF,-ThF,

‘mixtures, we prepared nine mixtures in the system

LiF-BeF; -CeF3. Our immediate objective was to estab-
lish the temperature and composition of the BeF, -CeF,
eutectic, but the viscosity of BeF, -rich compositions at
temperatures below the melting point of BeF,
(555°C) is believed to be too high to permit ready
attainment of equilibrium. Thoma ef al.'! made small

" additions of NaF to BeF,-ThF4 mixtures to lower the

viscosity and to speed the attainment of equilibrium in
the determination of the BeF,-ThF, eutectic ternpera-
ture and composition, but we chose to add LiF rather
than NaF because of the need to establish phase
relations in the ternary system LiF-BeF,-CeF3. The
CeF3 solubility work of Ward et al.? established
liquidus temperatures for compositions in this system
containing 28.5 to 48.4 mole % BeF,.

The mixtures were prepared by weighing the required
amounts of ground, distilled BeF,, LiF, and CeF, into
graphite crucibles, adding NH,F-HF, and heating to
about 800°C in a flowing helium atmosphere. Some of
the BeF, distilled out of the crucibles during this
process, and all the fused mixtures were weighed after
cooling to room temperature in order to measure the
loss in weight before grinding. Since LiF and CeF3 have
low vapor pressures at 800°C, the weight loss was
assumed to be due entirely to evaporation of BeF,.

Analyses of two compositions now available do not |

- agree with the values calculated on this assumption. .

Portions of the ground mixtures were sealed' in
gradient quench tubes and heated for 21 days before
quenching. The results of this prelumnary mvestlgatlon
can be summarized as foIlows

- 1. BeF, was observed as the primary phase (at 547 C)

in only one mixture, LlF-Bng LeF; (0.6-97.9-1.5
mole % by analysis).

2. Liquidus temperatures in ihe CeF; primary phase

field increase rapidly with increasing CeF3 content,
as might be expected from the very hlgh melting
point (1460°C) of CeF;.

3. The temperature of appearance of two crystalline
phases (CeF3; and BeF;) in equilibrium with liquid
was surprisingly reproducible, falling in the range

. 538 + 3°C for seven mixtures. This is probably near
the BeF, -CeF; eutectic temperature.

4. Evidence of liquid immiscibility (two glasses) was
noted in two compositions, that listed under item 1
above and LiF-BeF,-CeF3 (0.5-86.1-9.5 mole % by
analysis), in the approximate temperature range 570
to 540°C,

- Tests now under way will show whether equilibrium
in BeF;-rich BeF, -CeF53 compositions can be achieved
by a long equilibration period.

13.2 HETEROGENEOUS EQUILIBRIA BETWEEN
CERIUM-CONTAINING MOLTEN FLUORIDES AND
OXIDE PHASES

C. F. Baes, Ir.

In search of an alternative method for removal of
rare-earth fission products from MSBR fuels, we have
begun a series of experiments to synthesize sparingly
soluble compounds containing rare earths which could
act as selective ion exchangers for such fission products.
The initial tests have involved as starting materials
various oxides which our experience and/for available
thermochemical data3 suggest might be stable or nearly

solid solution, Ln3" cations might also enter the oxide
lattice by releasing one U** cation and oxidizing one

- U™ lattice cation to US* (Table 13.2, reaction 5).

AL, O; is of interest and was included in these initial
tests not only because it forms congruently melting
compounds with rare-earth oxides but also because it,
along with SiO,, is a principal component of zeolite—
molecular sieve materials which could act as ion
exchangers.

The experimental techmque consisted in stlrrmg 0.1
mole or more of the oxide starting material with ~500
g of fluoride melt of a composition near LiF-BeF,-
ThF, (72-16-12 mole %) in a leak-tight stirred vessel®
under argon or a mixture of argon—4% hydrogen.
Cerium ﬂuonde, usually 0.05 mole, was added as the
representatwe rare earth because of the convenience of
the tracer '**Ce which was incorporated into the
fluoride mixture together with inert CeF3. The concen-

tration of cerium in filtered samples was determined -

radiometrically with a precision of #3%. Occasionally,

- samples of the solid phase were taken, and the stable

solid compounds present were determined by x-ray and
petrographic methods. ThO, was generally added to
supply oxide ions. ' ‘

- The various tests are summanzed in Table 13 3

1.. The equilibration of ‘a melt containing CeF3 with
'8i0; + ThSiO, with ThSiO, + ThO, at 700°C did
not produce a detectable cerium removal. The
‘ThSi0, was synthesized from ThO, and SiO,

- during these equilibrations, confirming the expected
stability of this phase.

2 A UO,-ThO, solid solution dilute in UOQ, seemed to
" produce a slight removal of cerium from a fluoride
~ phase containing a low concentration of cerium
. (XCeF ~3 X 107*). A UO,-ThO, solid solution

rich m UO; caused the removal of much more
* cerium, but after cooling none was found associated
-with the oxide phase. Similarly, in a subsequent
experiment at a higher concentration of cerium in
the fluoride melt (Xcep, ~7 X 107%), no cerium
removal was detected, and no cerium activity was
found in the separated oxide phase, even when NiO
. was added to favor reaction 5 in Table 13.2. At
present we have no explanation for the removal of
cerium observed in the earlier test.

3. Cr,0; with or without ThO, did not show any

cerium extraction (Table 13.2, reaction 1). This ox-

~ ide was found to be stable, as expected. Indeed, it is

' probable that the amount of chromium dissolved in

the melt (Table 13.3) was much lower than the

analytical value because of incomplete removal of

" Cry04 from the filtered samples. On the chance that

the concentration of chromium in the melt at

~equilibrium was low enough to cause slow kinetics,

13.2 produced a small amount of cerium removal,
though again the precipitated phase was not estab-
lished. With both NiO and ThO, present, the
amount of Fe?* found in solution was in excellent
agreement with the predicted value (Table 13.1).

5. The equilibration of V, 05 with a cerium-containing
melt together with NiO and ThO, (reaction 3, Table
~ 13.2) showed some cerium removal, and then more
removal when the amount of V05 was increased
and the temperature was raised above the melting
point of V;05 (~670°C). After termination of this
run, extensive corrosion of the nickel thermocouple
well was found. We attribute this to mass transfer of
nickel caused by the formation of an NiO-V,Os
liquid phase. In a future test, the addition of NiO
will be omitted. The low vanadium concentrations
found in samples of the fluoride melt tend to
confirm the predicted stability of V,O0s. Again,
these values are thought to be high because of
incomplete separation of the V, 05 phase from the
filtered sample.

6. AL,O, was found to react completely with the
- fluoride melt to produce solid ThO,. Analysis of

filtered samples showed large amounts of dissolved
AIF; and, below 700°C, composition changes which
indicated the separation of a fluoride phase rich in
LiF, ThF,, and AlF;, and containing some cerium,

- The instability of Al,O; plus the fact that the
AL, 0;Si0, phase diagram shows no high-melting
intermediate phase suggests that zeolite (Al,03-
Si0,) ion exchangers would also be unstable in the
presence of molten fluorides.

While thus far these tests have revealed no oxide
material which could act as an effective agent for
rare-earth removal from molten LiF-BeF,-ThF, fluo-
rides, V,05 shows enough promise to warrant further

~study. Another important result is that we have

confirmed the expected stability of these oxides in the
presence of molten fluorides. Cr, 03, even though of no
apparent use as an extractant for rare earths, may prove
useful as a container or insulator material for MSBR
fluorides. We have not exhausted the list of oxide
materials which form double oxides with rare earths
and which might be stable or nearly stable in molten

fluorides. Among the oxides soon to be tested, in

addition to further tests of _V,Os, are TiO,, Zr(__),,

u
 

Nb, O, TayOs, and MoO,. In these tests rare earths
heavier than cerium (whose tracer '#*Ce we have used
as an analytical convenience) will be present, since these
should have a greater tendency to form the desired
double-oxide phases.

133 LIQUIDUS TEMPERATURES IN THE SYSTEM
LiF-BeF, -ThF,

C.J.Barton L.O.Gilpatrick
H. Insley

During the course of fractional crystallization studies
of LiF-BeF,-ThF,-CeF; mixtures described in the
previous report,” it was observed that the liquidus
temperature of the mixture having the composition
LiF-BeF,-ThF, (60-28-12 mole %, average of four
analyses; calculated composition 58-30-12 mole %) was
at least 50°C higher than predicted by the published
phase diagram.® It seemed worth while, therefore, to
redetermine liquidus temperatures of several composi-
tions in this system that have been, or may be, of
interest for use in breeder reactors. The measurements
were made by use of the gradient quenching and DTA
techniques. The results are recorded in Table 13.4. The
liquidus values for the 72 and 68 mole % LiF mixtures,
in the composition range presently favored for MSBR
use, are in fair agreement with literature values.
However, the new values for the 64 and 58 mole % LiF
compositions show that they are not suitable for
reactor use and that the range of LiF-BeF, solvent
compositions for such use is not as wide as the
published phase diagram indicates. |

The phases observed in the quenched samples agreed,
in general, with the predictions of the published
diagram, but some thermal effects were observed in the

'DTA curves that could not be explained by the
‘quenching data. This is probably due to the fact that
~ the quenching technique gives equilibrium data, where-

as DTA is a dynamic process.

13.4 THE SOLUBILITY OF THORIUM IN
THORIUM TETRAFLUORIDE

A.S.Dworkin M. A, Bredig

Thermal analysis measurements were made to de-
termine the eutectic temperature in the Th-ThF,
system, and through combination with the entropy of
fusion of ThF,4, the solubility of Th in ThF,;. The
eutectic temperature was found to be only 1 to 2°
lower than the melting point (1110°C) of ThF,,
indicating a solubility of about 0.1 to 0.2 mole % Th in
ThF, . This is of the same low order of magnitude as the
solubility in 3LiF-ThF, and as the solubilities of La,
Ce, and Nd in their respective trifluorides, which we
had measured earlier. :

The low solubility of Th in ThF, indicates that the
formation of a stable trivalent thorium fluoride in any
appreciable concentration is unlikely.

13.5 POTENTIOMETRIC DETERMINATION OF
THE U*/U?* RATIO IN MOLTEN
FLUORIDES

D

The Ni, NiO, BeO reference electrode was compart-
mented by using a silica liner inserted in a nickel tube.
The silica and nickel tubes contained frits of ~10 u
pore size. Experiments so far have been carried out in
the two fluoride mixtures LiF-BeF, -UF4 (66-33-1 mole
%) and LiF-BeF,-ZiF4-UF,; (64-32-3-1). The time
required for the reference electrode to reach a stable
potential, once the reference electrode assembly is
immersed in the melt, is 1 to 4 hr. Although the silica
compartments are slowly attacked by the fluoride
melts, they usually last from two to four weeks.

Measurements were made at 610° by reducing U¥
to U with either beryllium or zirconium metal, then
oxidizing with weighed increments of anhydrous NiF,.
As indicated by the cell potential, a period of about 30
min was required for complete reaction of a typical
40-mg addition of NiF, . In earlier experiments we tried
to reduce the U** to U* incrementally by the addition
of weighed amounts of beryllium or zirconium metal to
the melt; however, beryllium additions gave erratic
results, and while zirconium gave more reproducible
results, the time required for complete reaction of
zirconium with the melt was often several hours. It is
possible that in these early experiments some of our
difficulties may have been caused by beryllium or
zirconium metal alloying with the nickel container
vessel. Hence, for the initial reduction of melts in the
present measurements, we have followed a procedure of
carefully exposing the beryllium or zirconium metal to
the melt without touching the container walls and then
removing it when the desired potential was reached.

Results of several oxidation runs are shown as plots of
log Xy /XUF4) vs the cell potential Ey in Fig. 13.1.
The initial value of the ratio X urs/Xur, in each series
of measurements was adjusted so that subsequent,
lower ratios derived from the amounts of NiF, oxidant
added produced plots which were, as nearly as possible,
linear and of the theoretical slope expected from the
simple Nernst expression '

This procedure was based on the assumption that the
NiF, added had oxidized only UF; and was consumed
by no other reducing agent. With the precautions cited
above regarding the use of beryllium and zirconium
metal in the initial reductions, this appeared to be a
valid assumption since a suitable adjustment of the
initial Xyp,/Xyp, ratio did indeed produce linear
plots of the expected slope. The plots for all runs at
both melt compositions were essentially the same,
giving

expect E; to show an appreciable difference at the two

we would expect Ej for the two melts to differ by ~38
mv. The absence of a detectable difference in Ei for the
two melts suggests that they both have about the same
free fluoride ion activity, which is quite surprising since
the presence of 3 mole % Z1F, in one melt is expected
to appreciably lower the concentration of free fluoride
ion. The effect, or lack of effect, of melt COmpOSltlon
on E} will be examined further.

Another surprising result is that the observed value of
E} differs some 85 mv (Fig. 13.1) from the values of £}
which may be derived by combining the measurements
for reactions II, IIl, and the following previously
reported® cell reaction: :

Thus E7 should be given by

E} =Ejy — Ejyy — Ey; = 1.291 - 0.1577/10° ,  (4)
and at 610°C Ej should be 1.147 v. Since one of the
present melt compositions is quite close to 2LiF-BeF,,
wherein £ must equal £] by definition, the difference
between the observed value of Ej and the predicted
value of E] cannot be attributed to medium effects
alone. Th1s discrepancy prompted us to recheck our
previous potentiometric measurements of cell IV,?

Be® IL]F —BeF, ||L1F ,BeF, INIO(C) BeO(c) |N1 W)

The results over a temperature range of 500 to 7009C

confirmed our earlier data. Thus we have no explana-
tion for the inconsistency but plan to mvestlgate it

~ further.

Measurements of cell I so far indicate that the Ni,
NiO, BeO electrode should be a satisfactory reference
electrode for the potentiometric determination of the
UY/U* ratio in LiF-BeF, melts. The reproducibility
thus far obtained (Fig. 13.1) suggests that accuracy of

137

the order of £5% can be attained in the determination
of this ratio once the value of E' has been established
accurately from known U*/U*' ratios in the melt
composition of interest.

13.6 REFINEMENT OF THE UF,; SPECTRUM
L.M.Toth

Successful development of diamond-windowed spec-
trophotometric cells'? hasenabled us to maintain stable
molten salt solutions of UF3 and thereby to initiate a
study of the absorption spectra in LiF-BeF, -UF; melts.
The spectrum of UF; in LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %) was
investigated with the concentration of UF; = 0.3 mole
%. The spectrum of UF; from 650 to 2500 mu was
found to agree well with the set of values reported
previously.!® The measured absorption coefficient!* at
890 mu was 40 liters mole™ cm™ (cf. eg90 = 42
previously!?).

The region from 250 to 650 my, however, does not
agree with the previous UF; spectrum. The peak
positions are identical, but their intensities are greater
by approximately a factor of 2. In particular €340 Was
found to be 860 liters mole™ cm™ (cf. €350 = 440
liters mole ™ cm™).13

This new value of €350 = 860 liters mole ™ cm™ is
consistent with what is expected by comparing spectra

of U* in nonfluoride systems. 13 This refinement of €
at 360 mu was achieved by comparing relative absorb-
ances at 360 and 890 my in the same spectrum. Thus,
using Beer’s law, '

Ase0 Easo!?{
Agoo €s9oﬂ{

AszgofAgeo Was measured, and €390 Was calculated
from concentrated UF; solutions. With these values

 

‘€360 Was calculated from the above equation.

The importance of measuring relative absorbances of
the two peaks should be stressed. A spectrum that
checks in this manner is referred to here as internally

-consistent. The details of the method used as well as the

corrected UF; spectrum will be reported later.

@Private communication with J. P. Young,

This correction is of particular MSR interest because
of its effect on UF;/UF, ratios measured spectro-
photometrically. Applying the correction to UF;/UF,
determinations where the 360-my peak was used would
reduce the previous values to approximately % their

value. For example, Table 15.1 of Sect. 15.2 (this -

report) would be corrected as shown in Table 13.5.

In every case where the 360-mu peak was used (values
a, b, and ¢), better agreement is achieved by applying
the correction. Although the value for 2 was below the
detection limits of the instrument,!® the correction is
still legitimate. Furthermore it demonstrates that the
sensitivity limit of the spectrophotometric method is at
least one-half that which would be anticipated from the
old value in the table. No correction was applied to d
because the 890-mu peak was used. The net result of
the 360-mu absorption coefficient correction is better
agreement of the spectrophotometric method with the
other two methods. .

Base-line uncertainty and light scatter can account for
approximately 10% error in €3¢ = 860. Further
refinement within this 10% uncertainty is foreseen and
will be reported as these sources of error are examined.

137 EMF MEASUREMENTS WITH |
CONCENTRATION CELLS WITH TRANSFERENCE
* IN MOLTEN MIXTURES OF LiF AND BeF,

K. A.Romberger J. Braunstein

As part of a general investigation orientated toward
characterizing ionic mobilities in fused salts, emf
measurements are being made in the LiF-BeF, system
which employ the concentration cell with transference

 

LiF || LiF
Be| BeF, || BeF; | Be. (D)

The initial results from these measurements were
reported in the last report of this series.! © Therein emf
data (E,) were reported for 500 and 610°C which were
obtained with an all-silica cell. The results over a limited
range suggested that the transference number of lithium
ion relative to fluoride ion was unity.

Measurements have now been extended over w:der
ranges of composition and temperature employing both
silica and recently developed all-metal cells. The sensi-
tivity, stability, and ruggedness of the latter have been
demonstrated during several lengthy experiments. New
results include:

1. Isothermal measurements with silica apparatus at
700°C for compositions between 0.90 and 0.30
mole fraction BeF,.

2. Two different sets of isothermal measurements at
610°C utilizing an all-metal (nickel, molybdenum)
cell which covered compositions between 0.70 and

 the LiF liquidus at 0.267 mole fraction BeF,.

3. Measurements along the LiF liquidus between 610
and 800°C using the metal cell. |

4. Isothermal measurements at S00°C and constant-
composition measurements at temperatures between
500°C and the liquidus temperatures for BeF, and
Li;BeF, for compositions between 0.60 and 0.33
mole fraction BeF,. The latter experiment also
utilized the metal cell and is still in progress.

Here x is the mole fraction of beryllium ﬂuonde Our

previous measurements showed that £; ; equaled 1.00 £

005 for compositions between 0.3 and 0.5 mole
fraction BeF, at both temperatures. This result has

been confirmed by our subsequent measurements, not
only for 500 and 610°C but for 700°C as well.

The results are shown in more detail in Table 13.6,
where the values of #;; for discrete composition
intervals -have been calculated at various temperatures.

The uncertainty in #;; between 0.3 and 0.5 mole -

fraction BeF, is about 15%, while the un_eeetainty
between 0.5 and 0.7 mole fraction BeF, is about +20%.

BeF, because the relative error in AE, is too large to
give meaningful results, The £, values obtained recently
at 610 and 500°C with metal cells reproduce closely the
data obtained earlier at the same temperatures with
silica cells. The conclusion is that the materials of
construction of the cells did not influence the values of
E,. This is remarkable in that the nickel compartments
(which were electrically isolated from the rest of the
cell) always had potentials which were positive (noble)
relative to the beryllium electrodes from 0.4 to 1.2 v.
The smallest potential difference which has been seen
between a beryllium electrode and the separating
{metal) compartment is over 300 mv. Silica frits were of
much larger pore size (~150 u diameter) than the nickel
frits (~10 ¢ and ~40 ), showing that for this range of
pore diameters, E, was also independent of pore
diameter. _ _

Metal cells have a decided advantage over silica cells at
higher LiF compositions (x eF, less than 0.3) since
they are stable to the fluoride salts while silica is not.

- Moreover, the metal cells can be frozen without

concentration change or damage whereas the silica cells
break upon freezmg Using metal cells we have made
measurements along the LiF hquldus up to 800°C, the
upper . temperature limit of the furnace. We plan to
make more measurements in this high-LiF region in the
future, and the data which are presently avallable will
be presented at that time.

Metal cells have also yielded more precise emf values
than have silica celis for values of xg g, below ~0.55.
This precision is illustrated in Fig. 13.2, wherein data
are shown which were obtained between 365 and

500°C for compositions near the eutectic of the
LiF-BeF, system. The reference composition (II) is the
same throughout, xg ., = 0.5278. The labeled lines in
the homogeneous region identify the composition in
the bulk (I); the numerous points which form the
boundary (liquidus) curve where Li;BeF, begins to
precipitate have been derived from the various total
bulk compositions, and there is considerable overlap.
Since this boundary curve represents an invariant
composition point at any one temperature, it forms an
internal composition reference, If there is diffusion or
flow from the bulk into the reference compartment,
any unknown “aging” effects which affect the po-
tential, or an inability of the stirrer to maintain thermal
equilibrium in the presence of the precipitated solid,
the observed emf will deviate from the line. These
measurements were made over a period of two weeks,
with the entire system frozen six times in between. No
deviation was observed until the 0.5278-0.4267 com-
position couple was followed down to 392°C. Here the
deviation is ~1.1 mv or 0.8°C. At this point, it is
calculated that 40% of the total LiF and 27% of the
total BeF, in the bulk compartment were present as
precipitated LiBeF;. For the same concentration set
the deviation at 382°C was about 1.1°C or 1.0 mv.
Here, 49% of the total LiF and 33% of the total BeF,
were present as a solid precipitate. The temperature at
which the emf-temperature plot for any one composi-

tion set intersects the invariant boundary curve is the
liquidus temperature at that composition., These inter-
section points are obtainable with great precision,
usually about £0.2°C. The values for these liquidus data
are now being determined. They will be presented in
the next volume of this series.

Although the general purpose of these emf studies is
to aid in characterizing ionic transport properties, the
excellent reproducibility and long-term stability of the
all-metal cells indicate that they should have general
applicability to several types of problems. These in-
clude:

1. Very precise determination of liquidus curves in
binary, and possibly ternary, systems. We are pursu-
ing this application as is demonstrated by Fig. 13.2.

2. Routine analytical monitoring of compositions of
binary salts, For example, with the LiF-BeF, system
between about xp.p, = 0.40 and the LiF liquidus,
E, changes approximately 14 mv per mole percent
composition change. If a reference solution was
saturated with LiF (i.e., its composition would be
fixed) at any one temperature, then an emf uncer-
tainty even as large as *1.4 mv would yield
‘compositions precise to £0.001 mole fraction.

3. Reproducible and stable reference electrodes. Beryi-
lium rod electrodes, immersed in melts of the same
‘composition, in all-metal cells invariably show emf
 

 

 

differences of less than 0.3 mv. Usually the emf
differences are no more than 0.05 mv.

13.8 IMPROVED DETERMINATION OF
" ELECTRICAL CONDUCTANCE OF
LiF-BeF, (66-34 MOLE %)

G.D. Robbins = J. Braunstein

The first determinaﬁon of Speciﬁc conductance in the
current program of investigating . electrical con-
ductivities in systems of interest to the MSRP was that

of the MSRE coolant salt, LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %).'®

Using ‘a silica cell of refined design and an ac series-
component Wheatstone-type bridge (both previously
described!®), a more accurate determination of specific
conductance over an extended temperature range has
been obtained. These measurements extend the tem-
perature range investigated to 470—-645°C.

Starting material?® which had been previously treated
with H,/HF was remelted and filtered*' under a
helium atmosphere. The frozen salt was subsequently
loaded into the silica conductance cell in a dry box and
melted under dried helium. The sample melted com-
pletely clear, remained transparent for more than 13 hr,
appeared somewhat milky after 22 hr, and was cloudy
after two days. The open circle data shown in Fig. 13.3
were taken in random order during this period and
demonstrate the absence of effects from oxide formed
during the experiment.

Employing a silica cell of cell constant 150 42 cm
and a peak-to-peak applied voltage of 25 mv across the

-1

cell, measured resistance was independent of measuring -

frequency over the range 5 to 50 kHz within the
accuracy limits of the bridge (£0.2%). This was the first
fluoride melt to show no frequency dxspersmn, prob-
‘ably indicative of its high punty

Specific conductance data are given in Table 13.7.

139 ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITIES OF
LOW-MELTING NaF-BeF, MIXTURES

G. D Robbins  J. Braunstein

The Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher (VTF) equation as ap-
plied to equivalent conductance, A, in the form

k

has been successfully employed in binary nitrate melts
" to correlate the composition and temperature de-
pendence of electrical conductivity.>*2* In this rela-
tion T is the absolute temperature, while 4, k, and T,
are adjustable parameters. In the molten KNO;-
Ca(NO,), system Angell??+23 was able to determine
Ty, the zero-mobility temperature, for three glass-
forming compositions by analyzing the curvature in
plots of In A vs 1/T at temperatures below 2T,.
Employing the observed linear relationship between T
and mole fraction for these three compositions, Ty was
extrapolated to other compositions. The VTF equation
was then found to adequately represent the data
employing a single value of k, independent of composi-
tion. The extent to which this behavior obtains in other
systems is important in the correlation of electrical
conductance with composition. To test the applicability
of the VIF equation in correlating conductivities in
molten fluorides, an attempt has been made to deter-
mine T, for three low-melting mixtures in the molten
NaF-BeF, system.

The previously described ac Wheatstone-type bridge,
incorporating a series-component balancing arm, and
the type of silica conductance cells used in studies of
the LiF-BeF, system?S were employed in these experi-
ments. In the LiF-BeF, system it was possible to use
silica cells with the molten fluoride, due in part to the
slight solubility of BeO and low equilibrium partial

pressure of SiF4 formed via the corrosion reaction?®
2BeF, +8i0, = 2BeO + SiF, 1.

A similar procedure has been followed with the
NaF-BeF, system. The cell constant was determined to
be 92.96 cm™ (20.15% precision) relative to molten
potassium nitrate as a reference (accuracy = +0.5%).27
In all measurements the peak-to-peak voltage applied
across the conductance cell was maintained at 25 mv,
and the measured resistance was independent of the
measuring frequency over the range 5 to 50 kHz, within

the accuracy limits of the bridge (£0.2%).

Hand-picked, glass-clear crystals of recrystalllzed NaF
and sublimed BeF, were melted under an inert atmos-
phere in the conductance cell. Semiquantitative spec-
trographic analysis of the starting materials showed the

major impurities to be (in ppm by weight) for BeF,: 50

Li, 100 Na and for NaF: 2 Mg, 2 Fe, and 3 Ca.

The phase diagram®®:2? for the system NaF-Ber
shows two low-melting eutectics (340 and 365°C) at 43
and 55 mole % beryllium fluoride, with the compound
NaBeF; congruently melting at 376°C. Specific con-
ductances have been determined as functions of tem-
perature for these three compositions and are shown in
Fig. 13.4. Data are given in Table 13.8. The data were
taken in random order over several days, at each
composition, thus demonstrating the absence of time or
corrosion effects on the results. The curves shown were
calculated from computer-fitted least-squares equations
similar to the VIF equation. The upper portion of
Table 13.9 lists the parameter values, together with the
standard parameter errors and the standard errors of fit.

Density data from ref. 30 were converted to molar
volumes and computer fitted by linear expressions in
mole fraction at constant temperature. Discarding the
disparate data at 50 mole % BeF,, the linear least-
squares equations of molar volume as a function of
composition at various temperatures were employed to
interpolate to the desired compositions. Densities were
obtained by linear interpolation for the three composi-
tions of interest (the temperature variation of the

of Ty (Tp) are similar in magnitude to T obtained in
an LiF-BeF, mixture.2® Although the three NaF-BeF,
values of Ty (To) can be fitted by a line through the
error limits when plotted vs composition, there are as
yet insufficient data to define the relation between Ty
and composition accurately. While A’ and k' differ
significantly from A and k, T and T are comparable
in magnitude, and the variation of T and To with
composition is somewhat similar.

Based on values of T given in Table 13.9, the ratios
of melting temperatures to Ty (in degrees K) are 1.88,
2.13, and 2.05 for 43, 50, and 55 mole % BeF,
respectively. Since it did not prove possible to super-
cool these mixtures, probably due to the presence of
beryllium oxide, none of the data for 50 or 55 mole %
BeF, fall in the temperature range less than 274, while
only 3 of the 11 data at 43 mole % are below 2T,.

It might be assumed that the lower portions of the
temperature ranges covered should give a more accurate
— though less precise — estimate of Ty. However, as

_Table 13.11 demonstrates, estimates of T, based on the

lowest five data for each composition resulted in values

of considerable uncertainty, Hence, one must consider
the data in Table 13.9 the best estimates available for
this system. That k for two of the three compositions is
similar is encouraging. However, the results demonstrate
the necessity of further measurements in cells not
subject to fluoride attack. In addition, experiments are
currently in progress to determine the experimental
glass transition temperatures of these mixtures by
differential thermal analysis.

performed at Mound Laboratory, Miamisburg, Ohio, by
L. J. Wittenberg and R. Dewitt. Preparation of samples,
fabrication of capsules, and supplementary interpreta-
tion were done at ORNL.

The data, summarized in Table 13.12, were usually
collected over about a 100°C temperature interval. The
two salts composed of LiF-BeF,-ThF,; exhibit vis-
cosities rather close to salts where UF, is substituted

13.11 DENSITY OF MOLTEN FLUORIDES OF
REACTOR INTEREST

Stanley Cantor

The densities of several fluoride mixtures were meas-
ured dilatometrically,>* continuing the work reported
previously 3% The results are summarized in Table
13.13; the last three salt mixtures listed were also in the
last semiannual report.®®

* An interesting result, derived from the study of the
three ThF,-containing mixtures, was that expansivity

- (which is the fractional change of volume with tempera-

ture) showed little change with the concentrations of
BeF, and of ThF, . The results are given in Table '13.14.
Assuming that the concentration of LiF in the fuel melt
‘of an MSBR will be approximately 70 mole %, then
these results suggest that the MSBR fuel mixture will
have an expansivity very close to 2.5 X 107™*/°C.

NaBF,: 2.435¢ gfcm® (3% less than the x-ray
density of 2.50753¢) .

Both salts had been previously fused.

A density-temperature curve (Fig. 13.6) for MSBR
fuel salt was generated on the basis of the following
assumptions: (a) the pycnometrically determined
density (3.79 g/cm® at room temperature) would occur
in actual practice (i.e., in the MSBR fuel dump tank or
in freeze flanges); (b) the expansivity of the solid salt is
5 X 107%/°C, a crude estimate based on analogy with
other salts; (c) the density above the liquidus is reliably
predicted from additive molar volumes; ordinarily
densities of these melts, predicted this way, have
uncertainties of about £2%. . ,

Given the tenuous nature of assumption ¢ and the
uncertainties in b and ¢, the predicted 8% decrease in
density, upon melting, should be considered as a rough
estimate. A fact that should not be overlooked is that

Two curves depicting the density-temperature be-
havior of MSBR coolant (92-8 mole % NaBF; -NaF) are

given in Fig. 13.7. The solid lines refer to “theoretical”
(or x-ray) densities; the dashed lines refer to more
probable densities. At 243°C and at 385°C, the dashed
and solid lines coincide over much of the density

ranges. Three assumptions were used in drawing these

curves:

1. At 243°C (the solid transition temperature of
NaBF,) the partial density change, that is, that due
to NaBF, alone, is 17%7 or 15.6% for the density
change of the coolant salt composition (the portion
of the coolant that is NaF does not undergo an
expansion). | -

 

37, Cantor, this report, Sect. 12.3.

2. The expansivity of the solid is~5 X 1075 /°C [same
as assumption b above]. ‘

3. In practice, the density of the coolant would be 3%
less than the x-ray density as was observed pyc-
nometrically for pure NaBF,.

On the basis of these three assumptions and experi-
mental data for the liquid, a density decrease of 7.4%
on melting is possible; however, a density decrease of
about 4% is more likely. It should be noted that the
coolant undergoes a rather large density change in the
solid at 243°C; the predicted extent of this change is
based on the analogy between NaBF,; and NaClO, and
the validity of high-temperature x-ray diffraction data
of NaClO, .27 Thus a major uncertainty in predicting
the change of-density on melting is the uncertainty in

_predicting the change in density at the solid transition.

R G.Ross C.E.Bamberger C.F. Baes, Jr.

Previous studies! in this system of the reductive

quotient for the extraction reaction

to be independent of protactinium concentration when
up to 100 ppm protactinium was present. However, in
the protactinium isolation column described by
Whatley and McNeese,2 the concentrations of prot-
actinium, uranium, and thorium vary over wide ranges
in both the salt and bismuth phases. In particular the
concentration of protactinium reaches the 2000-ppm
level in both phases. It seemed desirable, therefore, to
carry out laboratory studies of the distribution behavior
and the phase stability of protactinium under con-
ditions simulating those of this proposed reductive
extraction ‘process. This has been the purpose of our
current reductive extraction studies.

"An experiment was designed, using previously de-

~ scribed procedures,! in which both protactinium and

uranium- extraction could be studied at the various
concentrations which would exist in the proposed

isolation column. In this experiment PaF, dissolved in a

carrier salt was to be added incrementally to a vessel
containing 250 g of fuel solvent (LiF-BeF,-ThF,,
72-16-12 mole %) and 250 g of bismuth with 2000 ppm
of dissolved thorium metal at 625°C. Protactinium
additions were to be continued until the protactinium
concentration in the bismuth phase as a result of
reaction (1) was ~2000 ppm. At this point UF; would
be added incrementally to effect the reaction

4UP(F) + 3Pa°(Bi) = 4U°(Bi) + 3Pa*(F), (2)

oxidizing the protactinium into the salt phase. Thorium

- metal would then be added incrementally and would

extract, by reaction (1), the protactinium into the
bismuth phase in the presence of uranium. An experi-
ment conducted in this manner would yield both
protactinium and uranium distribution data over a wide
range of concentrations of thorium, uranium, and
protactinium.

It was estimated that the first step (2000 ppm
protactinium in the bismuth) of the above experiment
could be completed by four 5-g additions of PaF,
carsier salt (20 g of LiF-BeF,-ThF,, 72-16-12 mole %,
containing 35,000 ppm 22!'Pa). However, after the
second addition the reductant material balance became
unsatisfactory, and we were able to obtain only one
reliable value for Dp,. The loss of reductant was
attributed to the presence of an oxidant, probably
OH", in the protactinium carrier salt. Although this
carrier salt had been extensively purified under the
same conditions as have been established for LiF-BeF,
melts, the equilibria for oxide-hydroxide removal from
a salt containing high protactinium and thorium con-

- centrations, such as this, presently are not well known.

Due to the unsatisfactory reductant material balance,
it was decided to change the course of the experiment.
All of the protactinium was oxidized into the salt phase
by hydrofluorination in situ. Incremental additions of
thorium metal allowed us to determine the equilibrium
quotient for protactinium extraction with the concen-
tration of protactinium in the bismuth reaching ~2000

-react with protactinium, Xrneeiy =1 X 107*, would

indicate that hydrofluorination in situ was effective in
removing the above-mentioned oxidant.

In view of the large uncertainty (20%) associated with
the neutron activation analyses, these wvalues are in
satisfactory agreement with OF2 = 1450 reported for
protactinium concentrations of <100 ppm at the same

apparent effect caused by protactinium concentration
up to 2000 ppm. |

Preparations have begun for an experiment as origi-
nally designed. With a more vigorous hydrofluorination
we expect to avoid the presence of OH™, which was
assumed to be the oxidant in the carrier salt used in our
 

 

 

 

 

first experiment. According to Mathews* we should be
able to confirm the absence of OH™ by monitoring the
HF evolution rate while sparging with hydrogen.

. 14.2 THE SEPARATION OF ZIRCONIUM FROM
URANIUM IN BISMUTH SOLUTIONS BY
PLATINIDE PRECIPITATION

D. M. Moulton  J. H. Shaffer W. R. Grimes

In the reductive extraction process for removing
uranium from molten=salt reactor fuels, the separation
of fission product zirconium from uranium will be
rather low. A good separation can be made by
fluorinating a side stream, but there is another possi-
bility now under investigation which will avoid fluorina-
tion and might reduce the uranium inventory in the
processing plant. _

It is known that zirconium and platinum form the
very strong intermetallic compound ZtPt;, with a heat
of formation of some —80 kcal.® The activity coeffi-
cient of zirconium in bismuth is not too low, so one
would expect the compound ZrPt; to be rather
insoluble. A rough calculation gives K, = X5, X3~
10717 at 700°. The strength of the compound UPt; is
not known but is probably less than that of ZtPt,,
while, on the other hand, uranium is more stable in
bismuth than zirconium. Therefore ZrPt; should be
formed more easily. '

If conditions can be found under which ZrPt; will
precipitate and UPt; will dissolve, then one can take a
salt stream containing these two and equilibrate it with
a Bi-Pt alloy. Proper control of the reduction potential
should let ZrPt; precipitate and UF; stay in the salt.
The bismuth would need to be hydrofluorinated from
time to time to strip it of zirconium.

We have begun a series of experiments to explore this
possibility. For the first, a special vessel was made, as
shown in Fig. 14.2. About 63 g Bi,0.25 g U,and 0.86 g

" Pt were put into the upper section, and the vessel was

heated to about 600° using the arrangement shown in A
so that the filter was cold and did not pass the liquid
metal. Next, 22.1 g of LiF-BeF,-ThF, (68-20-12 mole
%) with 62 mg of labeled ZrF, was introduced through
a filter stick which then served as a sparge tube. After 2
hr the tube was raised out of the liquid, and the whole
vessel was heated as in B. Finally the system was

The system was cooled and cut up for analysis. The
95Zr peak was counted on a Ge-Li diode and showed
40% of the Zr in the salt, less than 0.1% in the metal,
and 10% in the filter section, which was counted whole.
About 0.18 g of material was then shaken off the filter.

bismuth and salt (mostly Li; ThF;) with no evidence of
ZrPt;. This was confirmed by spectrochemical analysis
giving -about 20 wt % Bi and 8, 5, and 23 wt % LiF,
BeF,, and ThF,; (converting the reported metal values
to fluorides). Only 1.4 mg of platinum was in the

~ precipitate, while 0.38 g of platinum was in the metal
and practically none was in the salt. The uranium
behavior was similar to the zirconium: 26% in the salt,
10% in the precipitate, and 6% in the metal. In the
bismuth the lithium mole fraction was 0.0029 and that

of thorium was 0.0006, which are not as close together
_as previous experience would predict.

The conclusions to be drawn from this experiment are
clouded by the fact that not enough reductant metal
was added, as can be seen from the high concentration
in the salt of both uranium and zirconium. Although no
appreciable amount of ZrPt; was detected, some may
have formed in the filter pores and not have been
shaken loose. The fairly high concentration of both Pt
and U in the metal phase is encouraging; if these are in
equilibrium with solid UPt;, then K, for this is about
107"°. The measured K, for ZrPt3 & 1013 , which is
larger than expected, but there could be substantlal
errors if even a little of the ZrPt; was formed below the

indeed less stable than ZrPt;, and this has encouraged
us to look at the system further.

14.3 BISMUTH-MAGNESIUM MIXTURES
'AS RARE-EARTH EXTRACTANTS

D. M. Moulton J. H. Shaffer

The extraction of rare-earth fission products from
thorium-containing fuel salt mixtures into bismuth is
rather sharply limited by the precipitation of thorium
bismuthide. If the solubility of this material could be
increased, it would be possible to extract rare earths
with a smaller volume of liquid metal. One of our
objectives has been to look for additives to the bismuth
- which will have this effect.

Magnesium is a good solvent for thorium, and its
binary diagram with bismuth makes it look as though
the ternary system will contain more dissolved thorium
than bismuth alone. Magnesium is a strong reductant,
but there was a chance that its activity would be
reduced enough in bismuth to keep it from being
oxidized too much. A pot of 2.21 kg of LiF-BeF,-ThF,
(67-30-3 mole %) with a little CeF; and 3 kg of

bismuth, which had already been used in an extraction,
became available for the experiment. At 700° we added
first 20 g of MgF, and then 15, 30, 30, and 30 g of
magnesium metal. Some of the data are shown in Table
14.1.

After the second metal addition both the thorium and
the cerium began to disappear from the salt; by the
third they were just about gone. Most of the thorium:
was precipitated, presumably as the bismuthide ThBi,,
and something over half of the cerium was lost as well,
very likely as a coprecipitate. Almost all of the
magnesium went to the salt phase. Its mole fraction in
the metal did not exceed 0.02, which apparently was
not enough to increase the thorium solubility very
much (perhaps by a factor of 2 in the last sample). On
the basis of this experiment it looks as if magnesium
will not be a useful additive to bismuth for the primary
extraction step.

14.4 REDUCTIVE EXTRACTION OF RARE
EARTHS FROM MOLTEN LiF-BeF,-ThF,
(72-16-12 MOLE %) INTO TIN AND
ALUMINUM-TIN MIXTURES AT 600°C

J. H.Shaffer  D. M. Moulton

An experimental program has been initiated to
examine the application of tin as the primary metal
phase constituent for the reductive extraction of rare
earths from the MSBR fuel solvent. This program will
seek a comparative evaluation of pertinent distribution
coefficients and separation factors available in these
systems with those determined for the salt-bismuth
system. Some experimental findings with the salt-tin
and salt-tin-aluminum systems are presented.

The equipment and procedure used for these experi-
ments were very similar to those used in the investiga-
tion of the salt-bismuth system. The extraction vessel
was constructed from a 144n. length of 4-in. iron pipe
 

 

 

 

 

size stainless steel 304L pipe with welded end closures
of Y-in. steel plate. The vessel was equipped with a
graphite liner for primary containment of the two
liquid phases. An internal pipe of graphite provided
direct access to the metal phase for sampling purposes;
the stainless steel thermowell was also sheathed with
graphite. Each experiment contained 2.6 kg of tin and
2.5 to 3.0 kg of LiF-BeF;-ThF, (72-16-12 mole %)
with approximately 4.8 X 105 mole fraction of cerium
(~100 wt ppm) and 5 millicuries of '*%Ce gamma
activity. Samples of the two liquid phases were with-
drawn for analysis after incremental additions of
thorium and/or aluminum to the extraction systems.

The reported solubility of thorium in tin at 600°C is
<0.025 atom % (<489 wt ppm).® However, the results
of these experiments have yielded good material bal-
ances for thorium up to an indicated solubility of 2700
to 2900 ppm by weight. The behavior of cerium during
these experiments also corresponded very nearly to
solution behavior. In this respect, tin is comparable
with bismuth as the metal phase for the reductive
extraction process.

As in previous studies, the extraction of cerium from
the salt phase into molten tin was examined according
to the reaction '

4CeF; (salt) + 3Th®(Sn) = 4Ce®(Sn) + 3ThF, (salt).

The value of the equilibrium constant for this reaction,

K. = ( NCe )4 («NThF4)3 = /D
- Ce/~Th
¢ NCeF3 NTh °

was calculated to be 0.054 with limits by standard
deviation of 0.033 to 0.088. The separations of cerium
from thorium, D¢, /Dy, varied between 3.5 and 1.2.
Their relation to the thorium concentration ‘in the
metal phase according to the equation

 

o ol o 1,

is compared with that obtained in -the salt-bismuth
system in Fig. 14.3. On the basis of these data, the
salt-bismuth system is clearly more effective for rare-
earth extraction than the salt-tin system. | :
- Continued interest in tin for the reductive extraction

‘process is based on its use as a solvent for other metals.

These investigations will examine metal additives to tin
for possible lowering of the thermodynamic activity of
rare earths relative to that of thorium in the metal
phase. By a preliminary examination, aluminum was
found to be too strong as a reducing agent for the

- extraction process. In this experiment sufficient alumi-

num to yield a .5 wt % mixture in 2.6 kg of tin also
sufficed for reducing approximately a third of the
thorium and about a fourth of the cerium from the salt °
phase. The resultant salt mixture had a composition
corresponding to 4.7—5.5 mole % Al, 8.1 mole % Th,
68.8—67.9 mole % Li, and 18.4—18.5 mole % Be

Material balance calculations, based on beryllium for
the salt and tin for the metal, accounted for about 75%
of the aluminum, 90-95% of the thorium, and 84% of
the lithium in the system. Distribution coefficients and
separation factors calculated from these data are as
shown in Table 14.2. Except for the metal-phase
analysis of aluminum' in sample 5, the data are
reasonably consistent consndenng the magnitude of the
reduction.

Since aluminum had a ﬁmte distribution coefﬁcnent
in the extraction system, an additional experiment was
conducted at much lower aluminum concentrations.
‘Although the results of this experiment are incomplete,
the addition of 0.08 wt % aluminum to the tin phase of
an extraction system also resulted in the reduction.of

“thorium from the salt phase. Distribution coefficients

for cerium and its separability from thorium are not
readily distinguishable from those obtained for the pure
tin system.

14.5 EXTRACTION OF THORIUM FROM
PROCESSED MSBR FUEL SALT
INTO MOLTEN LEAD

D. M. Richardson  J. H. Shaffer |

Following the reductive extraction of uranium and

protactinium from single-fluid MSBR fuel salt into mol-

ten bismuth, further processing is required in order to
separate the rare earths from the bulk LiF-BeF,-ThF,
fluid. A method of separation that appeared feasible on
the basis -of earlier, unreported work consists in (1)
reduction of thorium into liquid lead leaving the rare
earths in the salt; (2) reduction of the rare earths into
liquid bismuth, leaving *“clean™ LiF-BeF,;and (3) back
extraction of thorium from liquid lead into LiF-BeF,
by hydrofluorination. A small pumped loop was con-
structed of stainless steel to test steps 1 and 3 of this
process in a dynamic, nonequilibrium system.”

At each end of the horizontal flowing lead loop are
vertical 4-in. iron pipe size vessels with graphite liners.
The vessels have top penetrations for sparge tubes,
electrodes, sampling devices, etc., and each has two
bottom pipes for recirculation of lead. The loop was
charged with 19 kg of hydrogen-fired lead, resulting in a
lead pool approximately 3 in. deep in each vessel. The
extraction vessel was charged with 2.6 kg of LiF-BeF,-
ThF, (65-23-12 mole %), containing labeled CeF;. The
recovery vessel was charged with 2.1 kg of LiF-BeF,
(66-34). The extraction vessel was hydrogen sparged
and electrolyzed by a central anode in the top of the
salt, with the lead pool and the graphite liner serving as
cathodes. The recovery vessel was sparged with H, -HF
to reoxidize dissolved metals from the lead.

- Initially various anodes were tested in.the extraction

vessel salt. A noble Pd-Ag anode was unacceptable -

because it was dissolved when contacted by splashes of
liquid lead. A molybdenum anode was oxidized and

 

"MSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Feb. 28, 1969,
ORNL-4396, p. 195.

dissolved in the fluoride salt. A graphite anode did not
pass essentially any current. In order to proceed with
the thorium extraction experiment itself, the problem
of finding a practical anode was bypassed by using a
sacrificial beryllium rod as anode.

An additional advantage in using the active metal
electrode, beryllium, was that on open circuit it served
as a reference potential against the extraction vessel and
apparently indicated the extent that the salt-cathode
interfaces were populated by reduced materials. Before
electrolyzmg, a beryllium potential more negative than
1 v was observed. After electrolyzing, the beryllium
potential was essentially zero. With prolonged sparging
below the lead-salt interface in both wvessels, the
beryllium potential returned to its original value.
However, if the extraction vessel liquid levels were
lowered or raised after electrolysis, the beryllium
potential would immediately become quite negative but
would return again to essentially zero potential as soon
as the levels were normalized. The effect of such level
changes was to expose fresh graphite liner surfaces to
the salt, and therefore a beryllium potential more like
that prior to electrolyzing was observed. Raising or
lowering only the beryllium electrode had no effect on
potential.

In all operation to date there has been an unex-
pectedly slow rate of removal of reduced metal from
the extraction vessel. Essentially zero removal was
detectable unless the gas sparging was below the
leadsalt interfaces. Either the reduced metal phases
were not easily dissolved in lead, or they were dispersed
in the salt so that they rarely contacted the lead. The
first possibility is supported by the relatively low
thorium solubility (504 ppm) in lead at 600°C.°®
The second possibility is suggested by the obser-
vation that when a graphite cathode was operated
in the extraction vessel it became wetted by the salt and

Supplement, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1969.
 

when removed from the vessel the salt adhering to the
electrode contained what appeared to be finely divided
metal particles. The solids remaining after dissolution of
this adherent material in Versenate—boric acid—citrate
solution contained only thorium and traces of iron.
Since current to the graphite cathode was easily
produced, it may be inferred that the graphite liner of
the extraction vessel was also an effective cathode, as
well as the lead pool, during the normal mode of
electrolysis and that dispersed, reduced metal remained
adherent to the graphite liner. The approximate relative
cathodic areas were: salt—graphite liner, 85%; salt—lead
pool, 15%. '

' The recirculating lead loop has been operated on an
intermittent basis, and a total pumping time of 162 hr
at approximately 625°C has been accumulated. Total
time with the lead loop melted exceeds 800 hr. The
total electrolyzer operation with a beryllium anode in
the extraction vessel is now 30 amp-hr.

The results obtained for transfer of thorium to the
recovery vessel are shown in Fig. 14.4 as a function of
electrolyzer ampere-hours. To -account for all of the
electrolyzer current it would be necessary to measure
all species reduced. It was assumed that 1.67 moles of
lithium was reduced for each mole of thorium, and the
line slope of the figure, for 2 kg of recovery salt,
represents 10% current efficiency. It is probable that
some of the unaccounted-for ampere-hours were due to
a current of lead ions that resulted from the splashing
of lead on the beryllium anode, since sparging below
the lead-salt interface was employed during electrolysis.

In addition to thorium, salt samples from the re-
covery vessel were also found to contain cerium,
displaying a clearly identifiable gamma peak for !**Ce
at 134 kv. Although precise interpretation of such peak
areas is difficult in the presence of thorium daughters,
almost the same fractions of cerium and thorium appear
to have transferred from the extraction vessel to the
recovery vessel. These data are shown in Table 14.3.

Although no separation of thorium from cerium by
reductive extraction into lead has been demonstrated
by the present experiment, this finding is not con-
clusive. The same result would be found if entrained
droplets of salt were actually being swept through by
the flowing lead. A more general problem raised by this

15.1 DETERMINATION OF OXIDE
IN MSRE FUEL

R.F.Apple J.M.Dale A.S.Meyer

Two samples of nonradioactive LiF-BeF, submitted
by E. L. Compere of the Reactor Chemistry Division
were analyzed for oxide. These samples were taken
from a larger quantity of salt which had been exposed
in the molten state to the atmosphere of a helium-filled
dry box for approximately 72 hr. The sample repre-
senting the surface salt contained 113 ppm oxide and
that representing the bulk salt contained 92 ppm oxide.

As was noted in the last report, the NaF trap in the
apparatus for determining the oxide content of radio-
active salt samples has degraded and restricts the gas
flow in the system. Preparations are now under way to
replace this trap. Because the trap is an integral part of
the directional gas flow control system which includes
the valves and heated valve plate, it is planned to
replace the system as a unit. This system is being
fabricated.

15.2 VOLTAMMETRIC DETERMINATION
OF U(IV)/U(III) RATIOS IN MSRE FUEL

J.M.Dale R.F.Apple

The equipment! for making voltammetric UQV)/
U(III) measurements in radioactive MSRE fuel samples
was installed in the hot cell. After repairing some leaks
which were found in the gas system, it was shown that a
molten sample could be maintained in the apparatus in

the reduced state. This was done by reducing a

radioactive sample with hydrogen and observing that
the half-wave potential of the U(IV) to U(III) reduction
wave was stable with time. ,

During this period it was concluded from equilibrium
considerations that knowledge of the U(III) concentra-
tion at 500°C is not sufficient to predict the U(III)
concentration at reactor temperature (650°C), due to
the buffering action at 500°C of the 70 + 10 ppm
chromium present in the MSRE fuel. Voltammetric
measurements on a radioactive fuel sample indicated
that the U(III) concentration did increase when the
sample was heated to 650°C and decreased when cooled
to 500°C. Meaningful U(III) concentration measure-
ments on fuel samples by any analytical technique
should, therefore, be made on samples at reactor
temperature. ‘ 7 .

Voltammetric measurements on an MSRE fuel sample
received and analyzed on May 8 indicated that about
0.4% of the uranium was present as U(III). At this time
enough zirconium had been dissolved in the fuel in the
reactor to reduce 1% of the uranium. It can be shown,
however, through equilibrium calculations that about
60% of the zirconium could have been used up in
reducing 6 ppm Fe(Il) if the starting concentration of
U(III) were about 0.08% and the activity of the reduced
iron had a value of 1. Another possibility for the

disagreement in stoichiometry between the zirconium

dissolved and the U(III) formed is discussed below.

An experimental setup in the Fluoride Research
Laboratory at the Y-12 site is being used to follow the
change in the U(IV)/U(III) ratio in a simulated MSRE
fuel as either the U(IV) is reduced or the U(III) is
reoxidized. The system contains 15 kg of LiF-BeF,-
ZrF4-UF, (64.4-30.2-5.20.27 mole %) and is main-
tained at 650°C under argon. Two methods are being
used to follow the change in the U(IV)/U(III) ratio: (1)
the voltammetric method using three platinum elec-
trodes and (2) a potentiometric method using a
reference electrode designed by C. F. Baes and B. F.
Hitch of the Reactor Chemistry Division. In the first
experiment the melt was reduced in steps by the

immersion of zirconium rods until the voltammetric
measurements indicated that 10% of the 1000 meq of
U(IV) present had been reduced to U(III). Results for
various -stages of reduction from both of the above
methods and those from spectrophotometric measure-
ments by J. P. Young are shown in Table 15.1. The
spegtrophotometric results of 1.5 and 3.5% may be high
due to an experimental problem which will be investi-
gated (cf. Sect. 13.6). |

At the 10% reduction level the loss in weight of the
several zirconium rods amounted to a total of 670 meq.
Even after allowing for the reduction of about 100 meq
of known impurities in the salt, 570 meq of zirconium
is left, which would correspond to a 57% reduction of
U(IV) to U(III). Two possibilities exist: either a large
amount of the zirconium metal goes into the salt as
coated particles and cannot dissolve, or the solution
used to clean the salt from the zirconium rods before
weighing is removing some of the zirconium. It has been

reported that the cleaning solution does not attack the

surface of unused zirconium rods.
After the reduction with zirconium the U(IV)/U(III)
ratios were followed as the fuel was reoxidized with

-NiF;. A total of about 156 meq of NiF, was required

to oxidize the U(III) back to 0.02%. The amount of
U(IIl) oxidized plus the 21 meq each of iron and
chromium totals to about 146 meq. This stoichiometric
agreement obtained from the oxidation of the fuel
confirms that all of the weight loss of the zirconium in
the reduction experiments was not available to the fuel
for a reduction process. ,

At the present time a piece of equipment is being
fabricated which will permit the reduction of the fuel

 with zirconium wire. It is planned that all of the wire

added to the fuel will be consumed and no second
weighings will be necessary. It is also planned to use a
working electrode sheathed with boron nitride for the
voltammetric measurements with the hope that better-
defined reduction waves will be obtained.

15.3 COMPUTER-OPERATED VOLTAMMETRIC
U(IV)/U(III) RATIO DETERMINATION

M.T.Kelley R.W. Stelzner
D. L. Manning

In one of the molten-alt cells utilized for the study
of U(IV)/U(III) ratios in molten LiF-BeF,-ZrF, by the
voltammetric method,? it was observed that the U(IV)/
U(IIT) ratio slowly increased with time. Starting with a
U(IV)/U(ID) ratio of ~10/1 (0.25 mole % total U), the
U(III) would essentially all be oxidized to U(IV) in
about two to three days. The U(III) could be regener-
ated with zirconium metal.

The cell assembly consists of a graphite cell that
contains the melt (~50 ml volume) which is then
enclosed in a quartz jacket to maintain a vacuum or
controlled atmosphere. The cap of the enclosure is held
in place with an O-ring seal, and the electrodes are
positioned by means of Cajon O-ring fittings. Although
the system appears tight, it seems feasible that traces of
impurities generated within the cell (SiF4 and possible
O-ring contaminants) could account for the disappear-
ance of the U(III). It is indicated from the data that the
rate of disappearance is first order with respect to
U(III), which would seem to indicate an impurity route.

"To study the problem further and also to gain
practical experience in adapting small on-line computers
to electroanalytical methods, a PDP-8 computer was
attached to the controlled-potential, controlled-current
cyclic voltammeter.

Two computer programs were written for the
U(IV)/U(IIT) ratio determination. One program is
written in machine language, the other in FOCAL
(FOrmula CALculator). Briefly, in the FOCAL program
the computer takes a data point for the current
measurement (actually the time derivative of the
current measurement) every 3 mv on the voltammo-
gram for a total of 100 points taken over the curve. For
each data point, however, an average of 128 samples per
Yo sec is taken. This step is designed to average out a
small 60-cycle ripple that is superimposed on the signal.
The computer next performs a 5-point smooth on the

‘data, locates the peak of the derivative curve, and from

this calculates and prints out the numerical value of the
U(IV)/U(III) ratio. The machine language program is
similar except that the computer takes a data point

every 1.5 mv on the voltammogram for a total of 256

points. Both programs yield results with a standard
deviation consistently less than 5%.

The procedure was made completely automatic with
the computer furnishing all command signals and
computing the U(IV)/U(Ill) ratio from the recorded
time derivative of the U(IV)/U(III) reduction wave. The
sequence of operation involves bringing the electrodes
from open circuit to a controlled-potential configura-
tion. After waiting about 30 sec, a series of five
voltammograms are recorded at approximately 1-min
intervals. The U(IV)/U(III) ratio from each voltammo-
gram is computed, and at the end of the five scans the
average value of the ratio and standard deviation for the
five runs are typed out. The cell is then placed at open
circuit, and after a waiting period of 15 min the
procedure is repeated. The results obtained so far
appear most promising for adapting small on-ine
computers to electroanalytical methods.

15.4 ELECTROANALYTICAL STUDIES

D.L.Manning H. W. Jenkins®

Emf studies on the Ni/Ni(II) couple in molten
fluorides® have indicated that the nickel system appears
to be a good choice for a reference electrode to be used
in molten fluoride salt systems. The NifNi(I[) couple
exhibits Nernstian reversibility, has only one valence
state, and is relatively noble, which are desirable
characteristics for a reference electrode.

A more quantitative measure of the reversibility of
the Ni/Ni(I[) couple was determined from Kinetic
measurements. From such experiments, it was hoped to
evaluate basic kinetic parameters such as exchange
current, transfer coefficient, and heterogeneous rate
constant for the reaction Ni?* + 2e = Ni®. The
definition of exchange current is

ip = anCgf("C% 5

where k is the heterogeneous rate constant, Cp,, and
Cy are the concentrations of the oxidized and reduced
forms of the couple, and a is the transfer coefficient.
Two methods were used for these experiments, the
relaxation voltage step method of Vielstich and

Christie, Lauer, and Osteryoung.”

In the voltage step method, after applying a small"
voltage step (few millivolts) to the system, the Faradaic

current, which is observed after the charging current has
become negligible, is extrapolated back to zero time.
The kinetic parameters are then calculated from the
measured zero-time current, the known voltage step,
and the known resistance of the system. For the
chronocoulometric method, a potential step is again
applied to the cell, following which the number of
coulombs passed, following application of the potential
step, is measured as a function of time. The coulombs
can be separated with diffusing and nondiffusing
coulombs, which permits the evaluation of kinetic
parameters k and . ,

A summary of the kinetic parameters for the
Ni/Ni(II) couple, believed to be reliable, is reported in
Table 15.2. It is believed that the agreement between
the two methods is good and that our values on the
kinetic parameters for the nickel system in molten
LiF-BeF,-ZrF, are of the correct order of magnitude.

~ The values for k and /7, are somewhat smaller than for

nickel in other media. This suggests that the charge
transfer for the Ni** + 2e¢ - Ni® reaction- may
correspond to a quasi-teversible process more so than a
truly reversible process in molten fluorides. The reason
is not known, although the greater complexing affinity
of fluoride melts forming more associated fluoro-
complex species may be, in part, responsible. From a
practical standpoint, however, as long as the exchange
current is large compared with the net current a
reference electrode is required to pass, it should remain
poised. For most electroanalytical applications in-
volving controlled potential, controlled current, and
potentiometric techniques, this is generally the case.

ION IN MOLTEN FLUORIDE SALTS
J.P.Young F.L.Whiting
- Gleb Mamantov

Evidence derived from spectral studies has shown that
the superoxide ion, 0,7, exists in several molten
fluoride solutions. The species has been observed in
molten LiF-NaF-KF, LiF-BeF,, and LiF-BeF,-ZrF, at
approximately 500°C and in molten KHF, ‘at 280°C.
This solute species can be added directly to the molten
solvent, in the case of the alkali fluoride eutectic, or can
be generated either by the addition of suitable oxidants
or by electrochemical oxidation. - o

The addition of sodium superoxide (NaO, ) to molten
LiF-NaF-KF yields a yellow solution. The spectrum of
this solution is shown in Fig. 15.1. The spectrum

consists of an absorption peak at 372 nm and a
shoulder -at - 260 nm which is on the side of an
absorption edge in the ultraviolet region. The 372-nm
peak agrees with the spectrum reported from O, in
liquid ammonia® and with the reflectance spectrum of
solid Na0O,.* The 260-nm shoulder has not been
previously reported. Besides direct addition, O, has
been prepared in this solvent by the oxidation of O(II),
perhaps as 0" or OH", with Mn(III), O,, or Co(III).
The species has also been observed spectrally after being
generated anodically from O(II) at a Pt or pyrolytic
graphite electrode.

The species is observed, at a much lower concentra-
tion level, after bubbling O, gas into either molten
LiF-BeF, or LiF-BeF,-ZtF, contained in a silica cell.
In this case it is assumed that O jon, if not already
present, would be furnished by reaction of the melt
with Si0,. It is not possible, yet, to establish absolute
concentration or solubility levels of O,” in various
fluoride melts as the sensitivity of the absorption peaks
is not known: It is assumed that the spectrum arises

from allowed transitions and as such is fairly sensitive .

(A,, = 10* to 10® liters mole™ cm™). The amount

observed to be generated in the BeF,-base solvents,
~ therefore, would be expected to be low (ppm level).

The fact that O, is observed raises the possibility of

- radiolytic generation of O,” from oxide ion in the

MSRE. In LiF-NaFXKF it was observed that although
the O,” ion was stable in a silica cell, it slowly
decomposed in a graphite windowless cell, possibly by

reaction with graphite to form CO or CO,. Thus if O,”

were present in the MSRE it probably would not be
stable in the presence of the reactor graphite. It should
be noted that the O®~ concentration of the reactor fuel
dropped from 100 to 50 ppm as the reactor went

: crmcal the concentration has remained at this low level

since. Is this oxide concentration stable because of
chemical purity or is it a steady-state concentration

- derived from several chemical and radiolytic processes?
In discussing this idea with G. E. Bdyd an alternate
radiolytic rdute for the removal of 0% also became

~ . apparent — that of direct oxidation of 0*" to O, by

atomic ‘fluorine, which should be in relatively high

- - concentration in the reactor core. It would seem that

the radiolytic behavior of the various oxidation states

- of oxygen in molten fluoride salts should be considered

'15.6 HOT CELL SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC
FACILITY

J.P. Young

The design and fabrication of the optical components
which are required for the hot-cell spectrophotometer
have been completed by the vendor, Cary Instruments
of Varian Associates. The completed unit, mounted on
a temporary stand, is shown in Fig. 15.2. The source
compartment and the monochromator-detector com-

160

partment are shown, respectively, in the front and rear
of the left side of the photograph. By the addition of
the necessary optical elements the light beam of the
spectrophotometer is directed through the 3-ftdong
wall embedment (the shiny metal section shown in the
center of the photograph) and into the hot cell. The
portion of the facility which is within the hot cell is the
darkened area at the right. Both sample and reference
beams pass into and out of the hot cell. The beams are
displaced vertically by 6 in. The moltensalt optics
furnace will be located in the upper sample beam. The
facility has been checked at the vendor’s site. Mechan-
ically the necessary components operate quite well.
Two identical sets of optics have been fabricated, and,

if necessary, those parts which must be replaced in the
hot cell can be replaced with manipulators. Optically
the facility should work quite well. On initial tests it
did not completely meet specifications, but it has
subsequently been realigned and is now en route to Oak
Ridge. After checking to see that the facility, which
weighs approximately 4 tons, was not damaged in
shipment, it will be installed within the wall of cell 7,
Building 3019, for final acceptance tests.

- The sampling procedure for transferring a sample of
MSRE fuel from reactor to optics furnace was previ-
ously discussed.!'® All components required for this

transfer have been fabricated. The optics furnace works

quite well. The top assembly, which is used in trans-
ferring the final sample from the sample loading furnace
to the optics furnace, works adequately. Minor faults in
the operation are being corrected. Both of these pieces
of equipment have been used routinely in the labora-
tory for spectral studies that have recently been carried
out. The operation of the sample loading furnace, both
thermally and mechanically, is not satisfactory. Further
design studies are presently under way to determine
what can be done to correct its operation. The
transport container, which is used to contain the MSRE
sample for transport from reactor to sample loading
furnace, has some sealing problems. These problems will
be corrected by altering the necessary seals. The
shielded heated sample carrier, which provides radiation
shielding and maintains the sample in the transport
container above 200°C for the transit from reactor to
hot cell, works quite well. To ‘improve handling
characteristics and decontamination methods, a cooling
coil will be installed in the carrier to cool the outside
skin temperature of the carrier to <50°C at the hot-cell
site. All components which will be within the hot cell
have been checked as to mechanical operatlon with
slave manipulators. These tests were performed in a

mockup which simulated hot-cell conditions. Problems -

found in these evaluations are being corrected.
In connection with spectral studies of molten fluoride

salts, there is a need for a melt container of fixed path -

length through which light can be transmitted. With

an excellent fixed-pathdength cell compatible with
many fluoride melts, but at present the small size of
available windows, 5 X 5 X 1 mm, and their possible
deterioration in high radiation fields precludes their use
with radioactive melts. Preliminary studies of a new
type of windowless and fixed-path-length cell have been
carried out. The cell makes use of “porous metal,” a
metal product developed by P. R. Mallory and
Company. Porous metal is a foil that contains a number
of small irregular pits formed by a proprietary electro-
chemical process; many of these pits are etched
completely through the foil, so that light can be
transmitted through the metal. Cells made with stainless
steel porous metal-will hold aqueous solutions quite
adequately for spectral study. P. R. Mallory and
Company has agreed to fabricate experimental batches
of porous metal made from Hastelloy N which has been
furnished to them by ORNL. If this product proves to
be satisfactory, it should be possible to fabricate a
fixed-path-length cell entirely of Hastelloy N, a material
which has been demonstrated to be compatible with

' radloactlve MSRE fuel.

~ R.F.Apple  A.S.Meyer

Because compatibility studies of the NaBF4 coolant
with structural material have indicated that there may
be some correlation between oxide and water contami-
nation and corrosion rates, we have undertaken a
program with the Metallurgy Division to study methods
for the purification of the coolant. Since BF; is used as
a blanket gas for the salt, an attempt. was made to
remove oxide as a hydrate of BF; by passing an He-BF;
gas mixture through the NaBF,. Upon titrating the
effluent gas with Karl Fischer reagent, it was found that
the NaBF, actually removed traces of moisture from
the BF;. Passing He-HF gas mixture through the salt at
950°F has shown that oxide can be removed from the
melt according to the reaction -

 2HF+ 0" =H,0+2F".

Tests are now under way to establish the optimum

- conditions for oxide remova] by the hydrofluorination

method.

 
 

'15.8 DETERMINATION OF BISMUTH
IN MSRP SALTS

A.M.Yoakum C. Feldman
: P, F. Thomason

In the previous reportl 3 it was indicated that several
approaches to the sensitive measurement of bismuth in
MSRP salts were under development. At that time the
only method sufficiently perfected for application to
salt samples (the potassium iodide spectrophotometric
method) was limited to samples containing approxi-
mately 10 ppm of bismuth or greater. Two additional

‘methods whose ultimate sensitivity is less than 1 ppm

have now been applied to MSRP salts. No attempts have
yet been made to adapt any of these methods to }ughly
radioactive salt samples.

.15.8.1 ~ Emission Spectrography

The sensitivity of the direct spectrographic determina-
tion of bismuth in breeder fuel is limited by interfer-
ence of the emission spectra of thorium and uranium.
The bismuth can be concentrated and quantitatively
separated from the major constituents by extraction
with dithizone (diphenylthiocarbazone) from acid solu-
tions. Only silver, mercury, tin, and a fraction of the
copper accompany the bismuth. None of these elements
are present in sufficient concentration to interfere with
the spectrographic measurement of the bismuth. The
following procedure has been applied to simulated
MSRP salts and actual samples from fuel reprocessing
studies.

- A sample weighing 10 g or less is fused with
NH,HSO, in order to eliminate the fluoride. The
excess NH; HSQ, is then evaporated off and the residue
dissolved in dilute HCl. The solution is adjusted to pH
1.5. The bismuth is now extracted from this solution by
shaking it with a solution of dithizone in CCls. The
organic phase is evaporated onto graphite powder and
the powder analyzed by the standard Li; COj-base
spectrochemical procedure. The absolute limit of detec-
tion is ~0.02 ug Bi. In a 10g sample, this corresponds
to a sensitivity limit of 0.002 ppm in the sample. Some
variation of this technique could obviously be adapted
to the determination of other trace constituents in fuel
samples.

The spectrographic method is obviously more com-
plex and time consuming than the polarographic ap-

proach described in the next section, but it is inherently
more selective. For example, it is not subject to
interference from traces of copper which may be
introduced dunng sampling of the salts. :

15 8.2 Inverse Polarography

- Inverse polarographic methods (polarographic strip-
ping techniques) provide enhanced waves for the
measurement of trace metallic constituents. The metal
is plated on an electrode for extended periods, and the
current reqmred for reoxidation at a relatively rapid
rate is then measured. For MSRP samples the technique
offers additional advantages in that major salt constit-
uents such as uranium and thorium are not deposited
and, therefore, do not contribute any interfering
strlppmg waves.

In the method now being applied to MSRP salts only
about 2 ml of sample solution (~20 mg of salt) is added

to the 10 m! of 1.5 M HCl electrolyte, and the
remainder of the sample can be used for other
determinations. The bismuth is deposited on a small
(~0.5 mm) drop of mercury whose dimensions are
defined by injection of a reproducible quantity of
mercury with a micrometer syringe through a polaro-
graphic capillary. Typical plating and stripping condi-
tions are a 3-min plating period at —0.8 v vs S.C.E.
followed by an anodic scan at 0.5 v/min. Calibration
waves for such measurements are shown in Fig. 15.3.
These conditions can be varied for specific samples
provided calibration curves are made under the same
conditions as the samples. At present, detection limits
are about 0.05 ppm. Tentatively, reproducibility is
about 20% for salts containing 1 ppm of bismuth.

The method is subject to interference from copper,
whose stripping wave is separated from that of bismuth

by only about 90 mv. Approximately a tenfold ratio of
copper to bismuth can be tolerated. No interference
from major salt -components and corrosion products
(Fe, Cr, and Ni) has been experienced. No studies have
yet been made on the effects of fission products and
other possible trace contaminants in the fuel. Many of
the earlier problems with the method have been traced
to impurities in the reagents. At present a specially
purified electrolyte prepared by isopiestic distillation of
HCl into triple-distilled water is being used.

In the analysis of samples of simulated MSRP fuel
from the Chemical Technology Division, concentrations
of bismuth from 0.1 to 6 ppm were determined.
Reasonable agreement with values measured by the
spectrophotometric method was observed at the upper
end of this concentration range.

Our materials program has concentrated on the
development of graphite and Hastelloy N with
improved resistance to irradiation damage. We have

approached the graphite problem by studying the -

dimensional changes during irradiation of several
commercial graphites. These studies have revealed
which graphites are most stable and, additionally, have
shown what preirradiation properties are important in
giving this stability. These findings are being utilized in
making some experimental graphites that likely will
have improved dimensional stability during irradiation.

The graphite used in an MSBR must also be sealed to

reduce the permeability to gaseous fission products. We

are developing techniques for sealing graphite with

carbon. :

The fast flux seen by the Hastelloy N is quite low,

and the irradiation damage to this material is associated
with the production of helium from the transmutation
of 1°B by thermal neutrons. The threshold boron level
required to cause embrittlement is too low to be

obtained commercially, so we sought to reduce the -

problem by changes in alloy chemistry. Modified
compositions of Hastelloy N containing additions of Ti,
Hf, and Nb look promising. The improved properties

H. E. McCoy

J. R. Weir

are associated with the formation of a fine dispersion of
type MC carbides, and we are studying how the carbide
type changes with alloy composition and aging,.

. The compatibility of Hastelloy N with fluoride salts

continues to receive attention; the main emphasis ‘is
currently placed on the proposed coolant salt, sodium
fluoroborate. This salt is more corrosive than other
fluoride salts; we attribute this aggressiveness to the
presence of absorbed moisture. The variation of corro-
sion rate with moisture content and methods of
removing moisture from a flowing salt stream are being
studied.

Some work has begun on deweloping structural
materials suitable for use in the chemical processing
plant. In this application the materials will be exposed

-to both salt and bismuth. Nickel-base alloys are highly

soluble in bismuth, and iron-base alloys mass transfer
very badly. Molybdenum seems compatible but is
difficult to fabricate. One avenue of research involves
methods of coating steels with molybdenum or tung-

- sten to protect them from the bismuth. A second area

of endeavor is that of finding brazing alloys that are

~ compatible with bismuth for joining molybdenum.

stringers were at temperature for 0.8 year and accumu-

lated fast and thenml fluences of 2.8 X 102! and 5.1 X
102° neutrons/cm? respectively.

The specimens appeared mechanically sound by visual
examinations, as shown in Fig. 16.1. As usual, the fuel

salt drained well, so that the surfaces of the specimens

were essentially free of salt. The graphite appeared

unaltered; however, the Hastelloy N was slightly darker -

gray than observed previously. This is true for those
with both short and long exposures; so the darkening is
related to some characteristic ‘of recent MSRE opera-
tion or to the current sampling operations.

The graphite samples removed previously had surface
films that could be seen in special lighting and also flow

patterns near protrusions on the surveillance assembly.?
The films were still visible on the samples just removed
that had been at temperature for 2.6 years (installed in
the MSRE on September 13, 1966). However, the flow
patterns were absent or modified by the conditions that
produced the darker gray appearance of the Hastelloy
N. The films on the graphite appeared to be approxi-
mately the same thickness as previously observed. To
date we have been unable to acquire enough of the film
material to make an identification. We could not find

- any films on the graphite from the other two stringers

that had been in the MSRE for a little less than a year.

MSRE. Heats NI-5065 and NI-5085, respectively, were
used to make the MSRE vessel heads and wall.> The

certified compositions of all three heats of Hastelloy N

appear to be a factor in the differences of their

missing from the intergranular regions that were
cracked or attacked. The intergranular separation is
atypical of fluoride corrosion of nickel-base alloys.

The 20-mil-thick straps of heat NI-5055 have low
ductility at room temperature. The microstructures of
both sides were essentially the same, although one side
contacted the graphite and the other fluoride salt. We
still would expect to see a carburization gradient even
across these thin straps for this exposure for ~2.6 years.

16.2 PROPERTIES OF THE HASTELLOY N
SURVEILLANCE SAMPLES

H.E.McCoy R.E.Gehlbach W.H.Cook

The fourth group of surveillance samples was removed
from the core of the MSRE in June 1969. Samples of
standard and modified Hastelloy N were removed, but
only the standard material has been tested to date. The
standard samples were placed in the core on September
13, 1966, when the reactor had been at temperature

The results of tensile tests on the standard alloy are
shown in Figs. 16.2 and 16.3. The.thermal control
samples have not been tested yet, so the irradiated
results are compared with those for unirradiated sam-
ples with no aging. The fracture strain of heat 5065
(Fig. 16.2) is generally decreased at all temperatures,
the reduction becoming much greater at higher tem-
peratures. The fracture strain is dependent upon the
strain rate above about 400°C being lower the lower
the strain rate. Heat 5085 (Fig. 16.3) has lower fracture
strains than heat 5065 up to 550°C and slightly higher
above 550°C.

The deterioration in the low-temperature fracture
strain is associated with heavy grain-boundary carbide
precipitation. Heat 5085 seems more susceptible to this
type of damage than heat 5065. This precipitation
occurs during aging in the absence of irradiation, but
the ductility reductions as a result of combined thermat

fracture strain at high temperatures is associated with
the formation of helium from the transmutation of
10B. The helium bubbles that result from this transmu-
tation are quite apparent in Fig. 16.4.

The accumulated results on the surveillance samples
give us an opportunity to observe the property changes
of Hastelloy N as a function of thermal fluence. The
fracture strain for heat 5085 is shown in Fig. 16.5asa

tested in this program. The steady decline in fracture
strain over the entire range of test temperature is

very dependent upon the strain rate.” The accumulated
results on heat 5085 at 650°C are shown in Fig. 16.6.
The strain rates of 300%/hr and 12%/hr were obtained
in standard tensile tests where the strain rate is
controlled. The minimum fracture strain for this
material occurs in a fast creep test where the creep rate
is about 0.1%/hr; tests at a slower strain rate have
slightly higher fracture strains. The MSRE vessel

17. Graphite Studies

17.1 PROCUREMENT OF NEW GRAPHITES
W. H. Cook

The rate of procurement of new grades of graphite
has slowed because we now have grades typical of most
of the known variations in the current graphite tech-
nology. Materials for future work will come from our
own fabrication studies and from new commercial
products.

One new material was received, an isotropic graphite
HL-18 from AIRCO Speer.!.It has a bulk density of
1.86 g/cm® and is currently being evaluated.

The superior neutron irradiation damage resistance
exhibited by Great Lakes Carbon Corporation? grade

' H337 and Poco Graphite Inc.? grades AXF and

AXF-5QBG (Sect. 17.6) warrants our making mor®
detailed studies on these types of graphite. We have
purchased modest quantities of Poco grades AXZ-5Q,

AXM-5Q, AXF-5Q, and AXF-5QBG for part of these
more detailed studies. These materials. are listed in
Table 17.1. The grades AXF-5Q and AXF-5QBG are
typical of the grades that have shown superior resist-
ance to irradiation damage. We shall expand our
evaluation of these both in--and out of neutron
irradiation. The grades AXZ-5Q and AXM-5Q have bulk
densities that are low for potential use in MSBR’s, but
they are fabricated from the same materials as the AXF
series. Studies of these lower-density grades may con-
tribute to our understanding of neutron irradiation
damage. Grade AXM-5Q is of special interest since it
was crushed to provide one of the principal reference
filler materials for the study of special binders.*

l‘l 2 GRAPHITE FABRICATION
R.L. Hamner

A development program was initiated to fabricate
high-density isotropic graphite bodies for molten-salt
reactor applications. The criteria for the properties of
the graphite bodies are based on data obtained on many
types of graphite bodies after irradiation testing in the
High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR). Our preliminary
plans are to fabricate bodies by extrusion, isostatic
molding, and warm (<1400°C) uniaxial molding. After
the necessary characterizations are made, specimens will
be selected for irradiation testing in the HFIR. -

We now have the necessary facilities for fabrication
by conventional techniques. We expect to develop new
techniques as the program progresses. Associated with
the development of new techniques is an autoclave,
now on order, which is rated at 20,000 psi and 1000°C.
We will use this autoclave to ‘determine the effects of
temperature and pressure on raw. materials as well as
preformed green graphite bodies. :

For the initial stages of our work, we have selected a

~ coal tar pitch and a prepolymerized furfuryl alcohol as

binders and four types of fillers: JOZ grade graphite
(Great Lakes Corporation), Robinson graphite (Carbon
Products Division, Union Carbide Corporation), Santa
Maria Coke (Collier Carbon and Chemical Corporation),
and Thermax (R. T. Vanderbilt Company, Inc.). These
materials are now being characterized.

 
 

17.3 X-RAY STUDIES
O. B. Cavin

We have shown previously that the degree of crystal-
line anisotropy strongly influences the dimensional

stability of polycrystalline nuclear graphite under neu- :

tron irradiation (£ > 50 kev).® As a continuing part of
the graphite evaluation program, we are determining the
x-ray anisotropy values for the grades of graphite being
irradiated in the HFIR facility. In addition to .the
previously described Schulz method for arriving at the
diffracted x-ray intensity distribution,® we have used a
sphere technique developed at this Laboratory? and
have shown that the results are in close agreement.

A spherical sample with a 0.2-in. diameter is ma-
chined on the end of a 0.25-in.-diam by 1l-in.long
sample, the axis of which corresponds to the direction
in which we desire the anisotropy parameter. This
sample, shown in Fig. 17.1, is mounted on a special
goniometer and rotated rapxdly about the stem axis
while simultaneously moving slowly through the angle
¢, the angle between the stem axis and the normals to
the diffracting planes. Rapid rotation about the stem
axis averages the diffracted intensity around the sphere
and approximates the integration through a § angle of
360°. With this technique data can be collected
through an angle ¢ of 90°, and no correction of the
diffracted intensity is necessary except for background
scatter. The data for intensity vs angle ¢ are then
analyzed in the same manner as is done in the Schulz
technique to arrive at an anisotropy parameter RS

‘The R values for several graphites are listed in Table
17.2. These results indicate that the two methods for
measuring anisotropy are comparable; the small vari-
ations are due to preferred orientation variations in the
material from one sample position to the next. How-
ever, the sphere technique is preferred because of the
short time (~36 min) needed to collect the data.

Our anisotropy values agree very closely with those
obtained at other installations on the same grades of
material. These accurate anisotropy values will serve as
a guide for the development of grapl-utes more resmtant
to rrradlatxon

17.4 ELECTRON MICROSCOPY OF GRAPHITE
' C. S Morgan C.S. Yust

The microstructures of polycrystallme graphite are
being studied by ‘transmission electron microscopy.
Several graphites have been examined in the as-
fabricated condition including AXF, CGB, ATIJ-S,
ATJSG, H-337," AXF-UFG, UK-ISO, and AGOT. The
microstructures generally consist of () regions having a
lamellar appearance, (b) cracks between and within

174

[oot8pum]

these regions, (c) voids, and occasionally (d) irregular
fiberlike configurations which may be partially graph- -

itized binder phase. The size and shape of the lamellar

area vary with graphite type. These regions are probably

sections through graphite filler particles. Selected area
diffraction patterns from large lamellar areas indicate

that such material contains a fiber texture consnstmg of '

rotations around the ¢ axis.
Diffraction contrast effects in the form of dark bands
lying ‘perpendicular to the lamellae are also observed.

The position and intensity of these bands vary as the

specimens are rotated on the microscope stage. This
contrast may be caused by small crystallites within the
lamellae or by bending of and/or cracking between
lamellae at their intersection with the polished surface.
An example of the contrast changes is shown in Fig.
17 2.

Carbon 1mpregnatlon of graphite ’oy gas pulsing
continues to look promising. The process seems
adaptable to graphites of widely different pore struc-
tures, For example, the two materials on which we have

respectively very narrow and wery wide pore spectra,

as Shown by Radiographing 0.5 mm Sections Exposed to

‘Different Mercury Intrusion Pressures (Equivalent Pore

Entrance Diameters). The light sections contained mercury and
were opaque to the x rays; the dark sections were not filled
with mercury at the partnculax pressure used and are transparent

- to X rays.

To evaluate the depth of carbon impregnation we
have continued development of the procedure described
earlier® which employs mercury porosimetry and radio-

- graphic techniques. Figure 17.3 shows six sections of

the same carbonimpregnated specimen which were
exposed to six different mercury pressures (six different
equivalent pore entrance diameters). The 350-psia
section shows at least some degree of carbon infiltration
‘completely through the wall of the specimen, since an

‘untreated section of the same type of graphite shows

while they have similar open-pore volumes. By opti--

mizing processing conditions for the individual pore

spectrum we have impregnated each of these graphites
with more than 7 wt % pyrolytic carbon.

We have applied the pulse impregnation treatment to
a third graphite of potential interest for MSBR use,
Great Lakes grade H337. This graphite has an unusually
high density, 1.99 g/em®, compared with 1.86 g/cm? for
AXF and ATJ-SG, and a concomitant small open-pore
volume. The impregnant carbon uptake was therefore

small (less than 1 wt %), but this did not interfere with’

achieving an effective seal in the H337.

complete mercury intrusion (opaque to x rays) at 350
psia. Proceeding clockwise around Fig. 17.3, the other
sections show pore size contours with only a very thin
layer at the outer edge having all pores less than 0.018
p. It is thus apparent that the very low helium
permeability of less than 10™® cm?/sec is associated
with only this outer thin layer.

We are also studying the gas pulsmg with con-
sideration of process scaleup. In all successfu! experi-
ments thus far we have employed induction heating to
generate the graphite temperatures necessary for im-
pregnation. We are now experimenting with a radiant
furnace which seems to reproduce the results of the
induction heaters. This furnace transfers heat from

tungsten-silica lamps to the graphite without directly
heating the glass process chamber, thus allowing the

175

graphite to run much hotter than the surrounding wall.

Having the graphite hotter than the wall seems to be a
requirement to prevent gas-phase nucleation. The radi-
ant furnace provides better temperature uniformity
than induction heaters and should be much less
expensive in large scale.

Analysis of the second set of gas-impregnated graphite
specimens irradiated in the HFIR has been confused by
the effects of ultrasonic cleaning used to decontaminate
the specimens after irradiation. Therefore we do not
have specific results on the effects of irradiation on the
carbon impregnant seal. We did, however, obtain some
indication from HFIR irradiation tests that the presence
of a large amount (up to 8 wt %) of carbon impregnant
in a graphite body may tend to accelerate volume
expansion during irradiation. Accordingly, this effect
will be considered in future tests. A third group of
gasimpregnated graphite specimens has been prepared
for irradiation in the HFIR. These specimens will
receive a fluence of about 1 X 10?2 neutrons/cm? (E >
50 kev).

17.6 GRAPHITE IRRADIATIONS IN HFIR
C. R. Kennedy

HFIR graphite experiments 7 and 8 have been
removed from the reactor, the specimens measured, and
a number of samples recycled in experiments 9 and 10.
The samples of H364 and Poco-AXF grades have
received exposure up to 3.8 X 1022 neutronsfcm? (50
kev). Several Pocograde specimens are in experiment 9
and will have accumulated 4.5 X 1022 neutrons/cm?
when the experiment is removed. |

The dimensional changes of the Poco-AXF and the
H364 grades continue to be nearly isotropic, and the
volumetric changes are given in Figs. 17.4 and 17.5.
Grades H364, H337, and H337M are laboratory and
two pilot-plant-processed materials, respectively, made
from the same coke, and appear to behave quite
similarly under irradiation. The volumetric changes are
-compared with the more conventional materials in Fig.
17.6.

materials; however, the Poco grades are not available in
the necessary sizes for an MSBE. Therefore R. Hamner
(ORNL) and S. Napier (Y-12) have reconstituted AXF
graphite in extruded bars to demonstrate the feasibility
of obtaining this graphite in the required sizes. This
reconstituted graphite has been irradiated for only one
cycle to 1.2 X 10%2 neutrons/cm?, and its irradiation
behavior is about the same as the standard AXF grades.
However, at least one more irradiation cycle is needed
to confirm the success of this material.

One of the most important areas of study in this
program is in understanding the density changes in
graphite due to irradiation. The bulk density changes
are shown by the volumetric changes in Fig. 17.6. These
changes relate both the actual density of the graphite
structure and the porosity. The porosity is considered
to consist of two types, the first being accessible to the
surface and the second being inaccessible. The two
types may be distinguished by the use of the calculated

- xTay crystal density and apparent density in a liquid,

A conservative estimate of the .u'seful life of H364 and -

the Poco grades is about 2.5 X 10?2 and greater than 3
X 1022 neutrons/cm? respectively. Although an evalua-
tion of these samples to give a more realistic lifetime
estimate is incomplete, optical surface observations of
the samples irradiated to 3.8 X 10?2 nvt and with as
much as 30% volume expansion did not reveal struc-
tural defects. All of these graphites are commercial

for example, mercury, kerosene, and helium. The
apparent volume displaced by the graphite, and the
density calculated therefrom, is dependent upon the
volume of the accessible pores. The difference between
the crystal density and the above measured density is
then proportional to the inaccessible porosity. We have
performed a number of the density measurements, and
the results are given in Fig. 17.7 as a function of
irradiation.

The interpretation of these results can only be
qualitative because of the two variables — accessibility
of pores and theoretical density. However, it does
appear that all of the graphites with a fairly wide
spectrum of unirradiated helium densities converge to
the same helium density with irradiation. The decrease
in helium density suggests that the crystal density has
decreased, as would be expected by the changes in
lattice parameters. The increase in helium density
shown by other specimens can only be a result of
increased pore accessibility due to irradiation. In fact,
the overall behavior suggests that the pore accessibility
of all the graphites becomes the same after an exposure
of around 1 X 10?2 neutrons/cm? and does not change
at higher fluences extending to the limits of the data
shown in Fig. 10.10, This is fairly direct evidence that

the large density changes seen in Fig. 17.8 are a result

predominantly of pore volume changes rather than
changes in the density of the graphite crystal structure.
Clearly, the increase in pore accessibility at high density
implies an increase in gas permeability. This effect, if
existent, cannot be determined on the present samples,
but awaits observations on very low-permeability ma-
terials.

17.7 THE ENERGY DEPENDENCE OF NEUTRON
DAMAGE IN GRAPHITE

M. T. Robinson

A dlsplacement cascade may be charactenzed by the
energy E of the primary recoil ion which generates the
cascade. The total number of displacements produced
in the cascade is then given by a function W(E) quite

aside from the ultimate fate of the displaced atoms.
However, due to inelastic scattering and electronic
‘excitation, the energy E is not all available to produce
the cascade; we may define a damage energy Ep, (<E)
which represents the correct parameter to insert into v
to take into account the energy losses over the cascade.

Mean damage energies E, have been calculated for a
number of materials, including graphite, taking into

17.8 FUNDAMENTAL STUDIES OF RADIATION
DAMAGE MECHANISMS IN GRAPHITE

D.K.Holmes  S.M.Ohr
W.E. Atkinson  T. S. Noggle

The fundamental study of radiation damage mech-

© anisms in graphite is a closely correlated effort between

experimental and theoretical work on the damage in
natural single crystals and pyrolytic graphite.

The theoretical work has focused primarily on a study
of kinetic equations, which describe the rates of change
of the concentrations of defects as they are produced
and interact. Such an approach depends heavily on
close correlation with experiment. While kinetic equa-
tions cannot yield final proof of the validity of a model,
they can establish the plausibility of a model and are
useful in suggesting new experiments, as well as in
interpretation of experimental results.

 

10M. w. Thompson and S. B. Wright, J. Nucl. Mater. 16, 146
(1965).

The main effort so far has been a study of the effect
of substitutional boron. Mayer has advanced the hy-
pothesis that migrating interstitial carbon atoms are
trapped by boron atoms and released only with a
moderately high activation energy. A new set of kinetic
equations has been developed covering the production
of interstitials and vacancies and the trapping, de-
trapping, annihilation, and clustering of interstitials.
These equations, ; despite technical difficulties with
methods of numerical integration, have been pro-
grammed and run successfully on the IBM 360 com-
puter. The results show clearly that trapping by boron
dominates interstitial migration, and thereby formation
of interstitial clusters, at surprisingly low boron concen-
trations. The concentration of clusters is shown to
depend on the square root of the boron concentration,

in. agreement with Mayer’s experiments. Both these

results are illustrated in Fig. 17.10. While the results

parallel Mayer’s calculations, they avoid his approxi-

~mations, which may not be valid with the high damage

rate obtained in the electron microscope. In our
calculations values used for several of the parameters
have been merely educated guesses, and further work

with these equations must await experimental results.

A second new set of kinetic equations has been
developed to study Kelly’s vacancy line hypothesis.
Kelly’s suggestion is that at very high dose sessile
vacancies may accidentally fall close together in a line,

- and relaxation across the line may lead to a partial or

complete healing of the layer plane except at the ends.
If the lines are immune to attack by interstitials, this

- would explain the increased damage rate at high dose;

this is also the only mode! put forth to date that can
explain the high rate of g-axis contraction. The equa-
tions include vacancy migration, with the idea that very
slow vacancy migration at moderate temperatures may
make it possible for a vacancy to jump once or twice to
a line, thus enhancing line growth. The equations are
slowly yielding to sophisticated techniques of numerical
analysis.

The experimental study of radiation damage is bemg
carried out by electron microscope observation of the
damage clusters formed in situ as a result of clustering
of carbon atoms that have been displaced from their
lattice sites by electrons in the illuminating beam of the
microscope. The experimental work to date has princi-
pally been concerned with establishing the experimental
conditions and techniques which will generate quantita-
tive information on the defect clusters observed.

The experimental observations of damage resulting

. from irradiations with an electron beam intensity of

10'® electrons/cm?® at temperatures of 350 to 550°C
indicate that there is an incubation period of 30 to 60
min before damage becomes visible in the microscope.

Trradiations are currently in progress to evaluate the

effect of irradiation temperature and beam intensity on
this incubation period as well as measurements on size
and density of the damage clusters as a function of the
experimental parameters. Application of electron dif-
fraction contrast theory to the defect clusters observed
has as yet failed to determine the nature of the clusters.

- It is supposed that they are interstitial clusters; how-

ever, they do not show the contrast behavior expected.
It is currently thought that due to small size and high

180

density, the contrast behavior observed results from the
interaction of the strain fields of neighboring clusters
which are at slightly different levels in the material.

~Stereoscopic studies have shown that the damage is

distributed more or ‘less uniformly throughout the
thickness of the specimen, and investigation is being
made of the possibility of using a stereoscopic method
to measure the dimensional changes parallel to the ¢
axis due to irradiation.

To date it has not been possible to employ the
experimental observations to test or suggest changes in
the theoretical treatment, due primarily to the un-
certainty as to the detailed nature of the clusters. It is
anticipated that the work in progress will delineate
experimental conditions that will lead to damage
structures amenable to detailed analysis, and the de-
velopment of the technique for measuring dimensional
changes will provide an additional experimental tool for
studying the damage in graphite.

17.9 MACROSCOPIC DAMAGE MODELS
'W.P. Eatherly
The construction of macroscopic damage' models

serves a useful function in defining possible mechanisms
by which properties change in irradiated graphite. They

obviously cannot be taken literally, since they are in

general both incomplete and nonunique. However, such
models have been extremely useful in the past as a
guide to experimental work and as some indication for
directions to proceed toward improved graphites.

The general concept of accommodation coeffi-
cients'! certainly: possesses validity. This concept as-
sumes the dimensional changes in bulk graphite can be

related to orientation factors plus an expansion of -

individual crystallites into adjacent voids. The eventual
tendency of all observed graphites to asymptotlcally
approach a growth depending quadratically on fluence
suggests that at some point accommodation is no longer
poss1ble and the bulk graphite expands in a “rigid”
sense.

We assume that the individual crystalhtes grow
exponentially as

where /, and I, are the crystallite dimensions in the 4
and c directions, respectively, g, and g, are constants

with g, <0, and @ is the fluence. In the bulk material

the observed growth will be a second-rank tensor which
can be related to an awerage over the individual

crystallites. That is, if we select a fixed coordinate
system in the bulk graphite and locate the ¢ axis of an
individual crystallite by Eulerian angles 8 and ¢, then a
rotation matrix l",-a(ﬁ, ¢) will transform the crystal
growth parameters g, and g, into components g;j in the
fixed coordinate system according to

&ij = ry gow[}? .
The I'" matrices satisfy the relationship

Although the last four equations have been written as
applying to an individual crystallite, in the absence of
accommodation we can assume they have been suitably
- averaged over the entire aggregate of crystallites. Thus
the I;; are simply related to the complete set of Bacon
anisotropy factors.

For the bulk material, we have

We note that for a single crystal g;; = 0 or 1 and all:
terms beyond the linear term in ¢ vanish. For poly-
crystalline materials the higher terms represent void
generation as the crystallites expand and work against
one another.!?> We note further that g, ~ — %g_; that
is, the individual crystallites undergo very little change
in volume during damage; hence the linear term in ®

For nearly isotropic materials, I;; ~ Y, and this term
almost vanishes. Hence the behavior is almost purely
quadratic. For materials that are anisotropic, there will

‘be an increasing departure from quadratic behavior as

the linear term becomes more important.
We conclude that a simple rigid expansion model with
void generation can reproduce at least grossly the

expansion behavior of bulk graphite at high fluences.

 

1214 is not immediately obvious that these terms represent

" void generation. It can be seen most simply in a purely

geometric model proposed independently by P. A. Thrower, in
which the graphite is represented as a collection of blocks and

- the generated voids can be drawn. For this special case the

above equatiohs reduce to Thrower’s model.

The creep behavior after aging 3000 hr at 650 and
760°C for four titanium-modified alloys has been
measured at 40,000 psi and 650°C. The rupture life and
ductility increase with titanium content when tested in
the as-solution-annealed condition. The ‘influence of
aging treatment on the creep properties is shown in
Figs. 18.1 and 18.2.

For the three lower titanium levels, aging at 760°C
reduces the rupture life and increases the creep rate.

and the rupture life of this heat is slightly increased for

each heat treatment plotted in Fig. 18.1.

The trends in creep elongation for . these same
treatments are shown in Fig. 18.2. For each heat
treatment the ductility increases with increasing tita-
nium content. Aging at 650°C significantly enhances
the ductility, whereas annealing at 1260°C and aging at

- 760°C gives the lowest creep ductility of the treatments

Aging at 650°C generally increases the rupture life..

Although the rate of creep deformation is increased
over that of the solution-annealed material, it is lower
than that found after 760°C aging. The most significant
point, however, is that the 1.2% titanium heat shows no
change in its creep rate as a result of the aging process,

18.2 STATISTICAL TREATMENT OF AGING
DATA FOR HASTELLOY N -

C.S. Lever C.E. Sesswns
We have previously discussed' the analys1s of variance

procedure for testing the tensile property changes upon

aging as a function of the variables in the aging

~ program. The analysis of variance (Table 18.1) was

calculated from the measurements made on 72 samples
after aging 1500, 3000, and 10,000 hr at 650 and
760°C. )

All of the main effects are slgmﬁcant except that the
time of aging greater than 1500 hr did not affect the
yield strength. Since many of the second-order inter-
actions are significant, the tensile response depends on

- at least two variables. For instance, we must define the
preage treatment to spe01fy the mfluence of tltanlum :

183

The third-order interactions were not significant in
most cases and thus could be used with the four
duplicate test results to estimate the error variation.
This variation was then used to establish a basis for
comparison of the main effect and second-order inter-
actions.

We used a regressxon model to fit the tensxle prop-
erties data as a function of aging time, temperature, and
titanium content for a given pretest annealmg COl’ldl—
tion. We used a model of the form

_ 2
E()=0o +B1x; +P11X1 2 +P151%,7 +B2X2 +P21%2
+ B33 + Byaxy Xy + Py3xy X3 +Pa3Xxax3 +By23X Xg X5,

where E(y) is the expected value (predicted value) and
Xy, X5, and x5 are the variables time, temperature, and
titanium content. By using a least-squares procedure we
minimized the residual sum of squares in this linear
regression model between E(y) and the observed data
for each tensile property. By considering other models
with various terms omitted, we obtained the best
equation to describe the experimental data with the
minimum variance. Fifteen equations were obtained,
describing the five tensile properties for the three
pretest heat treatments,

The main difference in the models that were selected
based on our fitting criteria is that the properties after a
1260°C solution anneal required the inclusion of a
cubic term (i.e., x,3) to fit the data, while this term
was not requlred to fit the 1177°C solution anneal data
or the 1177°C + 10% prestrain data.

Figure 18.3 is a plot of the fitted equatlons for yield
strength and total elongation at 650°C for samples
given a solution anneal of 1 hr at 1177°C. All data fora .

‘given preage treatment were used to determine the

coefficients in the regression equation, and thus the
curves plotted are defined by a least-squares fit of 24
points. The fit of the equation to the four ‘experimental
points for a given time of aging is better for the yield
strength than for the elongation. The equations plotted
are as follows:

general picture still holds. The fracture strains of several
of the more attractive alloys are shown in Fig. 18.4.

Our rather fragmentary results show that certain
alloys have good properties and that these alloys have
the MC-type carbide. Our results indicate that Ti, Nb,
and Hf: favor the formation of the desired carbide and
that silicon promotes the formation of the less desirable
M4C type. We have melted about 30 alloys that contain
various concentrations of these four elements. These
alloys are included in all phases of our work and should
enable us to select an optimum composition.

Our experience with alloys containing titanium and
niobium and the low costs of these elements make it
desirable that we utilize these elements in our alloy in
preference to hafnium (~$100 per pound) or yttrium
(~$300 per pound). We have demonstrated that alloys
containing up to 1.2% titanium and 2% niobium have
good weldability. Our postirradiation mechanical prop-
erty studies leave some doubt as to whether niobium
alone can produce the desired properties. Additions of
titanium alone can produce good properties, but the
exact level requned is not clear.

Because of the potential importance of the titanium-
modified alloys, let us look ‘briefly at the available data.
Several alloys that contain about 1% titanium have been
obtalned from various sources and ‘included in our
program. The compositions of these alloys are given in
Table 18.2, and the postirradiation creep results are
summarized in Table 18.3. These results are plotted in
Figs. 18.5—18.7 and compared with the properties of
irradiated standard Hastelloy N and unirradiated mod-
ified alloys. These results lead to several important

1. Alloy 21 behaves much like standard Hastelloy N.
This alloy was prepared by remelting standard
Hastelloy N, and most of the titanium likely ended
up as oxide. The high molybdenum and silicon
contents of this alloy should have resulted in the
formation of the MgC carbide, and the properties
would be expected to be equivalent to those of
standard Hastelloy N.

2. Alloys 75 and 76 have excellent properties under all
conditions tested.

~ 3. Alloy 107 has about the same composition as alloy

75, but the single sample of 107 tested has poor
properties.

4. Alloys 67-552,67-570, and 67-549 all contain about
0.9% titanium, and the carbon level varies from 0.01
to 0.08%. Tests on all three heats show poor
properties except a single test on heat 67-549 at
25,000 psi.

5. Alloys 67-551 and 67-548 contain 1.2% titanium
and have carbon levels of 0.028 and 0.102% respec-
tively. Again, only the specimens of the higher--
carbon heat tested at 25,000 psi have good prop-
erties.

Thus the apparent inconsistencies of these results
point to the complexity of the processes with which we
are dealing. All of these alloys have nominal composi-
tions of 1% titanium, but the properties are quite
different. Subtle changes in chemistry, differences in
melting practice, and small variations in fabrication may
all contribute to the observed property differences.

Our experience with commercial vendors has been
rather limited because of the lack of funds to purchase
large quantities of material. Since we began our
program, a new melting process has gained favor with
scveral vendors. This process, called the electro-slag
remelting (ESR) process, remelts an electrode under a

pool of molten slag. This slag protects the melt from '

the air but likely introduces another set of impurities
from the slag. In vacuum-melting practice this remelting
takes place under vacuum. The claimed advantages of
the ESR process are smoother ingot surfaces and some
improvements in physical properties and weldability.
We purchased two small (100 Ib) melts made by the
ESR process to examine their properties. The composi-
tions of the alloys are given in Table 18.4; one alloy

contained a nominal 0.5% titanium and the other alloy
did not contain any added titanium. The molybdenum
concentration was on the high side of our specification,
and the silicon content was from 0.4 to 0.5%. Two
micrographs of the two alloys are shown in Figs. 18.8
and 18.9. The composition was such that both alloys
contained stringers of MgC-type carbides, just as we
noted in standard Hastelloy N. Thus it is likely that
these alloys will not have good postirradiation prop-
erties; an experiment will be removed from the ORR in
October 1969 containing some of these alloys.

The ESR alloys were fabricated into Y% -in.-thick
plates and were about 6 in. wide by 12 in. long.
High-restraint welds were made by welding the indi-
vidual plates to a carbon steel strongback. Wire fabri-
cated from the same heat was used as filler metal, and
the material welded very well.

Several mechanical property tests have been run on
the ESR heats. The results of tensile tests are sum-
marized in Figs. 18,10 and 18.11. The tensile strengths
of both ESR heats are equal to each other and
equivalent to those of standard Hastelloy N. The

- vacuum-melted modified alloy generally has lower

tensile strength. However, the vacuum-melted modified
alloy has much better tensile ductility, especially at
room temperature. The ESR heats and the standard
alloy have comparable fracture strains at low tempera-
tures. At 650°C the ductility ranges from the highest of

47% for the vacuum-melted heat to the lowest of 32%
for the titanium-modified ESR heat. :

Stress-rupture tests at 650°C show that the ESR
alloys resist rupture at a given stress level about aslong
as the standard alloy, but not nearly as long as the
vacuum-melted titanium-modified alloy (Fig. 18.12).
Two tests on stress-relieved ESR welds show that the
rupture lives of the welds are equivalent to those of the
base metal. The creep rates from these tests show that
the ESR melts have better creep strength than standard
Hastelloy N but lower strength than the vacuum-melted
modified alloy (Fig. 18.13).

Thus the ESR alloys have acceptable properties in the
unirradiated condition, but the unavoidable presence of
high silicon (from the slag) likely will give a carbide
structure that is not conducive to good postirradiation
properties.

Two small melts were made by Allvac Metals Com-
pany having nominal compositions equivalent to two
ORNL alloys that had excellent postirradiation prop-
erties. One alloy had additions of 1% titanium and 1%
hafnium; a 50-lb heat was melted and fabricated
without problem. A seccond melt contained 0.5%
titanium -and 2% niobium and required frequent grind-
ing to remove cracks that developed during fabrication.
These alloys will be included in all phases of our
program.

18.4 ELECTRON MICROSCOPE STUDIES

R.E.Gehlbach  C.E. Sessions
S.W. Cook

We are continuing our stlidies of the role of the -
elements Ti, Nb, Hf, and Si on precipitation in modified

Hastelloy N. As previously reported,?’ additions of Ti,
Nb, and Hf cause the precipitation of MC carbides
rather than the M, C type that is found in the modified

alloy when the above elements are not present. Addi-

tions of silicon shift the type of carbides from M;C to

MgC and possibly from MC to M,C. The MC-type |
- carbides are finer than either the M;C or M¢C, and in
view of their morphologies and distribution we feel that

they are responsible for the superior postirradiation
properties of some modified alloys, partlcularly after
irradiation at temperatures above 700°C.

The MC carbides which precipitate in the tltamum-

modified versions of the alloy are not TiC but are based
on (Mo, Cr)C.? Figure 18.14 shows the concentrations

of metallic constituents (normalized to 100%) of the

MC as a function of titanium in the alloy. Some
titanium substitutes for a portion of the chromium as
the concentration of titanium in the alloys is increased.
The molybdenum content remains relatively constant.
The MC lattice parameter increases from about 4.21 to
4.29 A with titanium enrichment, and this is expected
since the atomic diameter of titanium (293 A) is
greater than that of chromium(2.57 A) which it replaces.

The morphologies of MC in the . titanium-modified
alloys are different for grain-boundary and matrix
precipitation. Carbides at the grain boundaries are
generally “pancake” shaped, approximately 1 g in
diameter and several tenths of a micron or-less in
thickness. The boundaries are quite rough because the
particles usually do not follow the | grain boundary

direction. In alloys contammg 0.5% titanium or more, a_

considerable amount of precipitation extends lor2u
“into the matrix. Matrix precipitation is generally
composed of very fine particles (<200 A) on thin films
which form at stacking faults as seen in Fig. 18.15.
Stacking faults are not observed when this matrix
precipitate does not form. =

The stacking fault preclpltatlon is nucleated at pn-
mary MC particles which are not put into solid solution

during - the initial  annealing. Dislocations produced

around these particles due to thermally induced stresses

provide sites for initial precipitation. The faults grow by -

a process of climb of the partial dislocation bounding

the sheet of precipitate. The diameter of these sheets is
often 6 to 8 u dependmg on the pnor history of the
specimen.

MC (HfC and TiC). (10,000X).

_The amount and extent of this type of precipitate is
sensitive to both annealing and aging temperatures.
Much greater amounts are formed on aging after

annealing at 1260°C rather than the usual 1177°C.

More primary particles are put into solution at the
higher temperature; thus more supersaturation exists
and enhances the stacking fault precipitation. Sub-
sequent aging temperatures also affect the extent and
amount of this precipitate, with higher temperatures
(760 rather than 650 C) glvmg more extenswe prec1p1~
tation.

The MC precipitation in an-atloy modified with 1%
titanjum and 1% hafnium is different from the alloys
modified with titanium only. The carbides formed are
HEC and TiC, the former in much greater quantities.
This would be expected since hafnium is a stronger MC
former than titanium. The carbides in the grain bound-
aries are quite thin and somewhat finer than in the
titanium-modified alloys. A more marked difference is
that very little stacking fault. preclpltanon is observed.
Most .matrix precipitates are in the form of platelets
with diameters of 0.5 u or less as shown in Fig. 18.16.

As previously reported,? titanium in concentrations
of >0.5%, or in combination with other strong MC-
forming elements, is necessary to stabilize MC rather
than M, C at 760°C. The modified alloys which contain
sufficient quantities of Ti, Hf, or Nb to give this
stability at 760°C exhibit very good:postirradiation

than 5% reduction in area when the test was dis-
continued after nearly 2200 hr at 27,000 psi.

We feel that superior postirradiation properties result
from favorable precipitate distributions which are
attainable with MC-type carbides. We are presently
irradiating alloys with several types of microstructures
to evaluate their resistance to high-temperature irradia-
tion damage. We can achieve stability of MC carbides by
adding 1% titanium, although 0.5% is not sufficient.
One percent hafnium, with or without titanium, is
sufficient to stabilize MC, even with 0,2% silicon in the
alloy. Since silicon promotes the formation of M, C and
M¢C, it is likely that considerably less hafnium would
be needed for alloys with lower silicon concentrations.
The role of niobium is not clear at this time, but at least
when used in combination with titanium it is effective
in stabilizing MC with very good irradiation resistance.

18.5 CORROSION STUDIES
J.W.Koger - A.P.Litman

Successful operation of molten-salt breeder reactors
(MSBR) requires understanding of the mass transfer
phenomena of structural materials while in contact by
the various fused fluoride salts. Mass transfer is influ-
enced by many factors including the impurity content
of the salt, the temperature and the temperature
difference, the container materials, and, under certain
conditions, the velocity. Therefore we have continued
studying mass transfer in a temperature gradient to
further evaluate the effects of these various factors.

Our work is currently centered around the com-
patibility of the Hastelloy N alloys (compositions given
in Table 18.5) with salts appropriate for single-fluid
breeder reactors, especially the coolant salt. Some tests
begun earlier with salts of interest for two-fluid systems -
have also been continued. Most of the work discussed
concerns natural circulation loops whose service param-
eters are detailed in Table 18.6. '

18.5.1 Fuel Salts

Loop 1255, constructed of standard Hastelloy N and
containing a simulated MSRE fuel salt plus 1 mole %
ThF,, continues to operate without dlfflculty after 7.4
years.

Loop 1258, constructed of type 304L stainless steel
and containing removable specimens in the hot leg, has
operated about 6.1 years with the same salt as is in
Loop 1255. A plot of the weight change of the
specimens in the hot leg at various temperatures is given
in Fig. 18.18 as a function of operating time. The
corrosion rate at the highest temperature, 688°C, based
on these weight changes and assuming uniform attack is
1.1 mils/year. Even though the weight losses are large,
the mass transfer has not been large enough to cause a
deterioration of the flow conditions.

Loop NCL-16, constructed of standard Hastelloy N

- with removable specimens in each leg, has operated

with the two-fluid MSBR fuel salt for over 13,500 hr. A
plot of the weight change of the specimens in the
hottest and coldest positions as a function of operating

“time is given in.Fig. 18.19. This figure is typical of the
_plots of total weight change of the specimens vs time

that we obtain from all the natural circulation loops. It
is clear that material is removed in the hot sections and
deposited in the cold sections. It is also obvious that
these changes are temperature dependent and that the
corrosion and deposition rates decrease with time.

The corrosion rate at the highest temperature, 704°C,
in NCL-16 based on these weight changes and assuming

- uniform attack is 0.04 mil/year, a very small amount of

attack. For this system, and all others studied to date,
titanium-modified Hastelloy N specimens continue to
have smaller weight changes than standard Hastelloy N

- specimens. Figure 18.20 shows the lmcrographs of a
titanium-modified specimen exposed at 704°C and a
. standard Hastelloy N specimen exposed at 676°C. The
. weight losses of these specimens are about the same and
. are given in Fig. 18.19. Figure 18.21 shows the changes
- in the concentration of chromium and iron in the

NCL-16 fuel salt as a function of operating time. The
chromium continues to show a steady increase with
time, while the iron content has stabilized. The attack

by high-purity fuel salt and other LiF-BeF, based salts
- is for the most part selective for chromium..

tion, which is a very low corrosion rate. The chromium
content of the salt increased from 25 to 66 ppm. The
bismuth content of the salt was <20 ppm for the last

presented previously.’) After shutdown the dumped
salt and the bismuth at the top of the finger were both
analyzed for certain metal impurities, and the results
are given in Table 18.7.

Table 18.7 shows that bismuth extracted impurities
from the salt in quantities proportional to the solubility
of these structural metals in bismuth. An analysis of
different portions of the bismuth (middle and lower
portions) is under way to enable us to determine a mass
balance. At present it is unclear, based on corrosion
rates of NCL-18 and -19, whether the removal of metal
impurities by the bismuth materially affected system

‘weight loss of a standard Hastelloy N specimen was 0.8

equivalent to 0.08 mil/year assuming uniform attack.
The chromium concentration in the salt in this loop has

increased from 21 to 90 ppm. Analysis of the dumped

salt from NCL-19 disclosed 225 ppm bismuth. We do
not know how much of the bismuth is in the salt by

virtue of the high-temperature excursion, but it illus- .

trates again that bismuth, in some form, can be carried

“into the salt.

The loop containing fertile-fissile salt and having the
bismuth appendage will be restarted because of its

‘extreme importance. This loop has been important
from several vantage points: (1) it stimulated the

development of better methods of analyzing salt for
low concentrations of bismuth, (2) it showed that
bismuth can move into a slowly moving salt steam,
likely due to the initial presence of impurities, (3) it
showed that metal impurities are extracted from the
salt stream by the bismuth, and (4) it demonstrated
over an operating period of 4700 hr that these processes

- did not cause an appreciable change in the corrosion

behavior. :

 
 

 

18.5.3 Blanket Salts

Loop NCL-15A, constructed of standard Hastelloy N
with removable specimens in each leg, has operated

9100 hr with the thorium-rich blanket salt. The

chromium concentration in the salt has increased from
25 to 145 ppm in 7000 hr, which indicates quite good
compatibility. Specimens exposed to this salt are often
‘glazed” with a material that is impossible to remove
without damaging the metal, and this has made weight
change measurements difficult.

18.5.4 Coolant Salts

Loops. — Loop NCL-13A, constructed of standard
Hastelloy N with removable specimens in each leg, has
operated for 7500 hr with the fluoroborate coolant salt.
Figure 18.22 gives the weight changes of specimens at
various temperatures as a function of operating time.
The corrosion rate at the maximum temperature,
605°C, is 0.6 milfyear. The attack in this case is
probably uniform, as the analysis of the salt shows
approximately 1000 ppm water and 1000 ppm oxygen.
Large amounts of these impurities are indicative of high
corrosion rates and nonselective attack by HF (pro-
duced by the reaction of water with fluoride salt). The
chromium concentration initially was 253 ppm and has
remained near that value throughout operation.

16,000 hr with the fluoroborate coolant salt. The
weight changes of the specimens at the various tempera-
tures as a function of operating time are given in Fig.
18.23. Two changes of corrosion rate are noted in the
plot. The first change, after 3500 hr, was due to a

- defective gas line, and the effects from this have been

discussed.® The second change, at some time between
11,000 and 13,000 hr, was due to a leaking standpipe

“ball valve. This last intake of impurities illustrates a

continuing problem of detection (other than the
obvious after-the-fact increase of impurities and corro-
sion rate), since the loop overpressure did not change
significantly. The apparent mechanism involves the
diffusion of moisture in the air into the relatively
moisture-free atmosphere of the loop (equalization of

~ partial pressure) without regard to the overall pressure
gradients involved. In this last corrosion rate increase
‘period the analyzed water and oxygen in the salt

increased from 1000 to 2300 ppm and 1300 to 4500
ppm respectively. The ball valve was repaired, and the
loop is continuing to operate.

Loop NCL-17, constructed of standard Hastelloy N

immediate and long-range corrosion of the system, any
local heating effects, and any large changes in pressure
due to steamn entering the system.

The loop was operated for 1000 hr and the specimens
removed and weighed. Steam was put into the flowing
salt system through a 16-mil hole in a closed %-in.
Hastelloy N tube. Five pieces of Y ¢-in. Hastelloy N
wire, to simulate heat exchanger tubes, were spaced
around the tube, one immediately in front of the hole,
Y5, in. from the tube. These will be studied to assess
any localized heating or corrosion. The only visible

effect of the steam injection was a rise of the bulk fluid
“temperature of 17°C for a very short period of time. .

After injecting steam for 20 min, an ove'rflowrof salt
was noted in a gas trap, temporarily disrupting flow. It
appeared’ that at this time the steam was no longer
soluble in salt and acted as a blanket gas. The steam
injection was stopped, flow was restored, a salt sample
was taken, and the specimens were replaced in the loop.

Future plans call for removal of specimens to assess the

effect of the steam on the corrosion process.

.An experiment has been completed to determine the
solubility and diffusion characteristics of chromium
from standard Hastelloy N alloy into relatively pure

NaBF4 NaF (92-8 mole %) containing approximately
400 ppm each of oxygen and water. Four capsules at
four different temperatures (427, 538, 649, and 760°C)
and containing large amounts of surface area of
standard Hastelloy N were exposed to the salt for 1200
hr. An Arrhenius-type plot of the results divulged a
linear relationship for chromium uptake vs temperature
between 427 and 760°C. The absolute values for

- chromium concentration are somewhat lower than data

from previous fluoroborate loop tests. These levels may
be associated with the impurity levels of the salts,
higher purity favoring lower chromium solubility.

With the realization that the fluoroborate salt is easily
contaminated with oxygen and water-type impurities

“and that corrosion increases with the amount of these

impurities, we have attempted, in close cooperation
with R. F. Apple and A. S. Meyer, to purify the
fluoroborate in a manner which could be adapted to a
large 'system. Our first attempt was the use of BF, gas
as the cleansing agent. It is known that both BF; and
NaBF, react with water, and it was hoped that the BF,
passed through the melt would remove the water from
the NaBF,4. Even though we were using BF3 in this
case, we were aware of problems that might occur with

 
 

 

another gas that removes BF; from the melt, thus
changing the composition and the melting point.
Therefore the experiment was conducted at ~427°C to
minimize the BF; vapor pressure over the melt. The
experiments have consisted in passing the gases through
a capsule of impure (3000 ppm H,0 and 3000 ppm
0,) NaBF,-NaF (92-8 mole %). The gas removed from
the capsule was dissolved in methyl alcohol with 10%
pyridine and titrated to the dead stop end point with
Karl Fischer reagent.. Results from these experiments
are being evaluated.

The second method gave more favorable results and
utilized a mixture of He and HF (purified with fluorine)
that was passed through the fluoroborate at 454°C.
Calculations are being made to determine the rate of
moisture removal. The HF flow was quite low and will

The standard meter has not previously been applied
to systems with temperatures over 150°C and has never

‘been applied to fused salts, Thus a large portion of our

initial work has been directed toward the solution of
materials problems unique to our proposed application.

We have used the corrosion meter successfully in the
following systems and are taking measurements of the

improve the - kinetics of the process. In the next
experiments BF3; will be added along with the other
gases to replace that being removed in the process.

18.5.5 Corrosion Meter’

Work has begun on the development of a corrosion
meter for rate measurements in high-temperature
molten salt media. The basic instrument being used at
the present time is the Petrolite corrosion rate meter,
model 103, made by the Petrolite Corporation,
Houston, Texas. The meter uses the linear polarization
technique and can be used for any metal or alloy in a
conducting medium which corrodes electrochemically
by a single metallic oxidation. Identical test, reference,
and auxiliary electrodes were successfully used because
only potential differences of approximately 10 mv are
measured. , . : ,,

In brief, an adjustable current source is used to
transmit a small electrical current between the test and
auxiliary electrodes. At the same time, a special
voltmeter measures the potential difference between
the test electrode and a reference electrode. The current
flow, by slightly polarizing the surface of the test
electrode, causes a shift in potential with respect to the
reference electrode, which is unpolarized and is cor-
roding freely. If the corrosion rate is low, a very small
current will polarize the surface of the test electrode. If
the corrosion rate is high, a large current is needed to
polarize the surface of the test electrode. With the use
of appropriate constants, the corrosion rate as given by
the current may be expressed in mils per year.

The next steps in the development of the corrosion
meter for molten-salt use will be 2 quantitative measure
of the interference effects due to the competing
reduction reactions in the system and possible inter-
ference of stray electric currents from the capsule to
the furnace. Through these experiments, it should be
possible to determine whether the corrosion of Hastel-
loy N in this medium is a simple oxidation of
chromium, limited by the element’s ability to interact
with the salt, or whether the corrosion proceeds by a
number of different mechanistic pathways involving
several metallic oxidations.

18.5.6 Corrosion Status

The time seems appropriate to orient the reader to
the current status of compatibility of MSR systems.

Table 18.8 compares recent standard Hastelloy N

corrosion data, reduced to mils per year equivalent
uniform attack, acquired from the first 4000 hr of
exposure to various fused fluorides.

It is clear from the table that with the exception of
the coolant-salt performance, the corrosion rates are
very low., Comparison of the rates experienced by
NCL-13A and MSR-FCL-1, both circulating the 92-8
mole % sodium fluoroborate, indicates a strong velocity
effect on mass transfer. It is our opinion that the effect
of velocity on corrosion in this system is of declining
importance as the purity level of the secondary coolant
salt improves. At some purity level, perhaps 200—400
ppm water and/or oxygen, solid-state diffusion of the
most active constituents in Hastelloy N, chromium and
iron, should control corrosion. Above this level the
attack becomes more r=neral, and the corrosion rate is
limited by the availability of hydrogen fluoride.

The MSRFCL-1 forced circulation loop is being
operated to evaluate the compatibility of standard
Hastelloy N with NaBF,-NaF (92-8 mole %) coolant
salt at temperatures and flow rates similar to those
-which exist in the MSRE coolant circuit. The test loop
operates with liquid velocities of 10 fps, maximum bulk
fluid temperature of 588°C, and minimum bulk ﬂuld
temperature of 510°C.

On February 29, 1969, a beanng fallure occurred in

" the LFB centrifugal pump after 2082 hr of operation at

design conditions.- The pump rotary element was
removed, and a new bearing was installed. To take
advantage of this unscheduled downtime, portions of
the loop piping and the corrosion specimens were
removed for metallographic examination and weight

change measurements. The loop was reassembled incor-
porating the same specimens and operated without-
‘incident for another 2000 hr, after which a scheduled
shutdown was made for the second removal and
examination of corrosion specimens. On July 30, 1969,
the test loop was again reassembled and started on a
third 2000-hr run. At the end of this report period the
test loop had accumulated a total of approximately
4800 hr at design conditions. Salt samples have been
~ taken about every 500 hr during the run.
- Figure 18.24 shows the weight changes for specimens
in MSR-FCL-1 as a function of salt exposure time. The
corrosion rate has decreased with time and now
averages 1.3 milsfyear for 4000 hr of operation, assuming
uniform attack. This relatively high rate is likely due to
the higher velocity in this system compared with
natural circulation loops. The initial exposure time of
2741 hr is divided as shown in Table 18.9. We feel that

exposure to isothermal salt should cause little corrosion
but yet realize that initial corrosion of a surface could
be large, especially since the salt is somewhat impure.
However, only salt exposure time at design conditions is
used in Fig. 18.24.

The chromium in the coolant salt mcreased from 66
to 300 ppm during the first 2082 hr of operation of this
pump loop. During shutdown the original salt was
diluted by an equivalent amount of salt when it was
dumped into the loop sump tank. Within the first 500
hr of the second run the chromium increased from 192
to approximately 240 ppm. The chromium level then
remained at about 240 ppm for the duration of the
second run. The iron content of the salt decreased from
407 to 252 ppm during the first 2000 hr and from 323
to 60 ppm during the last 2000 hr. These changes are
illustrative of the reaction

Cr® (dissolved in metal) + Fe** = Cr** + Fe® (deposited)

which occurs in molten fluoride systems that contain
me tallic impurities.

The results of the analyses for oxygen and water in
the salt have been quite scattered, with the values
around 1000 ppm for each.

Figures 18.25—18.27 show micrographs of specimens

from each specimen location in MSR-FCL-1 after
~4000 hr exposure. In Fig. 18.25 it is clear that the
attack at 599°C, the highest salt temperature, occurred
primarily at the intersection of the grain boundary and
the surface. At 555°C, as the weight changes indicated,
much less attack has occurred (Fig. 18.26). At 510°C,
the lowest salt temperature, a metallic deposit of the
approximate composition of Hastelloy N is visible along
the surface in the as-polished condition. This deposit
occurs under steady-state conditions and is unlike the
green deposit which is a mixture of fluorides and occurs
after saturation. .

18.7 STEAM CORROSION OF HASTELLOY N
B.McNabb H.E.McCoy

Hastelloy N was developed for use in a molten-salt
environment and has excellent corrosion resistance in
molten salt as well as good oxidation resistance in air.?

It would be desirable to use the same material of

construction in the secondary loop of a molten-salt
reactor, where it would be exposed to coolant salt and
steam. Information on the corrosion resistance of
Hastelloy N in a water-vapor or steam environment is
sparse and contradictory.®»1°

" To obtain the needed information, a facility was
designed and installed in TVA’s Bull Run Steam Plant
to evaluate the corrosion resistance of Hastelloy N and
modified Hastelloy N to supercritical steam at 3500 psi

“and 538°C (1000°F).

19.1 CHEMICAL-VAPOR-DEPOSITED COATINGS
J. 1. Federer '

Maés transfer of elements such as Fe, Cr, and Ni in
structural alloys limits the life of experimental bismuth-
salt extraction columns and associated components.

‘Although certain refractory metals and alloys are

resistant to liquid bismuth, fabrication of reprocessing
equipment using these materials is difficult. Therefore,
coating of refractory metals on relatively  easy-to-
fabricate .materials affords a potential solution to the
problem. | -

Tungsten, molybdenum, and other refractory metals
can be chemically vapor deposited by hydrogen reduc-
tion of the metal halides. However, these metals
generally have lower coefficients of thermal expansion
than the iron- and nickel-base structural materials.
Table 19.1 shows the average coefficients of thermal

expansion over the temperature range 25 to 600°C for

some of these materials. The difference in expansion
will cause the coatings to be in compression upon
cooling from the deposition temperature to 25°C or

A few experiments have been conducted to evaluate

tungsten coatings on carbon steel and type 304 stainless

steel. The coatings were applied by hydrogen reduction

" of WFg at 500 to 600°C. The steel substrates were

approximately 2-n.-ID pipes, both bare and coated
with approximately 0.001-n.thick nickel by elec-
trodeposition. One-mil-thick tungsten coatings were
adherent on cooling to room temperature after deposi-
tion except in a few small areas: Thermal cycling

One-mil-thick tungsten coatings on bare and nickel-
coated type 304 stainless steel tubes (approximately %
in. ID) spalled completely when thermal cycled be-
tween 25 and 600°C. Coatings between 0.005 and

these results two stainless steel electromagnetic pump

bismuth and stainless steel should be minimized, and
the lifetime of the pump duct may be substantlally
increased due to the presence of the coating.

Although molybdenum coatings have not.yet been
studied, results similar to those obtained for tungsten
are expected. Since nonadherent and cracked coatings
are not satisfactory for the protection of structural
materials, experiments are now being conducted - to
determine whether a metallurgical bond between the
- coating and base metal can be obtained by diffusion. In
addition, coating and thermal cycling tests are being
conducted with several iron-nickel alloys which have
coefficients of thermal expansion near those of tung-
sten and molybdenum.

Molybdenum or one of its alloys is a proposed
structural material for an MSBR processing plant. Since
brazing provides an attractive means.for fabricating

complex structures, a program has been undertaken to

~develop a brazing filler metal which is compatlble W1th
both fluoride salts and bismuth.! ;

Recrystalhzed materials generally are less ductile than

worked materials; therefore the temperature at which

~ brazing will occur is an important factor. Since the

recrystallization temperature depends upon both com- -

~position and fabrication history, we felt that some
prehmmary studies of the recrystalhzatxon behavior of

Rept. Feb. 28, 1969, ORNL-4396, p. 261.

Although cracking of the coating will |

several commercially obtained molybdenum alloys
using typical brazing cycles would be helpful. The
following materials were chosen for these studies:
unalloyed molybdenum, TZM (Mo—0.5% Ti—0.1% Zr),
and a special grade designated commercially as HT
molybdenum.? The metallographic appearance of the
TZM samples after heating to some typical brazing
temperatures is shown in Fig. 19.2. A brazing tempera-
ture of 1350°C for 10 min (typical time at temperature
for brazing small components) appears to be satisfac-
tory for TZM. Similar studies with unalloyed molyb-
denum indicate that the brazing temperature should not
be higher than 1050°C for 10 min. A special grade of
molybdenum known as HT molybdenum should have
had, according to the manufacturer, a recrystallization
temperature in excess of 1700°C and should have been
more ductile when recrystallized than regular molyb-
denum when recrystallized. However, our tests have
shown that it recrystallized after heating to 1525°C for
2 or 3 min. We did not have enough sample to
determine its ductility after recrystallization.

Based on these studies we feel that a brazing alloy
that flows at 1350°C or less will be required. Since
available corrosion data indicate that iron possesses
modest resistance to molten bismuth in the temperature
range of interest, brazing filler metals rich in iron
appear to provide the best chance for meeting the
combined requirements of flow temperature
(1050—-1350°C), compatibility, and metallurgical be-
havior. Consequently, we have melted several iron-base
alloys containing small amounts of boron, carbon, and
other elements as melting-point depressants. |

One iron-boron-carbon brazmg alloy was subjected to
static bismuth for 671 hr at 600°C. The sample size and

“the volume of bismuth were chosen so that corrosion

would not be limited by bismuth becoming saturated

" with iron. Metallographic cross sections of the exposed
‘and control samples are shown in Fig. 19.3. Bismuth

dissolved the ironwich portion of the fillet but did not
attack the molybdenum-rich reaction zone between the
brazing- filler metal and the molybdenum. The iron
content of the bismuth increased about 22 ppm, but no
changes in titanium or zirconium were detectable. Since
the remaining braze metal appeared structurally sound
and the TZM was unaffected by the exposure, we feel -

joints of this type have good potential for the contain-

ment of blsmuth

The automated remote orbital welding equipment
(discussed in Sect. 7.5 by P. P. Holz) has been moved to
the Welding Laboratory in Building 4508. All compo-

~nents of the system are currently undergoing a com-

plete checkout as to compatibility with the new control

- console which has just recently been completed by
ORNL Instrument Department personnel. Specimens

machined from 6-in. sched 80 pipe have been obtained
to simulate the Y-ring insert’ type of joint which we
have recommended for study. Y-ring inserts have been

‘ordered to continue these experiments. Preliminary

work with the orbital welding equipment has shown

- that good quality cover pass welds on austenitic

stainless steel pipe can be made. Therefore we shall
presently emphasize development of a procedure that
will give high-quality root passes. The use of Y-ring-type
joints has shown a much improved root pass over
conventional joint designs. Other experimental welds
are being made to determine the effect of pulsing the

() Part-6. Molten-Salt Processing and Preparation

M. E. Whatley

Part 6 deals with the development of processes for the
isolation of protactinium and the remowval of fission
products from molten=salt reactors. The chemical basis
for the flowsheets presently being considered is now
firm, and engineering development is under way.
Protactinium is to be isolated by a reductive extraction

“scheme which traps it in an extraction cascade between

thorium (less rioble) and uranium (more noble). The
rare earths are to be removed by a reductive extraction
operation on a salt stream from which the uranium and
protactinium have already been removed. -

The study of the distribution of the rare earths during
reductive extraction was extended to consider the
effect of temperature and the effect of varying the free
fluoride equivalence of the salt. While definite trends
were established, they are probably not large enough to
be useful. A flowsheet analysis of the rare-earth removal
system employing rare-earth—thorium separation fac-
tors that range from about 1.2 for europium to about 3
for neodymium show the process to be workable if the
engineering development of process components is

- successful. However, the- need for a large electrolytic
cell, at least three times as large as the electrolytic cell
used in the protactinium isolation system, that will

operate at a low salt flow rate with the salt phase

- almost totally depleted in thorium makes the develop-
ment difficult. Among the alternatives being explored is
the separation of thorium from the rare earths by the
selective precipitation of thorium bismuthide from the
bismuth extract phase. This separation is not complete
and may not be useful.

The transuranium elements, with the exception of
curium, were found to fall between uranium and
protactinium under the reduction extraction conditions
of the protactinium isolation flowsheet. Curium, except
for its trivalent behavior, distributes much like protac-

tinium. Plutonium, which possibly .could be used in an
initial fuel loading for an MSBR, exhibits a separation
factor from protactinium of about 10. Analysis has
shown that equipment designed to operate with a
U-Pa-Th system would serve acceptably with a Pu-Pa-Th
system. We have made an iterative calculation of the
protactinium isolation system to simulate " transient
behavior and have found that the system is stable,
assuming a straightforward control system and reason-
able random error in a control element.

Our engineering efforts have focused on the develop-
ment of extraction equipment and electrolytic cells.
The flowthrough facility, designed to pass 15 liters of
bismuth countercurrent to as much as 15 liters of salt in
a small continuous contactor, is undergoing its shake-
down operation. A variety of problems, most of which
sttem from the use of carbon steel as a material of
construction, were encountered; however, we are en-

couraged that the system will function to yield the

required data on extraction tower performance.

Work with electrolytic cells was concerned primarily
. with the establishment of a usable protecting layer of

frozen salt on the exposed surfaces of the container for
the molten bismuth anode. During this reporting period

our successes were limited, but we have been developing -

operational techniques which promise ultimate success.
Distillation as a practicable operation for use in
processes for molten-salt reactors was demonstrated by

‘processing 11 liters of MSRE carrier salt during 31 hr of

remote operation of an experimental still at the MSRE.

~Although distillation is not now one of the principal
operations in our reference flowsheet, it has several

peripheral applications, and its successful demonstra-
tion broadens the scope of possibilities for manipulating
salt systems. : :

- in the reductive extraction process: obviously is of

interest. Distribution coefficients for plutonium, using
two different LiF-BeF,-ThF, melts at 600°C, were
presented in the previous semiannual report.> These
data showed that plutonium was less easily extracted
than uranium (U-Pu separation factor of about 10) but
was more easily extracted than protactinium. Plu-
tonium probably could be separated from protactinium

tors are each about 3. As seen in Fig. 21.2 plutonium,
americium, and californium are nearly inseparable,
whereas the plutonium-curium separation factor is
about 10. These results indicate that curium would
probably coextract with protactinium in the process
and suggest that curium could be used as a stand-in for
protactinium in reductive extraction experiments.

21.2 EXTRACTION OF RARE EARTHS AND
THORIUM FROM SINGLE-FLUID MSBR FUELS

L.M.Ferris  F.J.Smith
J.C.Mailen J.F.Land

Distribution coefficients for thorium and several rare

‘earths, measured with LiF-BeF,-ThF, (72-16-12 mole

%) at 600°C, were reported previously.? Additional
measurements - during this reporting period include
those for promethium and europium.

Data for promethium were obtained as follows:
About 0.5 mg of **7Pm was irradiated to produce 1 mc
of the 5.4-day '*®Pm. The promethium isotopes were
then dissolved in 100 g of LiF-BeF,-ThF, (72-16-12
mole %) by a 24-hr treatment at 600°C with HF-H,
(50-50 mole %) in the presence of 200 g of bismuth.
The bismuth phase was saturated with thorium at
600°C, and after equilibrium had been attained, four
pairs of filtered samples of the salt and bismuth phases
were taken. The 1.46-MeV gamma peak from the
5.4-day '*®Pm was used for promethium assay of each
phase. The average promethium distribution coefficient
from the four pairs of samples was 0.025 * 0.003,
yielding a promethium-thorium separation factor of 1.7
+0.3. , L o
The distribution coefficients obtained for europium
at 600°C using LiF-BeF,-ThF, (72-16-12 mole %) can
be ‘expressed as log D, = 2 log Dy ; + 3.74. These
results, along with those obtained for thorium, showed
that the europium-thorium separation factor was about
1.1 at 600°C when the bismuth phase was saturated
with thorium. At thorium saturation of the bismuth
phase, the separation factor decreased from about 1.6
to about 0.9 as the temperature was increased from 525
to 750°C. : - '

The effect of temperature on the lanthanum-thorium
and samarium-thorium separation factors was deter-
mined in separate experiments with LiF-BeF,-ThF,
(72-16-12 mole %). In each experiment, about four
pairs of samples were taken at each of several tempera-
tures between 525 and 750°C; the bismuth phase was
saturated with thorium in each case. Average values for
the respective distribution coefficients and separation
factors are given in Table 21.2. The samarium-thorium
separation factor was about 2 regardless of the tempera-
ture, whereas the lanthanum-thorium separation factor
decreased from about 2 to 1.5 as the temperature was
increased from 525 to 750°C. Despite the scatter in the
data, these results (and those for europium given above)
clearly show that temperature has no marked effect on
the rare-earth—thorium separation factors.

Methods for enhancing the rare-earth—thorium sepa-
ration are constantly being sought. Distillation has been
considered as a means for increasing the “free fluoride”
equivalence* of the salt that would be fed to the
rare-earth removal part of the reductive extraction
process. As shown in earlier studies'>*™* the rare-earth—
thorium separation factors increase with increasing
“free fluoride” equivalence of the salt. Distillation
would be used primarily to remove BeF; (along with

some LiF) from the salt, since the relative volatility of .

BeF, is much higher® than that of ThF,. Relatively
low-melting salts having “free fluoride” equivalences of
at least +25 could probably be produced -in the
distillation of LiF-BeF,-ThF4 (72-16-12 mole %),
which has a “free fluoride” equivalence of only +4. The
extractability of samarium and thorium from such a
salt, LiF-BeF, -ThF, (80.5-6.1-13.4 mole %), which has-
a “free fluoride” equivalence of +28, was determined at
700°C. The distribution coefficients obtained in this

experiment are shown in Fig. 21.3. The slope of the line
representing the plot of log Dy; vs tog Dg.. is 3,

whereas that for the plot of log Dg ' vs log DTh is 3.

These results show that the samarium species in the salt

phase was primarily trivalent. When the bismuth phase

was saturated with thorium (Dpy, ~ 0.035), the
samarium distribution coefficient was “about 0. 14,
corresponding. to a separation’ factor of 4. This separa-
tion factor is only about twice as high as that obtained’

at 700°C with LiF-BeF; -ThF, (72-16-12 mole %).

21.3 COPRECIPITATION OF RARE EARTHS
WITH THORIUM BISMUTHIDE
F.J:Smith  C.T. Thompson

A possible means of increasing the overall rare-earth—
thorium separation factor in the reductive extraction

 
 

 

process would involve the selective precipitation of
thorium from the thorium—bismuth—rare-earth solu-
tion generated in the rare-earth removal step. In this
connection, precipitation of thorium bismuthide from
solutions containing rare-earth metals is being studied.
Partitioning of the rare earth between the liquid and

~solid phases has been observed in each experiment

conducted to date.

In the experiments, rare-earth metal was added to
bismuth at 700°C to produce a solution containing
either 1000 to 1300 ppm of lanthanum or 200 ppm of
europium. Analyses of filtered samples confirmed the
rare-earth concentration. After the rare earth had
dissolved, enough crystal-bar thorium was added to
ensure saturation of the bismuth at or below 600°C,
but not at 700°C. The system was then slow cooled
stepwise to several temperatures between 600 and
350°C and was held at least 24 hr at each temperature
before a filtered sample of the liquid phase was
removed for analysis. At the end of the experiment the
temperature was raised to 700°C, and a sample was
taken. Analyses of these final samples showed that no
thorium or rare e¢arth was consumed by irreversible side
reactions during the experiments.

The results from one of the experiments (LA-2) are

shown in Fig. 21.4. As seen, lanthanum coprecipitated
with thorium bismuthide at each temperature below
600°C. The thorium concentrations obtained at temper-
atures of 600°C and below are in excellent agreement
with the solubility values obtained previously.” On the
other hand, the lanthanum concentrations were well
below the reported solubility values.®® The data
obtained in each experiment can be représented by the

. logarithmic distribution relationship

log (REo/REg) = Alog (Tho/Thy) ,

described by Doerner and Hoskins.'® In this equation,
RE, and The denote the initial concentrations of rare
earth and thonurp, respectively, and REf and Thy
denote the concentrations in solution at each tempera-
ture. The plots of log (REo/REy) vs log (Tho/Thy) were

lanthanum and europium respectively. Apparently euro-
pium does not coprecipitate to the extent that lan-
thanum does. Although coprecipitation occurs, there is
some separation of the rare earths from thorium. The
data obtained with lanthanum' indicate that a lan-
thanum-thorium separation factor of about .25 would
be obtained if the bismuth phase from the rare-earth
removal.system were cooled slowly to 350°C. Since the
lanthanum-thorium separation factor is about 2 in the
reductive extraction step, the overall rare-earth—
thorium separation factor would be about 50. A careful
engineering evaluation will be required to determine
whether addition of a crystallization step to the
rare-earth removal system will be practical.

As postulated by Doerner and Hoskins,'® a loga-
rithmic distribution of the solute (rare earth) would be
expected if each crystal layer of thorium bismuthide, as
it forms, were in equilibrium with the solution at the
time. The equation is normally utilized with data
obtained in aqueous systems at a constant temperature,
and A is usually slightly temperature dependent. In the
 

 

 

 

 

experiments described above, A appeared to be inde-
pendent of temperature. It is interesting to note that
similar results were obtained by Moriarty, Johnson, and
Feder!'! in their studies of the coprecipitation of trace
me tals with CeCd,; ; from liquid cadmium.

21.4 DISSOLVABILITY AND SOLUBILITY
OF PuF; IN LiF-BeF, (66-34 MOLE %)

J.C. Mailen F.J.Smith

If present schedules are met, the first of several small
additions of plutonjum to the MSRE fuel salt will be
made in Séptember 1969. It has been proposed that the
MSRE be refueled later using LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %)
as the carrier salt and plutonium as the primary
fissionable isotope. Ultimately, thorium fluoride might
be added to make the salt 1 to 2 mole % in ThF,.
Plutonium will be added to the MSRE fuel salt as PuF;
powder (see Chap. 25), a technique that could probably
‘be employed when the reactor is refueled. Laboratory-
scale tests were conducted to show that powdered PuF;
is readily soluble in LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %) at 600°C
and to confirm earlier measurements of the solubnhty of
PuF; in this salt.

The PuF; used in these tests was prepared at Los
Alamos Scientific Laboratory and was designated a 5-u
powder. The as-poured bulk density of the powder was
determined to be about 1.4 g/cc. The experiment was

initiated by adding 1.48 g of PuF; through a long-

stemmed funnel to 100 g of unstirred molten LiF-BeF,
(66-34 mole %) at 600°C. Filtered samples of the liquid
were then taken at short intervals. Analyses of these
samples showed that half of the PuF; dissolved in
about 10 min and that complete dissolution was
achieved in about 1 hr. The final solution contained
‘about 0.165 mole % PuF;. These data predict rapid
dissolution of PuF, in the MSRE pump bowl, where
good mixing can be achieved.

Following the dissolution test, more PuF; was added
to the system, and the solubility of PuF; was deter-
mined at several temperatures. The data obtairied
(Table 21.3) are in excellent agreement with the earlier
measurements of Barton.!'? The values reported in
Table 21.3 are based on alpha-pulse-height analyses for
239Ppy. It is interesting to note, however, that the same
values were obtained by gamma-spectroscopic analysis
of the **'Am decay product when the count rate
obtained with the samples taken at the end of the
dissolution test was used as the reference point. The
PuF; concentration in these samples (0.165 mole %)
was well below the solubility limit.

After the solubility measurements were completed
sufficient ThF; was added to the salt to make it 2 mole
% in ThF,. The solubility of PuF; in the resulting
solution was then determined over the temperature
range of 500 to 650°C. Analyses of the samples for
plutonium have not yet been completed; however,
gamma-spectroscopic analyses for 24! Am showed that
the solubility of PuF; was not markedly affected by
the presence of 2 mole % ThF,.

22. Flowsheet Analysis

M. W. Whatley

The process flowsheet envisioned for a single-fluid
MSBR has been described previously.! Calculations
have been continued on several aspects of the flow-
sheet. These include the protactinium isolation system,
the rare-earth removal system, the stripping of thorium
from salt entering the electrolytic cell in the rare-earth
removal system, and the fission product concentrations
and heat generation rates in a processing plant. Results
of these calculations are summarized in the following
sections. - - '

22.1 ISOLATION OF PROTACTINIUM
L.E. McNegse

System performance for the proposed flowsheet for
isolating protactinium from a single-fluid MSBR (Fig.
22.1) has been recalculated using current 'data on
reduction potentials and thorium solubility. Calcula-
tions were made for an MSBR fueled with uranium, as
well -as for initial operation of an MSBR fueled with
plutonium. According to the flowsheet, fuel salt from
the reactor enters the bottom of the extraction column
and flows countercurrently to a stream of bismuth
containing reduced metals. Ideally, the metal stream
entering the top of the column contains sufficient
thorium and lithium to extract only the uranium and
plutonium entering the system, The system exploits the
fact that protactinium is less noble than uranium but
more noble than thorium. Both uranium and plutonium
are preferentially extracted in the lower part of the
column, while protactinium refluxes in the center. High
protactinium concentrations are produced in the salt
and metal streams. Most of the protactiniim in the
system can be isolated by diverting the salt stream
through a tank of sufficient size (about 200 ft).

Calculations have been made for both steady-state
and transient system performance. The following values

were assumed for the calculations: fuel salt composi-
tion, 71.7-16-12-0.3 -mole % LiF-BeF,;-ThF;-UF,;
reactor volume, 1461 ft3; processing rate, 2.5 gpm
(three-day cycle); operating temperature, 600°C;
reactor power, 1000 Mw (electrical); and protactinium
decay tank volume, 200 ft?. The thorium and lithium
concentrations in the bismuth stream being fed to the
column were 0.0016 and 1.4 X 10 mole fraction
respectively. In the calculations for an MSBR fueled
with plutonium, the salt.composition was assumed to
be 71.8-16-12-0.2 mole % LiF-BeF;-ThF4PuF; ; other
values were the same as those given above.

- 22.1.1 Steady-State Performance for the
Case of MSBR Fueled with Uranium

Calculated concentration profiles in the extraction
column are shown in Fig. 22.2. The uranium concen-
tration in the salt increases from the inlet value of
0.003 mole fraction to approximately 0.004 mole

fraction in the first stage because of the reduction of
U(QV) to U(II). It then decreases steadily to negligible

values at the salt outlet, The concentration of protac-
tinium in the salt increases from the inlet value of 1.39
X 1075 mole fraction to a maximum of 0.0021 mole
fraction, then decreases to negligible values near the salt
outlet. The concentration of thorium in the bismuth
stream decreases from about 0.00132 mole fraction in
the upper part of the column to 7.9 X 107® mole
fraction near the bismuth outlet. The concentration of

Aithium in the bismuth decreases from about 0.00124

mole fraction in the upper part of the column to about
0.00011 mole fraction at the bottom of the column.
The concentrations of uranium ‘and protactinium in

- the salt entering the decay tank are 1.25 X 1075 and

1325 X 1073 mole fraction respectively. The concen-
trations of uranium and protactinium in the decay tank
are 2.63 X 107° and 1.312 X 10~ mole fraction
respectively. Under ideal steady-state operating con-
ditions, approximately 93% of the protactinium present
in the reactor system would be held in the decay tank.
However, it is likely that the actual amount of

-protactinium isolated from the reactor will be some-

what below this value because of an inability to
maintain optimum operating conditions.

The variation of the calculated steady-state protac-
tinium concentration in the reactor and in the decay
tank with bismuth flow rate is shown in Fig. 22.3. The
bismuth flow rate is a typical operational variable;
changes in the concentration of reductant in the
bismuth phase or the salt flow rate would produce
similar effects. The minimum protactinium concen-
tration in the reactor is obtained when the bismuth
flow rate is just sufficient to extract the uranium
entering the system. At slightly higher bismuth flow
rates, protactinium will also be extracted, since it is the
next component in order of decreasing nobility. At
bismuth flow rates slightly lower than the optimum rate
(about 5.3 gpm), some of the uranium will not be
extracted; instead, it will displace protactinium from
the decay tank, forcing the latter to flow out the top of
the column. In either case, some protactinium would be
allowed to return to the reactor, and the effectiveness
of the system would be diminished.

The flowsheet has several very desirable character-
istics, including: (1) a negligible holdup of fissile 233U
in the isolation system, (2) an almost immediate return
of newly produced 223U to the reactor system, and (3)
a closed system that precludes loss of protactinium,
233y, or other components of the fuel salt. Since the
performance of the system is sensitive to variations in
operating conditions, attention has been given to
methods for controlling the system and for making the
performance less dependent on operating conditions.
Removal of uranium from the center of the column
makes the system less sensitive to minor changes in
operating conditions (see Fig. 22.4). For example,
removal of 2% of the uranium in the salt entering the
decay tank results in stabilization of the system with
respect to bismuth flow variations (below the optimum
flow rate) as large as 1.03% of the optimum. The
uranium concentration in the salt, which is very
sensitive to small changes in operating conditions near

- optimum conditions, increases by a factor of 5000 for a
" decrease in bismuth flow rate of only 0.037%.

22.1.2' Transient Performance for the Case
.of MSER Fueled with Uranium

Calculations were also made to show the transient
behavior of the protactinium isolation system. Since the
uranium concentration in the salt entering the decay
tank had been shown to be very sensitive to operating
conditions when these conditions were near optimum,
measurement of this concentration was chosen as the

means of controlling the system (see Fig. 22.5). It was
assumed that the uranium concentration in the salt
entering the decay tank could be measured by fluorinat-
ing approximately 5% of the stream. The measured
uranium concentration  would ' then be used by a
controller having proportional, integral; and derivative
actions to control the bismuth flow rate through the
columns. A random error distributed normally about
the controller output and having a specified standard
deviation (usually 5%) was considered to be imposed on
the control system. The system was assumed to operate
for a specified time interval (0.06 day) at each bismuth
flow rate selected by the control system. During this
period the extraction columns were assumed to operate
at steady state; however, the reactor and decay tank
were treated as perfectly mixed vessels having inlet
concentrations equal to the column effluent concen-
trations. o | '

plutonium concentration in the salt decreases steadily
from the inlet value of 0.002 mole fraction to negligible
values at the salt outlet. The concentration of protac-
tinium in the salt increases from the inlet value of 2.5 X
1075 mole fraction to a maximum of 1.244 X 1073
mole fraction, then decreases to negligible values. The
concentration of thorium in the bismuth stream drops
from 1.26 X 10~ mole fraction in the upper part of
the column to 5.6 X 10™® mole fraction at the bismuth
outlet. The concentration of lithium in the bismuth
decreases from about 1.23 X 10~ mole fraction in the
upper part of the column to about 3.2 X 10™* mole
fraction at the column exit.

The concentrations of plutonium and protactinium in
the salt entering the decay tank are 2.22 X 10™* and
1.244 X 1072 mole fraction respectively. The concen-
tration of protactinium in the decay tank is 1.231 X
1073 mole fraction. Under ideal steady-state operating
conditions, approximately 87% of the protactinium
present in the reactor system would be held in the

decay tank. The variation of protactinium. concen-

tration in the reactor and in the decay tank with
bismuth flow rate is shown in Fig. 22.8. The results
indicate that isolation of protactinium in a reactor
fueled with plutonium would be feasible.

It should be noted that the nuimber of stages in the
column was chosen on the basis of a reactor fueled with
uranium and that use of more stages would result in
improved plutonium-protactinium separation and hence
lower plutonium concentrations in the protactinium
decay tank. The additional stages would not present
operating difficulties when the plutonium was replaced
by uranium during operation of the reactor.

222 REMOVAL OF RARE EARTHS FROM
A SINGLE-FLUID MSBR

~ L.E.McNeese C.P.Tung

The proposed method for removing rare earths from a

single-fluid reactor by reductive extraction has been

described previously.? Calculated performance results
were given for 2 1000 Mw (electrical) reactor having a
volume of 1461 ft® and .a salt processing rate (for
rare-earth . removal) of 0.25 gpm (30-day cycle). The

extraction columns contained a total of 12 or 24

theoretical stages, and the feed point was located at the
center of the column, which represents a near-optimum
condition for a rare-earth—thorium separation factor of

- 2.0. The separation factors for several important rare

 

- 2MSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Feb. 28, 1969, ORNL-

225

earths have been found to be less than 2.0, and recent
results indicate that the separation factor for europium
may be lower than was believed earlier, perhaps as low

-as 1.1. Since the optimum :feed point location is

dependent on separation factor, additional attention
has been given to this relationship in order that
improved operation might be obtained. Calculations
showing the effect of feed point location for total
numbers of stages of 18, 24, and 30 have been made.
For a separation factor of 1.1, the optimum feed
location is within 1 to ‘2 stages of the top -of the
combined extraction columns; with this location, re-
moval times of 960, 750, and 630 days may be
obtained. It should be noted (Fig. 22.9) that the
removal time for materials with separation factors of
1.5 or higher is increased by locating the feed point
near the top of the combined columns. The number of
stages above and below the feed point will finally be set
by considering the removal times desired for materials
having low separation factors (e.g., europium) as well as
the removal times desired for materials having separa-
tion factors of 1.5 to 2.0. |

Results for a system having 20 stages below the feed
point indicate that the removal times for materials
having separation factors of 1.1 to 1.3 are essentially
unaffected by the addition of stages above the feed
point. However, for materials having separation factors
greater than 1.5, the removal time decreases with the
addition of stages above the feed point.

The effect of salt feed rate was determined for a
bismuth flow rate of 15 gpm and a system having 5§
stages above the feed point and 19 stages below the
feed point. The removal time for materials with
separation factors of 1.3 or lower increased negligibly as
the salt feed rate was increased. A decrease in removal
time was noted for materials having separation factors
greater than 1.5; the extent of decrease became greater
~ as the separatlon factor increased.

22.3 STRIPPING OF ThF, F ROM MOLTEN
SALT BY REDUCTIVE EXTRACTION

'j L.E.McNeese C.P. Tung

Efficient operation of the reductive extraction system
for rare-earth removal requires® that only a negligible
quantity of ThF; remain in the salt which passes
through the electrolytic cell and returns to the bottom
of the extraction column. It has been proposed that this
low ThF,; concentration be maintained by stripping the

226

ThF, from salt that is fed to the cell by countercurrent -

contact with a lithium-bismuth stream produced at the
cell cathode. We have made calculations that show the
extent to which ThF4 can be removed from the salt
with a column containing one to four theoretical stages.
It was assumed that the salt entering the stripping
column had the composition 72-16-12 mole % LiF-
BeF, ThF, and that the metal entering the column
consisted of a lithium-bismuth mixture having a lithium
concentration of 0.008 -mole fraction, The metal-to-salt
molar flow rate ratio, based on the feed streams, was
74.6.

The fraction of the ThF4 remaining in the salt stream
that left the column is shown in Fig. 22.10 as a
function of the number of theoretical stages used. With
one theoretical stage, the fraction of ThF, remaining in
- the salt stream is approximately 0.12; for two stages,
0.013; for three stages, 0.96 X 10%; and for four
stages, 2.16 X 10”7, Since the required fractional ThF4
removal is about 0.99, two to three theoretical stages
will be sufficient to maintain the desired fractionat
removal of ThF,.

Figure 22.11 gives pertinent data for the reductive
extraction processing plant. The calculations were made
for a 2250 Mw (thermal) reactor operating with 1461
ft® of LiFBeF,-ThF,-UF, fuel salt. Noble metals and
rare gases were assumed to be removed on a 50-sec
cycle, halogens and rare earths on a 50-day cycle,
zirconium and seminoble metals on a 200-day cycle,
and alkaline earths and alkali metals on a 3000-day
cycle. With these assumptions the decay heat generation
rate in the fuel salt as it leaves the reactor would be
about 56 kw/ft®; a 15-min holdup in the feed tank
would decrease this rate by a factor of about 3.3. If it
were not for the concentration of 232Pa and fission

228

that in the reactor, resulting in a heat generation rate of
28.7 kw/ft>. There are large concentrations of fission
products at two other points also: the zirconium
removal system and the rare-earth accumulation system.
In the former, the decay heat generation rate can reach
55.8 kw per cubic foot of salt for the equilibrium
condition of 49 mole % fission product zirconium
present in LiF-Z1F, . In the rare-earth accumulators, the
rate increases to 12.9 kw per cubic foot of salt when
the rare-earth concentration is increased to 0.0069 mole
%.

The equilibrium fission product composition of the

‘fuel salt as it leaves a 2250 Mw (thermal) MSBR for

products at certain points in the process, the heat

generation rate in the salt would continue to decrease as
the salt proceeded through the process. However, the
trapping of 233Pa at the center of the extraction
column incréases its concentration to about 92 times

processing is given in Table 22.1. The low concentration

“of certain elements, for example, the noble metals and

rare gases, is based on the assumption that extremely
effective plating out and stripping mechanisms for
removing these nuclides are at work in the reactor.

23. Engineering DeVelopment of Process Operations

L. E. McNeese

Engineering development related to processing of
single-fluid MSBR’s is being carried out in several areas.
These include operation of a reductive extraction
system in which up to 15 liters each of molten salt and
bismuth can be countercurrently contacted in an
0.82-in.-ID packed column, development of electrolytic
cells, development of salt-metal contactors, and meas-
urement of axial mixing in packed and open columns.
Results of these studxes are given in the remainder of
this section.

23.1 REDUCTIVE EXTRACTION ENGINEERING
STUDIES

H. D. Cochran, Jr. B. A. Hannaford
L. E. McNeese

_In spite of difficulties encountered in handling molten
salt and bismuth in a carbon steel system, three runs

have been made in which salt and bismuth were

‘contacted in the packed column described in earlier
~ reports.! Problems involving the control of the flow
rates of the two phases in these runs have been
eliminated by modifying the system. '

During March about 200 kg of bismuth was charged
to the graphite crucible in the treatment vessel. The

molten bismuth was sparged with hydrogen at 650 °C to
~ reduce oxides, and about 300 g of thorium metal was
added to convert any remaining oxides to ThO,.

Hydrogen was also passed through the equipment at
600°C in order to reduce any iron oxide that was
‘present in the system. The thorium-bismuth solution
was then transferred through the system to reduce any
- remaining iron oxide, but it appeared that virtually all
of the iron oxide had been reduced during the hydrogen
treatment. About 53 kg of LiF-BeF;-ThF, (72-16-12
mole %) was charged to the treatment vessel and was

sparged W1th 30% HF in hydrogen for 30 hr at 600°C to

4396, p. 291, _

229

remove oxide impurities. The salt was then sparged with
hydrogen in order to remove dissolved HF. '

In the first run, flow control problems were severe. As
bismuth flow (50 ml/min) was begun, salt was forced
out of the column, and salt flow was interrupted.
Bismuth flow to the column was maintained for about
1% hr. During this time, salt flow was intermittent; the
direction of salt flow reversed three times, corre-
sponding to small surges in the bismuth flow rate.
About half of the 3 liters of bismuth fed to the column
overflowed to the salt catch tank. This was the first
evidence of a flow restriction in the bismuth exit line.
The presence of the constriction was confirmed in the
second run.

In the second run the column was filled with salt, and
the salt overflow line was sealed. Very little salt flowed
through the bismuth exit line to the catch tank when
bismuth was fed to the column. Subsequent exami-
nation of the bismuth outlet line revealed several
deposits of a whiskerlike metallic material, which
analysis showed to be mostly iron. Evidently -iron,
dissolved from the hotter parts of the system, had
deposited in cold spots. Examination of this line also

revealed several areas of severe oxidation on the outer

surface at likely hot spots.

In a third run plugging was avoided, and salt and
bismuth were continuously fed to the column for about
2% hr at flow rates of 90 and 75 cm®/min respectively.
During this run, flow control was poor; the flow rate of -
each phase surged intermittently. As a consequence of
this poor flow control, our measurement of pressure
drop through the column (~40 in. of salt) was erratic
and unreliable. It is believed that the surging of the flow
rate was caused by the presence of bismuth in the low
point of the salt overflow line - from the column.
Probably this line contained bismuth from an earlier
run or from entrainment or flooding at the top of the
column. We believe that we have solved this problem by
draining the low point of the salt overflow line to the
bismuth outlet line. The drain line has been equipped
with an expanded section containing a bubbler-type

 
 

 

230

interface monitor with a freeze valve below it. Thus it
will be possible to catch entrained bismuth and to
measure the rate of accumulation. It will also be
possible to ensure that the overflow line is free of
- bismuth at the start of each run. In addition to this
modification, the' jackleg column used for measuring

salt head has been equipped for automatic level control

to eliminate the changes in salt mventory which had
complicated flow control.

A fourth run was terminated when the bismuth outlet

line from the column failed, spilling about 100 ml of
bismuth and 2800 ml of salt into the catch pan behind
the splash shield. Unfortunately, in this aborted run it
was not possible to confirm improved operation as a
result of the modifications, although the control of the
“level in the jackleg tank was good.

Difficulties have been encountered in using carbon

steel as a material of  construction in these early
engineering experiments. The operating temperature
(600°C) is higher than customary for hardware fabri-
cated of carbon steel, since air oxidation becomes
severe .at temperatures above 600°C. Application of a
high-temperature aluminum paint appears to give some
protection ‘against oxidation; thus this paint has been
applied to all of the replaced lines. The solubility of
iron in bismuth varies from about 20 ppm at 525°C to
about 70 ppm at 625°C. In order to reduce iron
deposition in the lines, we decided to operate the
bismuth feed and catch tanks (where the bismuth
remains in contact with iron for a significant period of
time) at about 540°C. It appears that, in systems of
carbon steel, plugging and line failures may continue to
plague experiments; however, we believe that there will
be successful future runs. When satisfactory flow
control has been demonstrated, UF, will be added to
the salt phase and thorium metal will be added to the
bismuth phase so that mass transfer performance may
be studled

23.2 ELECTROLYTIC CELL DEVELOPMENT

An electrolytic cell is an important and necessary
equipment item in the reductive extraction systems for
isolating protactinium and for removing rare earths.
Work in three areas related to cell development is
reported in the remainder of this section. These consist
of experiments with static cells, installation of the Flow
Electrolytic Cell Facility, and analys1s of mass transfer
in electrolytic cells.

23.2.1 Static Cell Experiments

M. S. Lin C.W.Kee
J. R. Hightower,Jr. L. E. McNeese
The experiments with static cells have been directed
toward solving two problems concerning the elec-
trolyzer in the reductive extraction process: finding an

_electrically insulating material that is capable of with-

standing the highly corrosive cell environment and
devising a method for removing the heat that is
generated by the resistance losses in the salt. Because

frozen salt has the required insulating properties and is

also inert, experiments. are being carried out to explore
the potential of forming frozen salt films in electrolytic
cells, Experiments were performed in which frozen
films were formed along the tops of quartz and
beryllium oxide electrode dividers. These experiments
used only the corrosion resistance properties of the
fitms. One experiment involved the use of an all-metal
cell that required a frozen film to cover completely a
cup containing the bismuth anode. :

Pursuant to the heat generation problem, cell per-
formance was evaluated with both ac and dc sources to
determine if heat transfer studies could be carried out

using an ac source; if feasible, this arrangement would

eliminate the complication of electrochemical reactions
encountered when dc sources are used. A graphite
anode was tested to explore the possibility of using a
solid anode in close proximity to the cathode. A small
anode-tocathode distance is important since this re-
duces the cell resistance and, in turn, the amount of
heat generated. These experiments are summarized
below.

_ Alternating Current Expenment - Heat generation

rates and heat transfer are important aspects of elec-
trolytic cell operation. The use of ac power with
electrolytic cells should provide the same distribution
of heat generation that will be present in cells operating
with dc power and should allow study of the heat
transfer aspects of cell operation without the associated
mass transfer effects produced by dc power. An
experiment using ac power was made in a 4-in.-diam
quartz cell having semicircular bismuth electrodes, each
of which had an area of 33.7 cm?. The cell contained
about 400 cm® each of bismuth and molten salt (66-34
mole % hF-BeF,) and was operated at temperatures
from 500 to 750°C with current densities as high as 5
amp/cm?. The measured cell resistance was the same
regardless of whether alternating or direct current was
used. Although the salt was somewhat less transparent
after operation with ac power, it was concluded that ac .
power can be used without undesirable reactions or side
effects. |
 

 

‘Graphite Anode Experiment. — The use of a solid
anode, such as graphite, has potential advantages. For
example, considerably more freedom in relative place-
ment of the anode-cathode surfaces is possible; this may
allow reduction of the distances separatmg the surfaces

.and hence the heat generation.

A test was made of the feasibility of usmg a graphite
anode in an electrolytic cell operating at a high current
density. The cell consisted of a flat-bottomed 4-in.-diam
quartz tube containing 6.7 kg of bismuth and 1.5 kg of
molten salt (66-34 mole % LiF-BeF,). The bismuth
pool served as the cathode. The anode was a 1-in.-diam
graphite rod located in the salt about % in. from the
bismuth surface. The bottom of .the rod was cut at a
10° angle to facilitate disengagement of the CF, that

formed on the graphite surface. The cathode area was

71 cm?, and the anode area was 5 cm? (considering the
bottom of the rod only). The operating temperature
was 500°C. The cell polarized rapidly when dc voltage
(15 v) was applied to the electrodes. The initial current
was 45 amp (9 amp/cm? at the anode); however, the
current rapidly decreased to 22.5 amp after 5 sec, to

4.5 amp after 17 sec, and reached a nearly constant

231

cell three times during the experiment. In the first
instance 2.6 .v was applied; the cell potential was 1.5 v
(as compared with 2.2 v observed in quartz cells), and
the cell resistance was 0.1 ohm. The cell was shorted
when part of the frozen salt was melted.

In the two subsequent runs the measured cell resist-
ances were 1.35 and 6 ohms respectively. This variation
in resistance was due mainly to the change in effective
anode area. The cell potential remained at about 1.5 v
for the second run but was only about 0.2 v for the last
run. The high resistance and the low cell potential of
the last run suggested that the anode was fully covered
with frozen salt and that a small portion of the
mildsteel cooling tube was unprotected. Inspection of
the cell after cooling revealed that the top section of
the coolant exit line had not been covered by frozen
salt and had corroded through, allowmg cooling water
to enter the cell.

Expenment with Frozen Salt on Quartz Electrode
Divider. — A test was made with a quartz static cell to
assess the difficulty of maintaining a frozen salt
protective film in a region of high heat generation while

~part’ of the frozen salt was in contact with molten

value between 0.2 and 04 amp with intermittent -
increases in current. The cell was also operated withac -
voltage to demonstrate that polarization of the anode

. had limited the current. The alternating current varied

linearly from 12 to 260 amp for applied voltages of 1 to
20 v. It appears that a graphite anode cannot be

bismuth. A Ushaped cooling tube fabricated from
Y4-n. tubing was placed about '/ in. above the quartz

divider in a 44n.-diam quartz cell. The area of each

- semicircular electrode was about 30 ¢cm?.

operated at desired current densities unless a means can

be found for stripping CF, gas from the anode surface.

All-Metal Static Cell Experiment. — The equipment
for the all-metal static cell experiment has been
previously described.? Briefly, the all-metal cell con-
sisted of a cooled anode cup which was surrounded by a
6-in.-diam annular bismuth cathode. The cup had an
inside diameter of 1% in., an outside diameter of 2%,
in., and a total height of 2% in. In operation, a layer of
frozen ‘salt was formed .on the anode container to

prevent its oxidation. The cell was charged with

With no current passing through the cell and with a
purge of argon (0.1 to 0.2 scfh) in each electrode, a salt
film was easily formed on the tube using a mixture of
nitrogen and water as coolant. The temperature of the
salt (66-34 mole % LiF-BeF,) in the cell was approxi-
niately_ 510°C. The frozen film was thicker at the two-
90° bends than along the straight section of the tube.
The thickness of frozen material decreased from about

% in. at the colder end of the divider to about ¥, ¢ in.

sufficient molten salt and bismuth to produce salt and °

metal depths of about 4.8 and 3.5 in. respectively.
It was found that a layer of frozen salt could be

- formed on the anode cup and could be maintained after

the cup was lowered into the bismuth cathode pool.
The thickness of the frozen salt could not, however, be
controlled by adjusting the coolant (nitrogen and
water) rate to the cup. Direct current was applied to the

at the warmer end.
With- the m1t1a_t10n of current flow (ac was used to

avoid forming BiF;, which would react with the

quartz), the molten salt turned a brownish color. With a
heat generation rate of 37.5 w, the salt film was visible

-and appeared to be as thick (approx !4 in.) as with no
. current flow. At higher currents the salt in the cell
. became opaque, making observation of the salt film

impossible. With 4 v between the electrodes, the current
was initially 17.8 amp but decreased to 8.8 amp over a
period of 15 min, This decrease in current may have

been caused by an increase in the thickness of the

frozen salt on the cooling tube and a resulting decrease
in the effective cross section of the cell. With 6 v

‘between the electrodes, the current increased from 13.8

 
 

 

 

to 14.2 amp over a period of about 3 min. At this point

the current and coolant flow were turned off. This
apparently induced thermal stresses in the quartz,
causing it to crack and allowing molten salt to flow out

of the cell.

Examination of the cell after the salt had dramed
from it showed that a salt layer approximately ' in.
thick remained on the coolant tube. The tube with
adherent salt is shown in Fig. 23.1. This salt layer is
believed to represent that present at the end of the
experiment, since the salt drained from the cell in less
than 30 sec.

Experiment with Frozen Salt on Beryllium Omde
Electrode Divider. — The operation of an electrolytic
cell should be simplified somewhat if frozen salt is not
depended upon entirely for electrical insulation and
corrosion protection. For example, the two bismuth
electrodes could be separated by a BeO insulator, while
the small area of the BeO which might be exposed to

 

232

molten salt -(contaihing corrosive BiF;) would be
protected by a layer of frozen salt. Beryllium oxide is

~only slightly soluble in molten salt.

 

To test such an operation we constructed a cell that
used a cup-shaped anode with beryllium oxide as the
electrical insulator between electrodes. Bismuth, which
formed the anode, was contained in the innermost of
three concentric cups, as shown in Fig. 23.2. A cooling
coil, serving also as an anode support and electrical lead,
was welded to the interior cup. The coolant (water and
nitrogen) was introduced and removed from the coil in
concentric tubes. The BeO cup was attached to the
inner cup by four pins; the outer cup was suspended
from the top of the BeO cup by four lugs. There was no
electrical connection between the inner and outer cups.
The anode, whose maximum area was 13.8 cm?, was
placed in a 4-in.-diam quartz enclosure that formed the
concentric bismuth cathode.  The assembled cell is
shown in Fig. 23.3. o

It was rather difficult to form a frozen layer on the
anode cooling ring without bridging the %-in. annular
space between the anode and the quartz vessel. When'
the frozen film did not span this region, it was so thin
that it melted when.the anode was lowered into the
bismuth cathode pool. It finally became necessary to
run the cell with the anode cup located in the salt
phase. A current density of 2 to'S amp/cm? (based on
gross anode area) was obtained. The current was .
unstable, and the total time for the run was only about .

- 7 min. The salt was opaque during most of this time. At

the end of the run, the cell was shorted internally’ even
though a frozen layer extended to the quartz wall;inan
attempt to thaw the frozen salt by reducmg the coolant )
rate, the quartz oell was broken. '

Subsequent examlnatlon of the cell showed that the
layer of frozen salt on the inlet coolmg tube was about- L
% in. thick but was very thin on the coolant outlet
tube. The BeO cup had ‘cracked, probably because of
stresses induced by freezmg salt and ‘bismuth in the
space between the BeO cup and the cladding cups.
Further studies with different anode cup designs are
planned.

- ment. A system for performing sug¢h:an:experiment,

described earlier.? is now being installed in Building
3541. The vessel that will contain the cell, gas-ift
pumps, flow measuring devices, and-transfer lines and a
mixer-settler tank for equilibrating salt and bismuth
streams have been fabricated, assembled, and installed
in a walk-in hood. This equipment is shown in Fig.
234. All heaters and thermocouples have been at-
tached, and the equipment has been insulated. Gas
supplies, electrical power, and instrumentation for the
experiment are now being installed.

An HF-H, treatment vessel, 16 in. OD with a type

304 stainless steel outer shell and a graphite liner, has

also been fabricated for use with the system. Porous
molybdenum filters are included to remove reduced

iron from the purified salt and bismuth. This equipment

was not included in the initial planning of .the system
because it was thought that the use of purified salt and

bismuth in the initial charge would be adequate.

However, high corrosion and mass transfer rates en-
countered in other Jow-carbon steel systems made it
prudent to provide equipment for frequent cleanup of
the salt and bismuth.

Salt and bismuth will be recirculated by gas Jift

~ pumps; the flow rates will be controlled by varying the

gas flow to the lift pumps. Disengagement of the gas

from the liquid and damping of the flow from the lift

pumps are accomplished in disengagement vessels that
also act as gravity-head-type orifice flowmeters.

Since the orifice flowmeters are not of standard
design, experimental determination of the orifice dis-
charge coefficient, Cp, is required. The equation
defining the discharge coefficient is as follows:

Cp=% 8 S 2g . 1)

where
o= volum‘etn'c flow rate,
| p = fluid densxty, ,
A= cross-sectlonal area of onﬁce,
AP = pressure drop across orifice.

Two facilities are avallable for expenmental deter-
mination of the discharge coefficient: a Lucite mockup
for measurements with water and mercury and 2 mild
steel dlsengagement vessel for measurements with salt
and bismuth. Several measurements with water and
mercury and three measurements with bismuth have

been made with an orifice 0.3 cm in diameter. To date,
the results for bismuth have shown considerable scatter.

The discharge coefficient for water was calculated to
be 0.72 * 001 for flow rates from 280 to 470
cm?/min; that for mercury was calculated to be 0.69 +
0.02 for flow rates from 180 to 430 cm®/min. In three
experiments with bismuth, the discharge coefficients
were 0.62 + 0.09, 0.59 + 0.04, and 0.78 + 0.07 at flow
rates of 180, 270, and 430 cm®/min respectively. The
degree of scatter in the results with bismuth is greater
than we can tolerate; however, the decreased amount of
scatter in experiments with water and mercury gives us
reason to expect improvement in additional measure-
ments using bismuth. It is possible that the wetting
characteristics of the bismuth are changing or that the
orifice has been affected by the mass transfer of iron.
We will be able to examine the orifice in the near
future; at that time, such changes may be visible.

More experiments with bismuth and several experi-
ments with molten salt are planned using orifices of
different sizes. If necessary, it will be possible to
calibrate each orifice. to be used in the Flow Elec-
trolytic Cell Facility with the fluid and range of flow
rates of interest.

23.2.3 Analysis of Mass Transfer in
Electrolytic Cells

J.S.Watson L. E. McNeese

In an effort to gain a better understanding of the
proposed electrolytic cells, an analytical study of mass
transfer at the cathode surface is being made. Thus far,
our efforts have been directed toward evaluating a cell

~ containing LiF-BeF;-BiF; but no ThF,. Such a salt is

expected in the electrolytic cell for the rare-earth
removal system. The analytical study is expected to be
useful in estimating (1) maximum current density and
(2) current efficiencies. The principal limitations or
shortcomings of this study result from a lack of
quantitative knowledge of several important parameters
of the system.

For this study the cathode region was assumed to

~consist. of a well-mixed bulk salt, a stagnant salt

boundary layer adjacent to the metal interface, a
stagnant metal boundary layer, and a well-mixed bulk
bismuth region. Lithium and bismuth ions are trans-
ported by diffusive and electromotive forces through

‘the salt boundary layer. Lithium (as metal) then dif-

fuses .through the metal boundary layer into the bulk
metal, Bismuth fluoride was assumed to be reduced
much more readily than LiF; therefore the concentra-
tion of bismuth fluoride at the cathode interface was
set equal to zero. -

 
 

 

 

236

Each metal ion was assumed to exist as a single ionic

_species in the salt phase. Lithium fluoride was assumed
to be completely ionized, but beryllium was assumed to
be in the form of a complex, BeF4?". Since the state of
bismuth fluoride was less well known, two assumptions
were tested: a completely jonized state, Bi**, and a
complexed state, BiFs%~. For estimation of current
efficiencies, the completely ionized assumption is more
conservative. The estimated -current efficiencies with
the Bi%* assumption are shown in Fig. 23.5. The current
efficiency (lithium current/total current) increases with
current density; its value at a current density shghtly
greater than 0.1 amp/cm? is 50%.

The current density cannot be made arbitrarily large, -

however, because of constraints on the system. The
most likely limitation on current density will result if
one chooses to avoid the reduction of beryllium. Since
beryllium is insoluble in-bismuth, its reduction would
introduce a third phase which is hkely to be un-
desirable.

- Conditions leading to the reduction of BeF, were

estimated. The two marks on Fig. 23.5 denote current -

densities that could result in beryllium reduction. The
higher mark, at about 0.65 amp/cm?, gives the current
density at which the salt adjacent to the cathode

becomes (under the simplification of these calculations)
pure BeF,. With higher current densities one would
expect beryllium to be reduced. The lower mark, at
0.16 amp/cm?, represents a point at which beryllium
reduction would more likely start, even though the salt
still contains an appreciable quantity of LiF. This point
was estimated by assuming salt-metal equilibrium at the
cathode interface and the same diffusion coefficients
and boundary layer thickness in both the metal and salt
phases for a given transferring material.

These current densities are lower than we have

‘considered using. It should be kept in mind that a
‘number of approximations have been made in setting

up the mathematical model and that it is necessary to
assume values for a number of parameters (the most
important is the boundary layer thickness). Values
assumed for the important parameters are listed in Fig.
23.5. The D’s denote diffusion coefficients, & is the

boundary layer thickness, and vg; is the molar volume -
of bismuth fluoride. (The molar volumes for the other
components are available from experimental measure-

ments.) An important assumption required for the
calculations is the existence of only one complex or
species for each component (e.g., Bi*', Li*, and
BeF,?7). This assumption is violated at hlgh current
densities where the calculated lithium concentration
near the interface is not high enough to allow (assuming
electroneutrality) sufficient fluoride to completely

. complex the beryllium. Experiments to confirm the

calculated results will be made in the Flow Electrolytlc
Cell Facility. :

23.3 SALT-METAL CONTACTOR DEVELOPMENT

J.S.Watson L. E McNeese

Axial mixing (or diffusion) in the salt phase can
reduce the performance of packed column contactors,
which are proposed for the MSBR fuel processing
system. Effects of axial mixing will be most severe in
the rareearth removal columns, where high flow ratios
are required. We hawe initiated an experimental program

in which axial diffusion coefficients in packed columns

are measured under conditions similar to those in the

proposed reductive extraction processes; mercury and

water are used to simulate bismuth and molten salt. The

~ measured axial diffusion coefficients will be used to

estimate column performance in the proposed systems.
If the required heights for ordinary packed columns are
found to be excessive, devices for reducing axial mixing
will be developed. The calculation of column per-
formance is described in Sect. 23 4. o

)
 

 

 

237

A steadystate technique was used for the axial
diffusivity measurements; its theoretical development
was as follows. Consider a column of constant cross
section in which a fluid moves with constant superficial
velocity v. If a tracer material is introduced near the
column exit, the tracer will tend to diffuse upstream,
and a concentration profile will be established. At
steady state the flux of the tracer due to axial diffusion
is equal to the convective flux; that is, '

dc
_ES =
dZ e,

where
E = axial diffusivity ,
C = tracer concentration at position Z ,
v = superficial fluid velocity ,
Z = position along column .

Integration of this relation, assuming that the concen-
tration at point Z, is C,, yields the relation

C_ v,
lncl -———E(Z-—Zl), ‘

which indicates that a semilogarithmic plot of C/C; vs
Z should yield a straight line of slope —v/E.

The experimental technique for measuring the con-
centration profile is as follows. A small stream of water
(flow rate, approximately 1 ml/min) is withdrawn from
the column, circulated through a cell containing a light
source and a photocell, and then returned to the
column at the same elevation. This circulating side
stream is driven by a small centrifugal pump containing
a magnetically coupled impeller. The cells are cylindri-

cal in shape and have a % -in. inside diameter. The light .

path, % in. in length, is along the axis of the cell. The
light source is a G.E. No. 253X lamp, and the detectors
are Clairex CL707L photoresistors.

The tracer material, cupric nitrate solution, is injected
near the top of the column with a syringe pump.
Several sampling points are located at various positions
down the column. The composition in each photocell is
followed on a recorder until steady state is reached;
with a 4-ft column, this normally takes 2 to 4 hr. The
solutions to be analyzed are very -dilute, and the
response of the photoresistors is essentially linear (a
limited form of Beer’s law), as confirmed by experi-
ment. Readmgs are taken for each detector both with
no tracer present (eg., with the column containing
water) and with a single calibration  solution. This

C/C,, RELATIVE CONCENTRATION RATIO

calibration solution is generated by injecting a small
amount of tracer into the column when no water is
flowing; after the tracer has been mixed throughout the
column, each detector can be calibrated at the same
tracer concentration. Such a calibration is made at the
beginning of each run. This procedure requires that
only relative concentrations, rather than absolute con-
centrations, be measured.

The results of a typical run are shown in Fig. 23.6. In
this case the column was packed with 3-in.-diam
Raschig rings, and the mercury and water flow rates
were 9.1 and 29 ft/hr respectively. The axial diffusion
coefficient is calculated from the slope of the line
drawn through the data. Results obtained in seven runs
indicate that the axial diffusion coefficient is approxi-
mately 3.5 cm?/sec. The data correspond to several
water rates (as well as several mercury rates). The
conditions used in the runs are given in Table 23.1. It is
possible that the axial diffusivity increases as the flow
ratio increases, but this increase is relatively small and
cannot be confirmed by the data. Additional data will
be required to determine whether such a dependence
actually exists. Note that although the water and
mercury rates were varied, all of the data were taken at
less than 50% of the estimated flooding rate. We may
find in subsequent experiments that E is essentially
constant over a wider range of flow rates; however, one
should not presently extrapolate these findings to

23.4 EFFECT OF AXIAL MIXING ON
EXTRACTION COLUMN HEIGHT

H. D. Cochran, Jr.

In a two-phase flow countercurrent operation, longi-
tudinal dispersion (or axial mixing) has a detrimental
effect on equipment performance. We have made
calculations to determine the effects of axial mixing on
the performance of columns being considered for
isolating protactinium and for removing rare earths.
Calculations that show the characteristics of devices for
reducing the effects of backmixing were also made. '

Axial mixing in packed columns has been studied by
who developed analytical
solutions to differential equations describing longi-
tudinal dispersion accompanying mass transfer between .
two phases in countercurrent flow. Concentrations of a
transferring component within a contactor and at the
outlet were shown to depend upon four dimensionless
parameters that are functions of the dispersion rates
and velocities, the distribution coefficient between the
phases, and the overall mass transfer coefficients. These
relationships can be applied to contactors for the MSBR
flowsheet if several simplifying assumptions are made.
These include: (1) The transfer of only one component

41, ‘Miyauchi and T. Vermeulen, Ind, Eng. Chem, Funda-

is treated; (2) the distribution ratio for this component

is constant throughout the column; (3) salt and metal

flow rates are constant throughout the column; and (4)

“the axial diffusion coefficient is constant throughout

the column. Backmixing was consxdered in the salt
phase only.

The analytical solution developed by Mxyauchl and
Vermeulen is quite complicated, and it was found that
within the range of interest the results could be
approximated sufficiently well by the followmg empiri-
cal relation:

- .
n=1—(£29+1—-F+ 1) ,

 

NTU NTU

where _
1= column efficiency = NTU/NTU* = L/L*,

NTU = number of salt-phase transfer units in plug
flow column,

~ NTU* = number of salt-phase transfer units in back-
mixed column,

L =length of plug flow column,
L* =length of backmixed column,
Np, = Peclet number = Vst/E,
.V, = superficial velocity of salt phase,
_E = axial diffusivity,
F = extraction factor = SD/M,
- §=salt flow rate, ,
D = distribution coefficient,
M = metal flow rate. ,
To interpret this relation we must have estimates of
NTU, F, and Np, for the columns of interest. The
results are summarized in Table 23.2 for the four
columns that constitute the MSBR processing system.
For the protactinium columns, where the assumption
of constant D is poor, calculations were made for

several D’s over the range of variation. It was found that
the results are largely independent of the value of D.

The most important observation was that the efficiency

of the column is high; that is, backmixing will require

that the length of the column be increased by less than

10% over that of a column in which no backmixing
occurs.

The values of F were computed from ﬂowsheet
calculations of McNeese.® The estimate of HTU (3.2 ft)

- used in calculating Np, and L* was taken from the

experimental results of Johnson et al® A value of 3.5
cm?/sec was used for E in calculating Np_ . This number
is based on measurements made with columns packed
with %-in. Raschig rings (described in Sect. 23.3). The
column height is acceptably low and is dependent only
upon the number of transfer units desired.

For the rare-earth columns, extraction factors corre-
sponding to rare-earth—thorium separation factors, «,
of 1.2, 1.5, and 2.0 were calculated from the flowsheet
calculations of McNeese.’ The same values for HTU
(3.2 ft) and axial diffusivity (3.5 cm?/sec) were
assumed as for the protactinium columns (see above).
In the upper column, efficiencies were quite low and
were strongly dependent on Np, and NTU. It appears
likely that column heights will be excessive in this

section. In the lower part of the rare-arth system, low
efficiencies and very long columns are a certainty since

the Peclet number is low and the number -of transfer
units required is high.

Because of the detrimental effect of backmixing on |

column performance, the effect of segmenting the
rare<carth column at intervals with backflow preventers

- was investigated. The model used in this study was a
staged column featuring salt-phase backflow between

adjacent stages. As in the previous calculations the
rare-earth extraction system was simplified in order to

pérmit consideration of only one component trans-

ferring between immiscible phases with constant molar

flow rates. The equilibrium distribution coefficient of
this component between the two phases was assumed to
remain constant through the column.

Multicomponent mass,balance equations with vanable
distribution coefficients have been solved by McNeese
for staged columns with no backflow (see Sect. 22.2).
These results- constitute the basis of the reference
flowsheet for MSBR fuel processing and indicate that 5
and 19 theoretical stages will be required in the upper
and lower columns, respectively, of the rare-earth
extraction system. Metal and salt flow rates and
rare-earth concentrations in the feed and product salt
and metal were taken from McNeese’s calculations. It
was also necessary to select the constant distribution
coefficient, D, which, with no salt backflow, would
produce the same degree of extraction as that obtained

~ with variable distribution coefficients. Once the proper

value of D had been obtained, solution of the problem
with  various degrees of salt backﬂow was stralght-
forward.

The column efficiency (i.e., the ratio of the number
of theoretical stages to the number of mechanical
stages) was found to decrease approximately linearly

" with the percentage of salt throughput that returns

through the backflow preventers.” To achieve stage -
efficiencies of 75% or greater, the return flow through

“the preventer must be less than 17.5% of the salt flow

in the upper colurn and less than 25% in the lower
column. As noted earlier, the need for backflow
preventers is most critical in the lower portion of the

 
 

 

240

rare-earth column, where a back circulation of salt as -

high as 25% can be tolerated. Development of backflow
preventers with this effectiveness seems practical.

23.5 AXIAL MIXING IN BUBBLE COLUMNS
M. S. Bautista L. E. McNeese

Axial mixing is important in the design of tubular
reactors in which a reaction between a gas and a liquid
occurs (e.g., a continuous fluorinator). Experiments
were made to study axial mixing during the counter-
current flow of air and water in a 2-in.-diam column. A

- steady-state experimental technique was employed in

which the concentration of a tracer, copper(Il) nitrate,
was measured at points along the column by photo-

~ metric analysis. It was found that the axial diffusion

coefficient was independent of column height and
water flow rate and that, above a certain height, radial

bottom of the column. Solution was circulated between
the column and each of the cells at the rate of 0.12
cm3/sec, a rate sufficiently low that mixing in the
column was unaffected. '
The variation of the dispersion coefficient with air
flow rate for two superficial water velocities is shown in
Fig. 23.7. From the close agreement of the data points,
it was concluded that varying the water velocity has no

~ effect on the dispersion coefficient. This observation

suggests that the relative velocity between water and
rising bubbles is approximately the same for both cases;
therefore the degree of turbulence or mixing should be
similar. The slope of the curve abruptly increases at an
air flow rate of 31 cm®/sec. Above this rate excessive
bubble coalescence or slugging occurred, resulting in the
formation ‘of bubbles which expanded in size to

. approximately that of the column diameter.

gradients were negligible. Dispersion coefficients in-

creased slowly as the air rate was increased until
excessive bubble coalescence or “slugging” was ob-
served (about 1.9 std liters/min); above this point the
dispersion coefficients increased more rapidly.

The underlying theory for the measurement of axial
diffusion coefficients has been developed in Sect. 23.3.
The experimental system consisted of a 2-in.-diam,
7-ftdong column that was equipped with 20 cells spaced
at 3-n. intervals for determining concentrations in the
column. Means were provided for maintaining constant,
known flow rates of air and water to the column and
for feeding copper nitrate solution (i.e., tracer) near the

24. DlStlllathIl of MSRE Fuel Carrier Salt

J
L. McNeese ‘

'An experiment demoristrating the high-.tempe'r_ature,
low-pressure distillation of irradiated MSRE fuel carrier
salt has been successfully completed. Although the

~ quantity of salt processed was less than that anticipated

(12 liters vs 48 liters), the objectives of the experiment
were met in an extremely smooth 3 1-hr operation.

"The equipment for the experiment and its installation
at the MSRE have been described previously.! The

. .attempt to transfer 48 liters of irradiated MSRE -fuel

salt (containing no uranium) from the fuel storage tank
(FST) to the still feed tank was initiated by evacuating
the feed tank, which contained about' 2 liters of
unirradiated salt, to 1.5 psia. After about 12 liters of
salt had been transferred from the FST, the feed tank
pressure rose from 4 psia to atmospheric pressure over a
period of about 2 min, indicating that gas was being
drawn through the transfer line. Repeated attempts to

E.

transfer more salt by evacuating the still feed tank -

failed, although the bubbler in the FST indicated that

additional salt was present. After establishing that the
freeze valve in the transfer line could be sealed we -

decided to proceed with the experiment.
To start the experiment, 7 liters of salt was trans-
ferred from the feed tank to the still pot. The still pot

~ was heated to 900°C, and distillation was initiated by

H.D. Cochran, Jr.
B. A. Hannaford

When the remaining salt in the feed tank (7 liters) had
been distilled, a salt plug was frozen in the line from the
feed tank to the still pot, and four of the seven liters of
salt in the still pot were subsequently evaporated. The
still ‘pot temperature during this part of the run was
980°C, and the condenser pressure was about 0.1 mm
Hg.

During the first part of the run (semicontinuous), the
average distillation rate was about 0.71 liter/hr; during
the second part (batch), the average rate was about 0.30
liter/hr. In nonradioactive semicontinuous operation,
distillation rates of about 0.9 liter/hr were achieved.
The. distillation rate was limited by the condenser
capacity in the radioactive semicontinuous operation.
The heat removal capability of the condenser in the
radioactive operation was lower than in the nonradio-
active operation because more insulation had inad-
vertently been installed on the condenser at the MSRE
and because air circulation across the condenser was
lower. High LiF ‘concentrations in the still pot liquid
during the batch operation caused the vapor pressure
over the still pot liquid to be lower than during the
semicontinuous operation, which, in turn, caused the

‘vaporization rate to be lower, These rates are consistent

in the still pot. During this part of the run the still pot
- temperature was slowly increased ‘to 980°C. During the
" experiment, temperatures at the condenser exit became

abnormally high, indicating that the condenser capacity

~ remaining salt in the feed tank was fed with the
- automatic control system maintaining a constant level

with rates measured in the nonradioactive tests.

- Eleven condensate samples were taken during _the,run
at approximately 90-min intervals. When these samples

- were removed at the end of the experiment, radiation

was being exceeded. By increasing the condenser

pressure to 0.8 mm Hg, the distillation rate was reduced
to 2 value that allowed the condenser exit temperature

 to remain acceptably low (about. 700 C). .

where y;.r and y; are mole fractions in the vapor
(condensate) and x; ;¢ and x; are mole fractions in the
liquid (still pot). Concentrations in the still pot were
not measured directly during the run; however, data

taken during the experiment allowed these concen-

trations to be estimated from material balances for each
component. Concentrations of *5Zr, 14%Ce, ?°Sr, and
197Pm in the feed salt were measured directly. Con-
centrations of other fission products such as '7Cs in
the feed salt were calculated using estimated fission
product concentrations in the MSRE. Except for fission
products with longlived gaseous precursors, these
estimated concentrations have generally agreed with
measured concentrations. Such is the case, for example,
for 144Ce, ?5Zr, and ?°Sr. For '*7Pm, however, the
measured concentration in the feed salt was only about
34% of the calculated concentration. For the present
the effective relative volatility of '*7Pm calculated
from the condensate analyses will be based on the
measured '*7Pm concentration rather than the calcu-
lated number. It should be noted that, because the
analysis for ** "Pm is difficult and because the measured
and calculated concentrations for comparable materials
agree so well, the calculated concentration of !*?Pm in
the feed is probably better than the measured concen-
tration. In case this is true, the relative volatilities for

- ¥47Pm which are discussed below are actually only 34%

of the values given.

The effective relative volatilities of fluorides of Be,
Zr, and °5Zr are shown in Fig. 24.1. The effective
relative volatility of BeF, remained constant at a value
of 5.4 during the semicontinuous operation but rose

gradually to 8.4 during the batch operation. The value
measured during semicontinuous operation was in fair
agreement with the value measured with equilibrium
stills in LiF-BeF, systems (i.e., 4.7) 2 The tendency of
the value to increase during batch’ distillation is in
qualitative agreement with measurements® in the LiF-
BeF,-ThF, systems which showed that the relative
volatility of BeF, increases as the mole fraction of
BeF; in the liquid decreases.

The relative volatility of zirconium (both natural
zirconium and fission product *5Zr) decreased from
about 4 at the start of the experiment to a constant
value near 2 about halfway through the semicontinuous
operation. It then decreased further during the batch
distillation to about 1. These values are consistent with

~ those measured under equilibrium conditions. The

material balance calculations show that the Z1F,
concentration in the still pot decreases near the start of
the semicontinuous portion, levels off near the end of
the semicontinuous portion, then decreases further
during the batch operation. Since it is known that the
activity coefficient of ZrF; is low at low ZrF,
concentrations in LiF-BeF, systems and increases with
increasing Z1F, concentration, one would expect the
trend seen in the run.

Figure 24.2 shows the relatlve volatility of ‘37Cs
which decreased during the experiment from nearly 10
initially to approximately 0.1 at the end of the
experiment. Smith et al.> measured a value of 95.1 for

®c,r in a mixture of LiF-BeF, containing O .03 mole %

CsF. The values of the relative volatility of '37Cs
calculated from the sample analyses are very sensitive to
the assumed feed concentration of *37Cs. If the feed

- concentrations were only 60% of the estimated value

used for these calculations, the resulting a’s would be
higher by about a factor of 10. The large change in a
for *®7Cs during the course of the run could be a
consequence of concentration polarization; this possi-
bility is being explored by calculations.

The effective relative volatility of '44Ce (Fig. 24.3)
increased from about 6 X 107 at the start of the
experiment to about 1 X 1072 at the end of the
experiment. Figure 24.3 also shows the relative vola-
tility of '*7Pm, which was initially less than 2.3 X

25.1 HEAT TRANSFER THROUGH THE FROZEN
SALT WALLS OF AN ELECTROLYTIC CELL

E.L. Nicholson. '

~Natural convection heat transfer coefficients, heat
fluxes, and the thickness of the insulating film of frozen
salt were calculated for a hypothetical cell having a
0.1-ft-high vertical wall protected with an insulating
layer of frozen salt and containing molten bismuth with
molten salt floating on top. The temperature of the
molten salt and bismuth was assumed to be 100°F
higher than the melting point of the salt, 930°F
(500°C), although the salt melts over the range of 824
to 842°F and finally becomes liquid at 930°F. This lack
of a sharp melting point may lead to a poor-quality
slushlike salt dei:osit at certain temperatures. For the
bismuth in contact with the frozen salt wall, the natural
convection heat transfer coefficient, 4., was calculated
to be 728 Btu hr™! ft™ °F™!, and the heat flux, Q,
was calculated to be 72,800 Btu hr™! ft™. The
corresponding values for the molten salt in contact with
the frozen salt wall were h, = 148 Btu hr™! ft™2 °F !

and Q = 14,800 Btu hr " ft™2,

It was assumed that a 0.01-ft (approximately % -in.)
thickness of frozen salt was the minimum that could be
tolerated for electrical insulation of the container wall

in contact with molten bismuth. Thermal conductivity

data for solid MSBR salt' were expressed by k = 2.51 —
1.93 X 1073 (°F) (English units). The temperature
drop over the 0.01-ft-thick frozen salt film was found
to be 574°F for the heat flux calculated for bismuth in
contact with frozen layer, and the surface of the cold
metal container will be required to remain at a
temperature of 356°F or less (bismuth melts at 520°F).
Hence a cell coolant consisting of a low-melting metal
(e.g., NaK) or more conventional materials (e.g., pres-

surized water or gas-water spray mixtures) would have
to be used. The frozen salt insulator in contact with
molten salt immediately above the bismuth layer was
calculated to-be 0.05 ft (0.6 in.) thick if the coolant is
at 356°F. ' -

The preceding calculations are for a highly simplified
geome'try and do not account for concentrated local
heating effects, fluid flow, possible nonadherence of
frozen salt films to walls, local freezing of bismuth, etc.,
that may affect heat transfer in an actual cell. The
control of all parameters affecting cell operation and of
thermal stresses in the materials of construction will be
very difficult.

- Calculations for a system using mercury as a stand-in

for bismuth and water as a stand-in for salt showed that
this system has heat transfer characteristics at low
temperature that are similar to those of the salt-bismuth
system at higher temperature. The water-mercury
combination would be useful for mockup purposes
since experiments at high temperatures with salt and
bismuth are difficult. ' '

that dissolution is rapid and that the solubility of PuF;
in fuel salt is adequate. Pressure tests of the capsule at §
psi show no leakage of the joint between the foil disks
and the capsule wall. The capsule is vented through a
sintered nickel filter positioned in a small hole in the
top of the capsule to prevent internal pressure buildup
and premature rupturing of the foil disks before the
capsule is immersed in salt. The loaded capsule should
provide good containment of the PuF; powder. Fabri-
cation of the capsules is under way. :

A new 6-ft glove box and an existing glove box in
building 3019 will be used for the capsule filling

operation. In the first glove box the capsules will be
filled with powder; then the top plug of each will be
inserted, pinned, and sealed in place; finally the
capsules will be decontaminated and weighed. Addi-
‘tional decontamination, if necessary, and packaging in
the MSRE fuel enrichment capsule carriers will be done
in the second glove box. Capsule filling procedures are
being tested using talcum powder as a stand-in for
PuF;. Safety reviews for the capsule filling operation
have been submitted for approval. The first shipment of
PuF; is scheduled to arrive September 2, 1969; capsule
filling will start shortly thereafter.
