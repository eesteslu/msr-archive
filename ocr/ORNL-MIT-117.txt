. SUMMARY

One characteristic of Molten Salt Breeder Reactors (MSBR} is the rela-
tively large quantity of tritium which would be produced in the salt fuel
stream. Tritium, like hydrogen, can permeate most metals at elevated temp-
eratures, and thereby contaminate the environment. An efficient means of
removing and concentrating tritium from the fuel stream is essential to the
development of MSBR.

In this project it was assumed that the tritium can be removed from
the fuel stream by a hydrogen-heiijum purge and that the helium can be
separated from the hydrogen for recycle via a paliadium membrane. Four
systems were conceptualized, designed, and economically evaluated toc con-
centrate or store the hydrogen and tritium: storage of unconcentrated
tritiated water, water distillation, gaseous thermal diffusion and cryo-
genic distillation of 1iquid hydrogen. On the basis of this evaluation
the most economical system, cryogenic distillation, would provide a 1000-
fold tritium enrichment at an estimated capital cost of $328,000 and an
annual operating cost of $81,000,

2. INTRODUCTION

There is presently interest at ORNL in the development of Molten Sait
Breeder Reactors {MSBR}. A characteristic of these reactors, however, is
the generation of large quantities of tritium (half 1ife 12.36 yr). Tritium,
1ike hydrogen, has a very high permeability through most metals at tempera-
ture and concentration levels of the moiten salt; therefore if 1t is not
removed, it will escape from the reactor and contaminate the environment.

Tritium is a weak beta emitter (18.6 kev), but it exchanges readily
with hydrogen and as tritiated water can enter the body by penetrating the
skin. The effect of radiation in a very localized area and the transmuta-
tion of tritium to helium within the body may be of biological significance

(1.

One proposed method of removing the tritium from the MSBR fuel stream
is by means of a helium-hydrogen purge (2). The hydrcgen stream would
then be separated from the helium and the tritium would be concentrated
and stored as tritiated water (HTO). Since tritium is an isotope, its
concentration will depend mainly on physical separation processes.

In the MSBR concept the primary salf stream is comprised of molten
salts of uranium, tithium, beryilium, and thorium. The primary salt cir-
culates through the reactor where a critical mass is achieved and fission
occurs. The sensible heat generated by fission is transferred to a steam
cycle by means of a secondary salt stream. The flow plan is illustrated
in Fig. 1,

3. DESIGN AND EVALUATION OF ALTERNATE SEPARATION SYSTEMS
3.1 Approach

In this study it was assumed that the tritium could be remcved from
the fuel stream by a mixed helium and hydrogen purge. The hydrogen and
tritium would then be removed from the purge stream and concentrated. The
selection of the most feasible system for effecting the desired concentra-
tion was based on a preliminary design and cost estimate for each system.
The systems studied were storage of the unconcentrated tritium as tritiated
water, water distillation, thermal diffusicon, and cryogenic distillation of
Tiguid hydrogen.

The design for all the systems was based on 111,000 gmoies of hydrogen
per day at an H/T = 106, A 100- to 1000-fold enrichment was desired (i.e.,
H/T = 103 to 10% in the product stream} with a 99 to 99.9% recovery of the
tritium. In all cases the product tritium is to be stored as water on the
MSBR site (2). For all processes the separation equipment will be en-
closed in a separate building to isolate any possible tritium leak.

3.2 Feed Pretreatment

The purge stream will contain helium, hydrogen, and tritium as well as
gaseous fission products such as krypton, xenon, icdine, and hydrogen fluo-
ride. It is proposed to pass the purge stream through a charcoal bed to g
adsorb some of the gaseous fission products. To separate the helium for
recycle from the hydrogen and tritium, & palladium "kidney" would be
employed. A palladium membrane which passes 15 scfh of Hp costs approxi-
mately $5000 (4). When the six-tenths power formula is applied to scale
to the capacity required for the MSBR, an estimated purchase cost of
$136,000 is realized.

It is estimated that the installed cost of the palladium kidney is
four times the purchase cost of the kidney, or approximately $544,000.
The same cost will be associated with each of the four alternate systems.
A second item which is common to the four processes is the oxidation
equipment and its installed cost is estimated to be $136,000.

3.3 Storage of Tritiated Water

The hydrogen and tritium would be oxidized after passing through the
palladium kidney and the resulting tritiated water condensed and sent to
a storage tank. Storage of tritiated water will require steel tanks en-
cased in a concrete tank. Should a leak develop, the liguid would be con-
tained, but an additional tank would be required to effect a transfer
before final repairs could be made (5). The tanks were sized to hold
30 years production of tritium, the expected lifetime of the reactor. The
Tiquid will have to be stored until the activity has decreased to less than
1% (approximately 110 yr). At a production rate of 2000 Titers/day, a tank
capacity of approximately 5.8 million gallons is required. With an esti-
mated capital cost of $1/gal (5), the two-tank system would have a capital
cost of $11.6 million. Annual operating cost for this sytem would be the
cost of the hydrogen and oxygen burned to form the water ($143,000) and the
maintenance cost [2% of the capital cost (13)], $232,000. (See Appendix
7.1 for details.}

3.4 Water Distiilation

During World War II the United States built and successfully operated
several water distillation plants to produce heavy water. The low vaiue of
the relative volatility (o), however, required the use of high reflux ratios
and a large number of plates in the distillation column.

Distillation to separate tritiated water (HTO) is not as difficult as

that for heavy water, since the value for o is several percent higher. A
plot of relative volatility versus pressure indicates that such & system
should be operated under vacuum to take advantage of the higher value of o
(see Fig. 2). A computer program was written to size the distillation
column. The design of the column is based on the use of a high efficiency
packing such as Sulzer CY (designed for use in heavy water systems). This
packing was found to have 21 theoretical plates/meter and a pressure drop

| of 0.19 torr/theoretical plate (6) for heavy water separations at a liguid

g Toading of 2000 kg/M2-hr and a column head pressure of 120 mm Hg. Move
favorable conditions might be achieved with the tritium system by lowering
the head pressure of the column.

As shown in Fig. 3 the number of theoretical plates is a sharp function
ocf the reflux ratio. Figure 4 is a schematic diagram of the propcsed water
distillation design. The optimum systems and operating conditions were
determined by varying the reflux ratic for different enrichment and recovery
factors (see Tables 4 and 5 in Appendix 7.1). Table 2 shows the major de-
sign specifications and the cost estimates for the optimized systems. Cap-
ital _costs for 99% recovery are $422,700 at H/T = 104 and $362,600 at H/T
= 103. For 99.9% recovery, capital costs are $536,600 at H/T = 104 and
$484,600 at H/T = 103. Although the cotumn packing and building costs are
hiﬂher for K/T = 10°, the overall cost is less than for H/T =
10% because of the associated storage costs. The cost of recovering 99.9%
of the tritium for H/T = 103 is 33% higher than the cost for 99% recovery.
Operating costs in all four cases are essentially the same, $220,000 annually.
The cost of Ho is the major operating expense, $128,000 annually. A break-
down of the column costs for other reflux ratics is in Appendix 7.1.

3.5 Thermal Diffusion

Thermal diffusion is based cn a temperature gradient in a mixture of
gases which gives rise to a concentration gradient, thereby effecting a
partial separation. Jones and Furry (9) have presented a detailed discus-
sion on the theory and design of thermal diffusion systems for binary sepa-
rations. The thermal diffusion constant between two species with masses
m] and m2 is equal to (mp - m])/(mz + m), and for a hydrogen-tritium
system this ratio is 1/3 which is considered high.

In a thermal diffusion column the separation rate is fixed by the
temperature and pressure of the system. Theory requires that the rate of
production of each column be small compared with the rate of thermal djf-
fusion., The production rate of tritium in an MSBR is so large that 103 to
10% thermal diffusion columns operated in parallel would be necessary.
Based on the theory of Jones and Furry, Verhagen and Sellschop (11) designed
and operated a thermal diffusion system for tritium enrichment. A scaleup
of their apparatus would require 5150 parallel systems for a 1000-fold en-
richment with a power load of 100,000 kwh. The power consumption at
$0.004/kwh would cost $2.9 million per year. (See Appendix 7.2 for appa-
ratus details and operating conditions.)

3.6 Cryogenic Distillation

Due to recent advances in cryogenic engineering, several plants have
been constructed which separate deuterium from hydrogen by cryogenic dis-
tillation of the liquid hydrogen feed. The relative volatility of H2 to HT
is not available, but it is believed to be equal to, if not greater, than
the relative volatility for the Ho-HD system (o ® 1.6 at 1.5 atm). This
is considerably higher than the relative volatility for the water-tritiated
water system (o ¥ 1.05). A second advantage is the Tower consumption of
Ho and 02. For the separation of tritium by water distillation, all the
Ho from the purge stream is oxidized to water, but in the cryogenic system

only the final product is burned, and the remainder, more than 99% of the
Ho can be recycled.

The tiquid hydrogen distillation system is based on a plant built by
Gebrider Sulzer for heavy water production in DOMAT/EMS, Switzerland {18,
19). A schematic for this plant is shown in Fig. 5. The hydrogen feed
is initially compressed to 3.7 atm, cooled in a series of three heat ex-
changers {Nos. 1, 2, and 3), then liguified and re-evaporated in the feed
liquifier before it enters the column. The vapor from the top of the col-
umn is split into two streams. One stream passes through exchangers 3, 2,
and 1 to cool the feed, and then is recycled to the hydrogen purge stream.
The remainder passes through exchangers 4 through 8, exchanging against the
returning reflux stream. It exits exchanger 8 at ambient temperatures, and
enters the reflux compressor. Because of interstage compressor cocling,
the H2 gas leaves the compressor at 14 atm and 300°K. The stream re-enters
exchanger 8 and the expansion turbines, and finally exits exchanger 5 as
saturated vapor at 4.5 atm. The saturated vapor then passes through the
bottom of the column where it is condensed by boiling the liquid in the
reboiler. The stream passes through exchanger 4, flashes to 1.5 atm, and
enters the column as saturated liquid.

The computer code used in Sect. 3.4 was modified for use with this
system. Calculations showed that a column with 100 theoretical stages op-
erating at a reflux ratio of two would yield a separation of H/T = 103 at
a recovery of 99.9%. Although calculations showed that a reflux ratic of
two was sufficient for the desired separation, the design was based on a
reflux ratio of five to allow for variation of the operating conditions
and to ensure a conservative cost estimate. With a packing material simi-
lar to Sulzer CY, the column would be only 13 ft high at a liguid loading
of 1500 kg/mZ-nr (6). As seen in Table 3 the column cost represents a
small fraction of the total cost; therefore, the less difficult separations
were neglected in the analysis.

Capital cost is estimated at $328,100 and operating costs at $80,600
annually. The building for this system must not only isolate. the system,
but alsc insulate the apparatus for the low temperatures involved. The
distillation column and the low temperature heat exchangers and expansion
turbines are enclosed in steel vacuum bottles to maintain cryogenic temp-
eratures. No cost information was obtainable on the new high efficiency
insulation currently being used on some cryogenic equipment. However, it
is believed that the cost estimate presented is conservative. The cost of
the expansion turbines was estimated from cost information for a 200 ton/
day oxygen plant. This unit has 100 times the capacity reqguired for the
hydrogen liquification unit. Further details on the cryogenic distiltlation
system, including an explanation of the cost estimate, are given in Appen-
dix 7.3.

4, DISCUSSION OF SEPARATION SYSTEMS

Storage of tritiated water without any form of concentration reguires
a capital cost twenty times greater than for water distillation and thirty-
five times that of cryogenic distillation. Thermal diffusion alsc represents
an unsatisfactory sclution to the problem of tritium concentration. Moni-
toring over 5000 two-stage thermal diffusion columns and maintaining control
of the feed to each column appears horrendous; and the annual power cost of
$2.9 mitlion certainly makes this system unfeasible.

Water distillation is a technically sound alternative. However, its
capital and operating costs are not competitive with those of cryogenic
distillation. The packing represents the major capital expense, and since
all of the hydrogen is oxidized to water, the major operating expense is
the cost of hydrogen. However, if the hydrogen concentration in the purge
stream is sufficiently high, it might be feasible to oxidize the hydrogen
directly without the use of a palladium kidney and separate it from the
purge stream as water. This would not be sufficient to make water distil-
lation competitive with the cryogenic system based on operating costs.

Cryogenic distillation has the lowest capital cost estimate as well as
the Towest operating costs. Part of the economic advantage is realized by
recycling 99.9% of the hydrogen to the purge stream. It should be noted
that the cryogenic distillation was designed for a reflux ratio of five,
although for 99.9% recovery at H/T = 10°, a reflux ratio of two is sufficient.
Thus the system is capablie of recoveries in excess of 99.9% at concentrations
Tower than H/T = 103,

5. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Cryogenic distillation of liquid hydrogen is the most economical of
the alternatives studied. A cryogenic distillation §ystem which will enrich
4630 gmole/hr of hydrogen from H/T = 106 to H/T = 10° at 99.9% recovery has
an estimated capital cost of $328,100 and an estimated annual operating cost
of $80,600 (excluding depreciation). There is also the associated capital
cost of $680,000 for the palladium pretreatment and oxidizing systems.

2. HWater distillation or storage of unconcentrated tritiated water
represents too great a capital expenditure and annual operating cost.

3. Thermal diffusion is unattractive for concentrating tritium from a
1000 Mw(e) MSBR.

7.2 Thermal Diffusion System

The theory of Jones and Furry (9} states that the temperature and pres-

sure fix the operating parameters of a thermal diffusion system.

The calcu-

tations are presented to illustrate that thermal diffusion systems of the

scale required by an MSBR are uneconomical,

From Equations 70-72 of Jones

and Furry, we obtain for concentric columns:

These equations are used subject to the constraint that 5 <K_/

McInteer (10} has reported that o/H must be much less than one; and
from Jones and Furry (9) we see that o/H should be on the order of 10-%4 to
10-6 for each stage. MSBR requirements are such that the total flow rate
is 9.55 x 10-4 g/sec. To satisfy theory 104 to 106 columns in paraiiel
will be required. Based on the theory of Jones and Furry, Verhagen and
Sellschop (11) designed and operated a thermal diffusion system for tritium
enrichment.  Their apparatus is schematically shown in Fig. 6. The speci-
fications are given in Table 6.

Table 6. Thermal Diffusion System of Verhagen and Sellschop (11)

 

Stage 1 Stage 2
Type of unit concentric tube hot wire

Temperature, hot wall 600°K 1200°K
Temperature, cold wall 1 300°K 300°K
Power consumption 18.5 kwh 1.66 kwh
Pressure 1 atm I atm

 

At the required enrichment of 1000-fold, this system has a production
capacity of only 0.125 cc(STP)/min of tritium. Based on this design approx-
imately 5150 systems in parallel are necessary to process the 642 cc(STP)/
min from the MSBR. Aside from the extreme difficulty in maintaining a
uniform feed rate to each column [to which thermal diffusion systems are
very sensitive (9)], the 9ower consumption is extremely high. The overall
system requires 72.7 x 107 kwh/yr at $0.004/kwh or a yearly power cost of
$2.9 million.

The specifications given in Table 3 were based on an o of 1.6. This
value is for a hydrogen-deuterium system; however, it is believed that the
a for the tritium system would be at least as great if not greater. g

Computer calculations were made for the four different separations at
various reflux ratios and for both saturated liquid and saturated vapor
feeds. Selected results are presented in Table 7.

For a liquid feed and R = 2, it is seen that lowering H/T from 104 to

103 causes an increase of only five stages for either 99.0 or 99.9% recovery.

The difference between 99 and 99.9% recovery is 40 plates at R = 2, but NTP
is still under 100 for 99.9% recovery. If the feed is a saturated vapor,
NTP is slightly higher but the difference is insignificant. NTP drops
rapidly at reflux ratios above 2. A 10% increase in reflux from 2 to 2.2
lowers NTP from 98 to 76, and increasing the reflux from 2 to 3 lowers NTP
from 93 to 49.

In view of these results it was felt that a column with 100 theoretical
stages operating at & reflux ratio of 2 would be adequate for the most dif-
ficuit separation, i.e., recovery = 99.9% and H/T = 103, However, in calcu-

lating the cost of the system a reflux ratio of 5 was used toc provide opera-
tional flexibility, conservative separation capability, and cost estimate.

From this equation the work of compressing the feed was calculated:

of 4630 mole/hr,

W = (4385 kca]/hr‘) (m—

0 6.8 HP
A 20% margin of safety was allowed and an overall efficiency of 85% was
assumed, yielding a design of 10 HP.

For the 3-stage reflux compressor with interstage cooling, a Ty of
245°K was used for all three stages. The initial pressure is 1.5 atm and
interstage pressures of 5.5 and 9.5 atm were used in applying the above
equation which yields W, = 1.51 kcal/mole. For a reflux ratio of 5 the
power requirement is 54 HP, and with a 20% margin of safety and 85%
efficiency the design is 77 HP.

tion of relative volatility with pressure is introduced according to the
curve in Fig. 2. The feed is assumed to be saturated liquid. |

For the cryogenic Hp distillation the program was modified for the

placed with a constant alpha. The following printout shows the modified
