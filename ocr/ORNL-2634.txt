STATUS OF MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR PROGRAM

PART 1

INTERIM DESIGN OF A POWER REACTOR

1. INTRODUCTION AND CONCLUSIONS

Thé general usefulness of & fluid fueled reactor that can operate
at high temperatures with low pressures has teeﬁ recognized for a long
time. 'Therapplication'of the'molten salts to such a reactor system has
been discussed,l and the operation of the Aircraft Reactor Ex.periment2
demonstrated the basic feasibility of the system. Preliminary design
studies indicated that power reactors based on such systems would be
economicaiiy attractive. This study gives.a more detailed conceptual

~design and outlines operational procedures so that the problems of

handling a moiten-salt power reactor can be better visualized.
Particular attention has been given to the circulating-fuel system,
since this system and its associated equipment will be the heart of any

,molten-salt reactor plant. of perhaps lesser importance are the particular

reactor chosen for study (a_tﬁdéregion'homogeneous converter) and the par-
ticular heat transfer system (tﬁo sodium circuits in series). Alchough
later studies may indicate better ‘choices for the reactor and the heat
transfer system, those selected for this study are considered to be sound
and- to provide 8 good baS1s for estimating the cost of power from & molten-

: salt reactor._ -

The reactor power station chosen for study has a gross electrical

capacity of 275 Mw and a net capacity of 260 Mw. Figure 1.1l shows an

isometric drawing of the principal portion of reactor plant, and the
most important of the reactor"statistics-arg'p:esented in Table 1l.1l.

It is estimated that this molten-salt reactor power station could be

built for 70 million dollars. At 4% per year interest and an 80% load
factor, the fiXed chargesj'including'fueleinventory rental, would amount
0 5.7 mills/kwh. Fuel and salt replacement costs of 1.7 ﬁills/kwh and
an operation and.malntenance charge of 1.5 mllls/kmh (1ncluding chemical
plant operation) lead to a total estimated pover cost of 8.9 mills/kwh.

‘The indicated power ‘cost must be considered-together with the state
of the technology of mblten'salts,‘of alloys for containingrthém, and of
engineering art for de31gn and construction of & reactor 1n order to
determine the emphasis that should be placed on gtudies of the system
in the future. Summaries of the current state of the technology of the
galts, metals, and components are'given in other parts of this report.
The fact of adequate solubility of uranium and thorium in the molten
salts and the strong position that is developing with respect to con-
tainment of the salts are characteristics that make the molfen_salt 8YyS=
tem unique among fluid-fuel systems. Although the materials studies are
not complete, the early results are so encoursging that plans should be

made now for the continued development of the molten-galt system.

The program visualized calls for carrying out the conceptual design
of an expefimental reactor during the fiscal year 1959 so that detailed
design could be started by July 1, 1959. The experimental reactor would
be designed to test typical comstructlon, operation, and maintenance
features of a large power reactor and could be completed by July 1, 1962.
After a'two-year operationai period, a very sound basis would exist for
decidlng whether or not to build large molten-salt power reactors. In
this proposed program, it should be noted that a substantlal part of the
materials compatibility program.would be complete before the major expendi=-

tures for an experimental reactor were made.

2, GENERAL FEATURES OF THE REACTOR

The ultimate -power reactor of the molten-salt.type will probably
have & grephite moderetor, since & high breeding ratio is & mejor aim.
In order to obtain & breeding ratio as high as 1.0, it will be necessary
for the graphite to be in direct contect with the salt and with the nickel
- alloy «:cnrl:aa.:!.ner.3 Although it now seems probeble that graphite will be
| satisfactory for use in contact with the molten salt (see Part 3), the
‘technology is not considered to be far enough advanced to propose such a
-system for the initial reector. This considera.tion led to the specifica-
- tion of a homogeneous molten-salt reactor for this design sttjdy. |

A number of molten fluoride salts that are suiteble for & reactor
fuel are described in Part 2. The base salt chosen for the fuel solvent '
is 8 mixture of L:lTF and Be]‘2 in the mole ratio 62 to 37, respectively.
The Li7 and Be base salts iw.ve the moet desirable nuclesr properties of .
any of the possible salt cﬁtions. Beryllium, in addition to having &

low neutron s,bsorption cross section, sadds appreciably to the slowing- .
down power of the fluorime in the galt. Lithium-7 has the: lowest cross
section of the alkali fluorides. The exact percentages in the mixture
were determined &s & compromise of two physicel properties: the melting
point and the viscasity. The melting point increases &s the L1 content
increases, but the viscosity correspondingly decreases. The fuél mixture
is prepared by edding to the base salt small emounts of ThE), ahd‘"EUFu, the
ThFu being added to provide some regeneration of fissionable ‘materisl

in the core end the UF, being added to made the .reactor criticel. The
critical mixture cealculated for initia.l fueling of the proposed reector
hes the composition 61.8 mole %:1i Tp-36.9 mole % BeF,~1.0 mole % ThE), -
0. 3 mole % UF,+, with the u:ra.nium 93% enriched with lf?3 5

Aircraft Reactor Experiment,” Fuc. Sci. and Eng. » 2 826-8110 (1957)

 
 

 

 

The selection of an 8-ft-dia core for this study was based primarily

~ on the criterion of critical inventory as indicated by nuclear calcula=-
itions covering core diameters of 5 to 10 ft. (Details of the nuclear
calculations are given in Part 4). The initial critical inventory for
S a U235 fueled reactor could be as low as 100 kg, which corresponds to
- & critical mass of about 50 kg. In actual practice, however, thorium
(that is, 1 mole % THF)) is added to the fuel to improve the Tegeneration
 ratio and thus reduce fuel costs, and the resulting initial critical in=-
~ ventory is about 600 kg. With thorium in the fuel, the 8-ft core is a
» feasonable choice that yields a good conversion ratio for a given invest-
_“menta Further, the 8-ft core provides sufficient volume for the average
.nower density in the core to be less than 100 w/cm3, which is well within

safe limits.' The gamms heaeting in the thicker parts of the core shell

~was also taken into consideration, and it was estimated that with the

8-ft core the heating in the core shell‘would amount to 12 w/cm.; which
is not expected to create significant thermal stresses.,

. It was decided that it would be worthwhile to include a blanket in
this reactor'system, despite the fairly high neutron absorption of the

core shell material, since the blanket would add between 0.2 and 0.3 to
the regeneration ratio and the increased saving in fuel cosis would amount

to about.$l,000,000 per year. Although the blanket adds some complications
to the reactor vessel, it offers compensations such as serving as a ther=
mal shield and as a convenient coolant for the fuel-expansion-tank dome,
which is subject to rather severe’ beta heating by the off-gas. The 2-ft-

, 'thick blanket Will allow less than 2% of the neutrons leaking from the
1»core to- pass through it without capture,_ The salt mixture Li7F-BeF —ThFu
| li"was chosen for the blanket and its composition vas selected as that which.
‘I_‘would give the highest ThFu content consistent with a melting point at
~ least 100°F below ‘the. lowest temperature expected in the blanket region.
ﬂiThis specification led to the composition 71 mole % LiF, 16 mole % BeFp,
*13 mole % ThFh, which has a melting point of 980°F More recent chemical
data indicate that up to about 16 mole % THF), can be used'without in-

creasing this melting point°

 
 

 

 

 

 An alloy with the nominal composition 17 wt % Mo, 7 wt % Cr, 5wt % o
Fe, and TL wt % Ni, which is designated INOR-8, wes chosen as the struc-

‘tural material for all components of the reactor that will be in contact s
with molten salts. Details of the characteristics and fabricability of
.this alloy are presented in Part 3.

v}

- .The ehoice of the power level of this design study was arbitrary,
;since.the 8ft resctor core is capable of operation at power levels of
u§5£0_1900 Mw (thermel) without exceeding safe power densities. An
eleeﬁrical generator of 275 Mw capacity was‘chosen, since this is in
| theieiie range that & number of power companies have used in recent years;
‘and & plent of this size could be justified in almost any section of the
United States. It is estimated that about 6% of the power would be used
in the etation, and thus the net power to the system would be about 260 Mw.

 

'Two sodium circuits in series were chosen as the heat transfer system
between the fuel salt and the steamn. Delayed neutrons from the circulating
fuel will activate the primary heat exchanger and the sodium passing
through it. A secondary heat exchanger system in which the heat will ‘
transfer from the radioactive sodium to nonradiocactive sodium will serve
- to prevenﬁ contamination of the steam generators, superheaters, and re-
heaters. A non-fuel-bearing molten fluoride salt is a possible alternate
choice for the radicactive intermediate coolant and has some advantage
~in that it is compatible with the fuel. In the design ‘adopted no dsnger
is expected to arise from mixing of the fuel salt and sodium, however,

and Therefore the cheaper sodium system is preferred.

| The fuel flow from the core is divided among four circults, so that
there are four primary heat exchengers to take care of the core heat
generation. This number of hest exchangers was based on maximum size Vs
thermal-strain considerations. Each of the four parallel heat tranefer
circuits originating in the fuel system trensfers the heat through two
sodium circuits to the steam generators. A similar single circuit is o 2
| providedete'rembve the heet generated in the blanket. |
 

 

 

 

Other 1inkages between the fuel and steam thst have been proposed
are a saltato mercury-vapor system and a salt-to-helium ges system.
The 1atter system is currently being studied. '

‘A plan view of the reactor plant 1ayout is presented in Flgure 1.2,
and an elevation viev is shown in Figure 1.3. The reactor and the pri-
mary heat exchangers are contained in a large rectangular reactor cell,
which is sealed to provide double contéinment for any leakage of fission
gases'and in which all operations must be cerried'out remotely after the
reactor has operated st poser. The primary heat exchangers are laid out

-0 provide an ineline heat exchange system. The rectangular configura-

tion of the plant permits the grouping of similar equipment with a mini-
mm of floor space and piping. The primary sodium circuits are thus
located in ome bay under a crane, and in the next bay'are the secondary
sodium circuits, the steam generators, superheaters, and reheaters under
'another crane. The plant includes, in addition to the reactor and heat
excnanger systems and the electrical generation equipment, the control
room,‘chemicsi processing equipment, end the fill-and-drain tanks for

" the liquid systems.

3.  MOLTEN.SALT SYSTEMS

3.1. Fuel and Blenket Circuits

The primary reactor cell, which encloses the fuel and blanket cir-

ﬂ.ycuits, is a rectangular concrete structure 2k £t wide, 68 £t long, and
-:,}_70 ft high._ The walls are msde of - 9-ft-thick barytes concrete to pro-
p;.lvide the biological shield. Steel 1iners on both sides of the concrete
__J_fg:_wall form a buffer zone to ensure that no fission gos that may leak into
p:iithe cell can escape to the atmosphere and thet no air can enter the cell.
 An inert ‘atmosphere is. maintained in the cell at all times so that &
__5?7sma11 fuel leak will not lead to accelerated corrosion. Penetrations
'*a;;for pipes and‘for electrical and instrument lines are sealed on each side

‘of the enclosure, .

Once the reactor has been at power, the radiation level of the
réactor and the fuel and blanket circuits will be so high that it will
not be possible to perform dirgct maintenance operations onlequipment
in these circuits. All equipment that might require replacement by re-
mote means is instelled in the shielded reactor cell. The alternative
of segregating each piece of equipment in a separate enclosure is more
costly in terms of space, shielding, piping, and fuel inventory. An
air lock is provided through which the crane and maintenance equipment
can be brought into the.ceil.

The principal items of equipmént in the reactor cell are the reac-
tor véssel, the fuel and blanket puﬁps, the fuel and blanket heat ex-
changers, heating and insulation equipment, and the reactor cell cooling
system, and, of course, there are many electrical and miscellaneous plumbing
lines. The reactor vessel and the fuel and blanket pumps ére a8 closely
coupled, integrated unit (Figure 1.4) which is suspended from a flange
on the fuel pump barrel. The vessel itself has two regions -~ one for
the fuel and one for the blanket salt. The fuel region consists of the
reactor core surmounted by an expansion chamber, which contains the
single fuel pump. The blanket region surrounds the fuel region and ex-
tends above the expansion chamber, and the blﬁnket salt cools the walls
of the expansion chamber gas space and shields the pump motor.

Four tangential pipes serve as ducts to return fuel into the lower
conical section of the core. The core shell, which should be as thin
as possible in order to reducé neutron absorption end to keep thermal
strains from gamma heating as low as possible, was chosen to be 5/16 in.
thick to provide adequate strength against buckling under conditions of
maximum pressure differential between the blanket and the core regions.

The floor of the expansion chamber is a flat disk, 3/8 in. thick,
which serves as & diaphragm to absorb differential thermal expansion
between the core and the outer shells. During reactor operation, the

temperature difference between the corc and the outer shells will be
small, but during thé preheating and during power transients the dif-
ferehcé may be higher. The diaphragm will safely allow for differ-
entlal expansion corresponding to a temperature difference of 200°F
without undergoing appreclable plastlc strain.

'-The pipe ducts that enter the reactor_tangentially'will impart a
swirling action to the fuel and keep it turbulent near the wall. No
fluid flow patterns have(&et been obtained for a core of the shape il-
1ustrated; and flow tests; when made, may dictate changes in the shape}
The pump‘for circulating the blanket salt is not supported directly on
the reactor vessel, but iS'located.to the side and at a slightly higher
elevaticn,tc give full blanket ccverage of thc”reactor at all times.

The general requirements of pumps for the;fuel and blanket circuits
are-discusscd*in Part 5. This design study is¥based on use of a pump
of the type shown in Figure 5.2 of that section, which has a capacity
of 24,000 gpm. Based on a fuel volume of 530 £43 in the entire circu-

lating'system, the fuel will meske a complete circuit through the reactor, -

piping, and heat exchangers in 10 sec. A 1000-hp motor will be needed
for the fuel pump, and a shaft speed of 700 rpm will be required. As

indicated in Part 5, this pump incorporates advanced features not present

in any'mclten-salt pumps operated to date. Some consideration was given
to the use of multiple pumps, but since a single fuel pump simplifies
the top portion:of the reactor assembly, it was adopted for this study.

The blanket pump will be similar to the fuel pump, but of smaller
capacity. Sincé the heat generation in the blanket will be no more than
10% of the total heat generated, a pump of about 3200-gpm capacity is

requlred.

| Four primary heat exchangers are provided for the fuel circuit so
that each'heat exchanger will be of reasonable sizepl These heat ex=-
changers are designed to have the fuel on the shell side and sodium '__
‘inside the tubes. This arrangement is contrary to that which might

intuitively be proposed because it might be expected that the fuel
volume would be lower if the fuel were inside the tubes. However,

the superior properties of sodium es & heat transfer fluid are not
realized with the sodium on the shell side, and therefore the over-all
system is most compact with the sodium.inside the tubes,

The heat exchangers (Figure 1.l) are of semicircular construction,
which provides for convenient piping to the top and bottom of the re-
actor. The blanket heat exchanger is similar in construction, but it
is scaled-down to be consistent with the smeller heat load. A more

: 7g:librium solubility is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas

In the system .chosen; approximately 3.5% of the fuel flow is mixed
with helium purge gas and spreyed into the reactor expansion tank. The
mixing and spraying provide a 1arge fuel-to-purge-gas interface, which
promotes the estsblishment of equilibrium.fission gas concentrations in'
the fuel. The expansion tenk provides a 1iqu1d gurface area of epproxi-
mately 26 £4° for removal of the entrained purge and fission gas mixture.
The gas removal is effected by the balance between the difference in the
density of the fuel and the gases and the drag of the opposing fuel ve=-
looity.‘ The surface velocity downward in the expansion tank is approxi-
mately 0.07 ft/sec, vhich should screen out all bubbles larger than
0.008 in. in radius. The probability that bubbles of this size will
enter the reactor is reduced by the depth of the expansion tank being
sufficient to'ellow time for small bubbles to coalesce and be removed,

The liquid volume of the fuel expansion tank is approximately Lo ft3
and the gas volume is approximately 35 ft3 With a fuel purge gas,rate
of 5 cfm, approximately 350 kw of beta heating from the decay of the
fission gases and their daughters is deposited in the fuel and on metal
surfaces of the-fuel expansion tank. This 350 kw of heat is partly re-
,moved by the bypass fuel circuit and the balance is transferred through
?the expansion tank walls to the reactor blanket. o

| iThe'mixture of fission gases, decay products, and purge helium
1eaies the expansion:tank through the off-gas line, located in the top
ef the tank, and Joins with a similar stream from the blanket expansion
tank (see Fzgure 1.5). The combined flow is delayed approximately 50 min
in a cooled volume to allow & large fraction of the shorter lived fission
pﬂpducts to decay before entering the cooled carbon beds. The carbon
beds provide a holdup time of approximately 6 days for krypton and much

1oqger for Xenon,

The purge gases, essehtieily free from activity, leave'the carbon
'bed& to'join=the gases from the gas-lubricated bearings of the pumps.
The gases are then compressed and returned to the reactor to repeat the
cycle. Approximetely every four days one of the carbon beds that hes _
been’ 0perating at minus ho F is warmed to expel the Kr85 end other longu_
'11ved fission: products  _ -

" .3. Molten Salt Transfer Eguipmsnt

Ths fuel transfer systems are shovn echematically in Figure 1. 6o
Salt freeze valwes, described 1n Part Dy are used to isolate the indi- -

t-vidusl components in the fuel transfer linee and to isolate the chemical

'plant from the componente. in-the reactor cell. With the exception of
the reaetor dreining operation, which is described below, the 1iqu1d is
transferred from one veessel to enother by differential, gss pressure.

' 'By this means, fuel may be added to or withdrswn from ths reactor during
tpower operation. " '

- The fuel added to the reactor will have 8, high eoncentrstion of
U235Fh, with respect to the process fuel, so that additions to overcome
burnup vill rpquire transfer of only a small volume; sindlsrly, thorium-
 bearing molten salt may be added at any time to the fuel system. The
thorium, in addition to being 8 design constituent of the fuel salt,
~ may be added in amounts requirea to serve es & nuclear poison for ad-
| Justing the mean core temperature.

| When fuel is removed from the reector, it first goes to onhe of the'

withdrawal tanks. These tanks will be sized to serve ‘&8 holdup vessels
from which material mey be later transferred to the chemical blsnt.

The chemical processing plant is considered to be.an integrsl part'offg,'
the reactor complex; however, the chemical processing plsnt’is set apart

from the reesctor, is conteined in separate cells and has & sepsrste con=
trol center. As indicated elsevhere, the fuel-reprocessing cycle assumed

for this report requires an average daily withdrewal end addition of
gbout 2 ft3 of fuel. If a 30-dsy'holdup of fuel is required for cooling
"~ before chemicsl processing, the withdrswal vessels must provide & volume
of 60 ft3 . They will require both & heating and a cooling system simi-

For the main fuel drein circuii, mechanical valves will be placed

~ in series with the freeze valves to establish a stagnant liguid suitable

for freezing. Normally th:ese‘mecha,niéal valves will be left open.

. Draining of the fuel will be accomplished by melting the plug in the freeze
~ line a,nd,_aliowing‘ the fuel to drain by gra.vi'by._ By opening gas _pressgre |
equallization velves, the “liguid in the reactor will flow to. the dré.in tank,
_and the gas in the drain tank will be transferred to the reactor system.

Thus gas will not have to 'be added to, or vented from, the primary system

Two valves are 1ocated. in parallel in the fuel drain line g0 that a spa.re

path will be available in the event of failure or need for repa.irs.

All the liguid transfer lines will be equipped with heaters and
covered with insulatibn so that the system may be held at temperatures

a.bove the fuel melting point. Since the main drain line is at the 'bottom
of the rea.ctor, there will always be fuel in it. This line is kept from

freezing or overheating by use of a circulation bypass, as shown in Fi‘gure
.6; to keep the stagnant portion confined to the freeze valve area. This

'bypass prondes a certainty that the drain line to the freeze valve is

elways at temperature snd open for draining.

The blanket fluid transfer system is essentially the same as the
fuel system. A chemical processing plant will be provided for the blanket
salt, which may serve as & backup capacity for the fuel reprocessing

~ plant..

3.4. EHeating Equipment

The melting points of the process fluids used are all well above
room témperature. It 1s thus necessary to provide a means of heatihg ’
all pipes and equipment- conta'.ining' thege fluids. This will, in general,
be accomplishedj- by providing electric heaters to all pipes and equipﬂent.i
Inside the reactor cell, the heaters are 1ncorp<_>rated in removable 'a_s.- |
semblies that consist of the heaters and the insulation, as shown in
Figure 1.7. Outside the cell, conventional methods of insta.lling heaters

.. and insulation ere used,

345 Auxillary Coollng

Coollng is provided in the reactor cell to remove the. heat lost
through the pipe insulation and the heat generated in the structural
steel pipe and equipment supports by gamms -ray absorption. The heat |
is removed by means of forced gas circulation: through radiator-type |

'-space coolers. A cooling medium, such as Dowtherm, in a closed loop

rémoves heat from the space coolers and dumps it to a water heat ex-

- changer.

3.6.  Remote Maintenance

Provisions are made to carry out sll maintenance operations in

‘the reactor cell by remote means. While some small repairs may pos-
 sibly be made in the reactor cell, the principal requirement is to be

able to remove and replace by remote means all the necessary components
in the reactor cell. This will include pumps, heat exchangers, pipe, -
heaters for pipe and equipment, instruments, and even the reactor ves-

sel,

A prime requisite for remote maintenance is a reliable method of
making and breaking joints in pipe. This can be done, either by de-
veloping & remote cutting and welding process or by developing a satis=~
factory flanged pipe joint (see Part 5). (The development of a remote
welding process is underway at Westinghouse on the PWR project,)

All equipment and pipe Joints in the reactor cell are laid out so
that thsy;are accessible from above, Directly above the equipment is
a traveling bridge on which can be mounted one or more remotély.opera-
ted manipulators. At the top of the cell is another traveling bridge

for a remotely operated crane. At one end of the cell is an air lock

that connects with the maintenance area., The crane can move from the
bridge in the cell to a monorail in the air lock.

 When 1t hes been ascertained that a piece of equipment ghould be .
: replace&, the reactor will be shut dovm and drained, and the plece of
faulty equipment will be removed according to the following procedure.
The manipulator will be trangported by the crane from the main’bena.nce
erea through the air lock, to the cell, and pleced on the manipuletor
‘bridge. The manipulator will then be used to disconnect all instrue
| men'b, electrical, and service connections from the equipment and to
| unfa.sten the fle.ngee tying the ‘equipment to the system. The crane
will then remove the feulty equipment and tmnsport it to 'bhe meinte-n
nagnce area, The crane will then be used to move & epare 9ieoe of ejquip~
ment 1nto the cell for installation with the use of the ma.nipu]a.toro
After eompletion of the replacement, the manipulator will be removed
from the reactor cell by the crane, the air look will be closed, and
the rea.ctor will be ready for startupo Prelimimry t-ea'bs with & Genersl
Mills manipulstor have demonotruted ‘the fea.sibility of renotely removing
and repla.cing the rotn.tins assembly of e liguid metal pump, It appears
therefore that eat:lsfo,ctory t-chniques can be developed for remote '
‘maintenance.

of equipment with & low probebility of railure, and therefore & spare

~ Maintenance of the intermediate sodium circuits will be done dia_

frectly. In case of an equipment failnre in one of these circuite, the

d so that the addacent cells need not be drained to make a repair.

- ; 7. Fuel Fill-and-Drain Tenk

The main fuel flll-end-drein syetem.mnst neet the following wa Jor

design criterisa: . :
(l) A preheating system must be provided that is capable of main-

taining the drain vessel and its connecting plumbing at 1200°F .

(2) A relisble heat-removal system must be provided that hes euf-‘
ficient capacity to handle the Puel afterheat.

(3) The drain vegsel must be "ever=- safe” so that & criticel cone

jdition cannot occur when the fuel is drained.

The fuel dreining operation has not been considered as an emergency
procedure, that is, one which must be accomplished in a relatively short

~ period of time in order to prevent & catastrophe, There are,. however,_

other 1ncentives for rapid removal of the fluid from the fuel circuit.

- If, for example, there were a leak in the fuel system-it would‘be ine
- portant to'drain the fuel in order to minimize the cell contamination

and cross contaminafion of the systems. Further, rapid removal of the
fuel at the time of & shutdown for me.intenance would have an economic
edwantage in reducing “the power outage time.

e

v

¥

 
 

 

 

-A-cohsideration of these factors indicated that the maximum efter-
heat design load should be 10 Mw for & 600 Mw reactor that had been
operating'for one year and had been shut down for 10 min before the fuel
drain was started, No credit was taken for fission-gas removal during

'.operation, It was further estimated that 15 min would be required to

lremo?e the fuel from the reactor.

For the drain vessel design calculations, it was assumed that at
1200°F the fuel system volume would be 600 ££3. The design capacity of
the drain vessel was therefore set at 750 ft3 in order to allow for
temperature excursions and a residual inventory., An array of 12-in. -
dia pipes was selected as the primary contsinment vessel of the drain
system in erder,to obtain & large surface area-to-volume ratio for heat
transfer efficiency and to provide a large amount of nuclear poison ma-
terial (see Figure 1.8). Forty-eight 20ft lengths of pipe are arranged
in six vertical banks comnected on alternate ends with mitered joints.
The six banks ef pipe are comnected at the bottom with a common drailn
line that comnects with the fuel system. The drain system is preheated
end maintained at the desired temperature with electric heaters instal-
led in smallédiameter pipes;located.exially inside the 12-in.=-dis pipes.
These bayonet-type heaters can be removed or installed from one face of
the pipe array to facilitate maintenance. The entire systen is instal-
led in an iﬁsulated room or furnace to minimize heat losses.

The removel of the fuel afterheat is accomplished by'filling‘boiler
tubes installed between the 12-in.-dia fuel-containing pipes with water

- from headers that are normally filled. The boiler tubes will normally

"be dry and at the ambient temperature of about 950°F Cooling'W111 be
__'°accomplished by slcwly flooding or “quenchlng" the “tubes which furnish
. a heat sink for radiant heat transfer from the fuel-containing pipes

to the boiler tubes.. For the peak afterheat 1oad, about 150 gpm of

 water is required o 'supply the boiler tubes.

Thie fill-end-drein system satisfies the design criteria in that
it 1s always in & etendby condition, in which it 1s immedizstely evailable
for drainage of the fuel, it:can sdequstely handle the fuel afterhest,
end it provides double contaimment of the fuel. Heat removel is essen-
tially self-regulating in that the emount of hest removed 1s determined
by the rediant exchange between the vessels and water wall, Both the
water and the fuel systems eaxe et low pressure , and & double fallure
would be required for the two fluids to be mixed, The drein system temk
may be ee.sﬂy enclosed and sealed from the astmosphere because there are
no large ga.s-cooling ducts or cother major external systems connected to
it. A steinless steel trey will be placed below each benk of pi;pes to
catch the fuel 1if a leek develops. These treys will be cooled by water .
walls to prevent any possibility of meltdown and destruction of the cell.

A prelimina.ry eriticality caleulation wes mede in a drain tank as-
sembly without cooling walls, A multiplication constant of 0.2 was esti-
mated for a fuel containing 0.5 mole % ThFh_ and 0,125 mole % UF), at a
temperature of 125005‘.

4. EHEAT TRANSFER SYSTEMS

fluld to transfer heat from the fuel ’co the steam system, The latter

heaters, A diagrem of -bhe heat removal 15 shmm :Ln Fig. 1.9. A speci-

Each primary sodiuwm circult includes & primery heet exchanger in
the reactor cell and a pump and & secondery heat ext:hanger located in a
cell adjacent to the reactor cell. No control of flow ratee is required,
so there are no valves, and constent=-speed centrifugal pumps ere used.
With a \pmnp‘ stopped, thermal-convection flow would be avaeilable to remove
afterheat from the reactor. The secondary heat exchangers are of the
U=tube in U-shell, counterflow design, with the sodium of the primary
eircuit in the tubes and the sodium of the secondary circuit surrounding
the tubes. In order for the sodium to be at a lower pressﬁre‘ than that
of the fuel in the primary heat exchengers, the pumps for the primarj |
sodium circuits are on the higher temperature legs of the circuits, The
essentlal characteristics of the various heat exchangers are described
in Table 1.2.

The secondary sodium circuits, except for the secondary heat ex=
changers, are outside the shielded area and thus are avallable for ad-
Justment and maintenance &t all times., Three paths are provided for the
sodium flow from a secondary heat exchanger: a steam superheater, a
steam reheater s 8énd & bypass line for control. Regulating va.lves autos
matically adjust the flow to sult the load conditions, so that at very
low loads most of the flow is through the bypass line, |

The three sodium streams are recombined in & mixer or blender, which
leads to & three-way valve. At design point, sbout one-third of the flow
returns directly to the pump suction a.nd two-thirds enters the steam gen-
era.tor a8 the driving streem of a Jet pump The Jet pump, located verti-

A portion of the cooled sodium leaving the steam generator circuit
returns to the pump suction, which is constructed as a blender, end mixes
with the stream bypassed through the three-way velve, The centrifugal
pump is specified as two-speed, with the second speed being one-fourth
of full speed to give essentie.'l.ly one-fourth of the full flow so tha.t
the power output may be more easily regulated from 25% dovn to very low
levels.

The steam genere.tor , Fig. 1.10, consists of tubes suspended in the
flowing sodium. In this Lewis~type boller, the water flows through &
centrel tube to the bottom of each beyonet and boiling occurs during
upwerd flow in the outer emnulus. Baffles in the steam dome separate
the water and steam, and the water returns to & tray which collects it
for recirculation,

Just below the tube sheet and above the godium, & thermal barrier
and & gas space are provided to permit the tube sheet to he at the satu-
retion temperature and thus avoid thermal stresses. In addition, the
gas space will serve &s & cushion for the initial shock in the event &
tube ruptures and water leaks into the sodium.

The superheater 1s a U-tube in & U-shell, counterflow exchenger,
with the steam inside the tubes. As in the steam generator, there 1s a
thermal barrier between the sodium and the tube sheet &t the cold end
in order to minimize thermal stresses. The reheater consists of straight
tubes in a straight shell. With the sodium on the shell side, the tem-
perature difference between the shell and the tubes is sufficiently small
that this more economicel construction can be used. The reheaters are
" located mear the turbine’ to give a small pressure drop in the reheated
steam.

5. TURBINE AND ELECTRIC SYSTEM

Steam is supplied to the 275-Mw-rated turbine at 1800 psie end 1000°F,

The single shaft of the turbine operates at 3600 ¥pm; there are three
exhaust ends, The turbine heat rate is estimated to be 7700 Btu/kwh

| for & cycle efficlency of 44,3%. The electrical genera.tor end station

heet retes eve, respectively, 7860 and 8360 Btu/kwh. With 6% of the
electrical generator output used for station power, the supply to the
bus ber is 260 Mv. These estimates are baged on Tennegsee Vs.lléy
Authority heat belances for & turbine of this type ,6 with athstnients

- mede for the modified steam conditions' end the different plent require-

ments of the molten-salt resctor system.

The condj.tions given above were selected to give the minimnn cost.
Increased cycle efficiency could be obta.ined with higher tanpera.tures

- end, higher Pressures, but the ilncrease in efficiency would be offset by

the :anrea.ses in equipnen‘b costs associa.ted with the higher temperatures
and pressures.

6. NUCLEAR PERFORMANCE

The nuélea.r behavior of the particular molten—sait reactor and fuel
processing cycle selected for this design study is presented in this
gection. (A more detalled parametric study of the nuclear performence of

. molten~salt reactors is givén in Part 4.) The reactor could utilize either

0233 or 1123 2 but, since U2 55 'is the only isotope presently available in

A qua.ntity, it was selected as the primary fuel, For comparison with other

reactors designed to use 023 5 8s a fuel, the performsnce of molten-sal'b
reactors fueled with *>7 is given in Part k.

Plant, Gallatin, Tennessee.

Fbr the nuclear ana.‘l.ysis , the rea.ctor was conceptuslly resolve& into
& spherical core having & wniform temperature of 1180°F, a thin epherical
aore shell of INOR~8, & spherical snnulus of blanket fluid, snd & spheri-
cal reactor shell, A blanket thickness of 2 4t appeared to be sufficient
%0 prevent excessive losses of neutrons to the outside » énd a core vessel

‘thickness of 1/3 in, wvas used. A reactor shell thickness of 2/3 in, was

selected for the calcula.tions, but, in meny cases, the reactor shell was
neglected in order to shorten the calculetions.

The remaining independent va.z'-ia.bles of significence were the concen-
tretion of thorium in the fuel salt, the diameter of the corg, and the
fuel salt reprocessing rate. Of prineipal interest were the oorresponding

eriticel inventories of 02 5 and 02 35 end the regeneration ratio, In

Pexrt 4, the results of & paremetric study of the initial states are pre-
sentedj that is, the results are for "cleen" reactors, having no fission
fregments or nonfissionsble 1sotopes of uranium other than 02 38 present,
However, the optimum system could not be determined from such & study
alone; in pexrticular, the time efter startup when proceseing is initiated,
the method of processing, end the rate are important factors. The para-
metric study of various fuel reprocessing schemes that is under way at
present is deseribed in Part 4., This study 1s not yet complete bece.use '
the number of possible combinations of irdependent variables is quite
lerge. Therefore, a typleal get of cornditions, vhich may turn out to

be nearly optimum, was selec'bed for ;presen'bation.

A core diameter of 8 £t end a ’bhorim concentration of 1.0 mole g4
in the ruel eelt were select.ed a.s & reasoneble compromise between the

~ desire to minimize the - inventory oi‘ u2 35 a.nd to- maximize the regenera.-

tion ratio, The nuclear perfomance of the initia.l sta.te is set fourth

in T&ble l-5¢ .

A oonvereion ratio of 0 63 ie believed to be a.bout the maximmn tha.t

can be obtained in a. homogeneous molten rluoride sa.lt system with U255

es the fuel (see Part 4).  The perfoma.nce with Ue 35 would be subetan-

‘ tial]y ‘oetter, of course ’ a.nd regeneration ratios of 0.90 or higher could

be obtained in the clean reactors. Further, as discussed in Section 2
above, the use of graphite to moderate the fluoride regctor may result -
in substantisl improvement.

The neutron balance is presented in terms of neutrons ebsorbed in
each element per neutron shsorbed in U235 Thus the sﬁm of the abéorp- |
tions in thorium end U2 give, directly, the regeneration ratio, end
the sum of all the ebsorptions givesM, the number of neutrons produced
by fission per neutron absorbed in U255 An examination of Table 1.3
shows that sbout one-third of the regeneration tekes place in the blenket.
The single, most importent loss of neutrone is to radia$ive capture in
U255; if other parasitic captures and leaskages could be reduced to zero,
the regeneration ratio would still be limited to 0.80 in this reactor
by rediative capture in 122, fhe other importent losses are to carrier
galt in the core and to the core vessel, which reduce the regeneration
ratio by 0.10 and 0.05, respectively. Losses to the blanket salt and to
leskage smount to less than 0,02 neutrons. | “

Of the neutrons lost to the carrier salt, the majority are captured
by fluorine, and the loss is unavoldable. The lithium is specified to A
be 99,99% L173 end the 116 content is estimated to be about equal to that
which would be in eguilibrium with the n- reaction in beryllium. Hence,
there is no point in specifying & lower concentration of I&sa The system
contains nearly 10,000 kg of purified Li7, Of the neutrons lost to the
core vessel, about ohe-third ere captured by the molybdemum; nickel cap~
tures account for mpst of the ramaining loss. Increasing the hardness
of the neutron spectruﬁ by increasing the thorium concentration tends to

decrease the absq;ptidhs in the carrier salt and in the core vessel, but .

this decrease 1s ‘moré than offset by the decline in N of U255 at higher:'
energies. |

The accumulation of fission fragments end nonfissionable uranium
isotopes tends to increase the inventory of U255 and to depress the re=-
generation ratio. Ehe production of U255 tends to ‘counteract these L

effects, N6verthe1ess, if the fission products are not removed, the

ﬁBTu

 
 

 

 

inventory of U-2? will increase repldly £ram 600 to 900 kg during the
first year of operation. The regeneration ratio will fall from 0.65 to
0.53 in the same period. About TO kg of 023 > will have accumulsted, of
which 85% will be in the fuel salt.

The nuclear characteristice of the system et the end of the first
year are presented in Teble L.k. As mey be seen, the increesing hardness
of the neutron spectrmn results in a decrease of losses of neutrons to
the fuel salt and to the core vesssl to O. 012, but this sa,ving is more
than offset by the corresponding decline in M to 1,78 (a.veraged over
all three fissionable :Lsotopes present). |

If the fission products were ellowed to &cemmzlate further, the
'5123 2 inventory would contlnue to rise. If, hawever, the fuel salt is
reprocessed continuously at the rate of one fuel volume per year {thus
holding the fission product concentretion constent), the 025 2 inventory
and regeneration ratio can be held stationary, as shown in Part L, Fig.
4,10, The continual incresse in the concentrations of nonfissioneble
uranium isetopes is compensated by the accumulation of 623 3. A neutron
balance for the system at the end of twenty years is giveri in Teble 1.5. |

As may be seen, 0256 is much more harmful than 0238 s 8ince it cap~

. tures 2.5 times as many neutrons and doez not form & fissionable isctope.

Despite these losses, however, the regeneration ratio does not decrease
appreciably, mainly because of the superior properties of 0233 s Wwhich
provides 4§0% of the fissions.

In sxmnary, once reproeessing t0 remove fission products 1is ‘begun,
nuclear performance of the gystem is stabilized to a satisfactory degree
for twenty years.‘ No provision for the rexhova]_. of the nonfissionable
isotopes of uranium need be made. | |

If desired, the trensients during the first year of operation cen’
be largely eliminsted by allowing the thcriinn congentration to decrease,
rartly through burnup end partly through withdrawal. Such & case is |
shown in Fig. 4.10 as a dashed line, in which the core reprocessing 1s

 begun immedistely and the thori\m is removed at the rate of 1/900 per

day, in addition to the normal burnout at the rate of 1/4300 per day.

The critical inventory rises within one month to & maximm of 626 kg and
then falls to 590 kg at the end of eight months. At this time the re-
processing rate is increased to 1/560 ver day, end the thorium is returned
to the core. Thus, the thorivm concentration falls thereafter only by
burnout. The regeneration retio ie little different from that of the
previous case during the first two yeers, as indiceted by the dashed line ’
but it falls steadlly thereafter. The 112 3 inventory rises slowly » but
the UE5 5 inventory 1s stebllized at 200 kg after about six years. The
025 > inventory could have been stebilized &t the twe-year value by modest
withdrewals of thorium; however, the regeneration ratio would have fallen
faster and additions of U23 2 to compensate for burnup would have been
greater.

A necessary condition for the feasibility of a molten-salt reactor
1s the integrity of the core vessel. This member is exposed to high-
Intensity neutron and gama fields 'y end it is therefore subject to both

. radiation damage and thermal stress. With a preliminary estimate of the

hea.ting in a comparsble reactor having a pure nickel core vessela as a
basis and with ellowence made for such differences as diemeter snd com-
position of the fuel salt, the combined gamma and neutron heating in an
8-ft~die INOR-8 core vessel in a reactor heving 0.5 mole % ThF), in the

- Tuel salt and operating et & power level of 600 Mw of heat was estimated

to be not greatexr than 12 w/ m’ -of metal. The rate of heat relesase in

the 'blanket sa.lt was es’cimated te e not gree.ter than 50 Mw, exclusive
‘ ’of any contribution from fissions in the blanket » vhich may add up to

T. FPROCEDURE FOR PLANT STARTUP

The initisl startup of the plent will be accomplished in four steps:

(1)‘ prelimina.ry. checking of the systems, (2)_,prehea'_ting end £1lling of
~ the fluid circuits, (3) enriching to criticality, emd (4) operating et

lowpower. The integ'ity and proper functioning of the equipment will

be esta.blished insofar es possible, in the preliminary checking of the
system, This step will include, in addition to cleaning and leek testing,
checks of instrument snd alerm equipment settings end functloning, con-
tinuity and polerity of the electrical circuits ’ direction of rotation

of rotary élements , and opera.tion of vaelves and auxilia.:y gystems,

In the second step, the fuel, blanket salt, and sodium circuits
will be preheated to eabove the melting points of the various mediums

~and then filled. The preheating loads will be divided into menageable

sections that can be sutomatically monitored for hot and cold spots o0
thet thermal stresgses may be minimized. The systems will be filled at
temperatures as low as practical so that full advantage can be teken of
fluid circulation as & means of bringing the system to an isothermal con~
dition before enrichment. During the initial period of fluld circuletion
to establish the isothermal condition, the proper functioning of the flow
control equipment will be established. Also the cleanliness end metal-
lurglcal stability of the contaimment system will be evaluated by analyzing
samples withdrawn from the fluld systems. The operability of the fuel
system withdrawing and enriching equipment will be checked with barren .
salt; the high-temperature instrumentation will be checked; the draeining
and refilling procedures will be verified by testing; and remote mainten-
ance techniques will be tried out. This period of nonnuclear isothermsl
opera.tion at high temperature will also serve to familiarize the operating

 crews with the system and to establish their confidence in its operability.

The preheating and fillihg procedures will begin with the introq.uc-
tion of water to the steam generastors. The steem genmerators and the
gsodium systems will then be preheated to 350°F, which will produce &

pressure of 150 psi in the steam system, The éodim will then be pres-
purized from the sodium drain tenks into the primery end secondary sodium
systems, the sodium pumps will be started, and flow will be established.
Both sodium systems will thé_n be further heated to 600°F by using the
electric heaters end by making use of the fluid circulstion. Simulta-
neously the fuel and blenket circuits will be heated with electric heaters
to the same temperature. The pressure in the steam generators will have
risen to approximately 1800 psi end, before further system heating is
ettempted, & small loed will be imposed on the steanm generators to hold

the water temperaturé to 600°F as the rest of the circults are hested to
bigher temperatures. The steam genera.tors‘ will be loaded by bypassing

a small steam flow around the turbine, This load will be detexmined by

the smount of :éxcess power avé.ilable during the heatirig period from pumping
power end externsl heat sources in the systems. The load will be low |
relative to the design cepacity of the steem generators; there will probably.
‘be less than 1 Mw available for bypess steam 'generation in the five units.

At this jJuncture any increase in water temperature (above 600°F)
would result in overpressurization of the steem system, and if the steam
generators were allowed to evaporate to dryness end go to higher tempera-
tures, severe thermsl shocks would be imposed on the structures. when
water was again introduced. Theréfore, the sodium flow to the steam
generators will be reduced as the reactor systems »a.re elevated in tem-

: pera.ture. The flow in the secondary sodium loops will be reduced by

| lcwering the pump speed, wh:l.ch in turn will reduce the flow to the steam

At this time &ll the 'réa.cf.o;c ‘heat transfer loops will have been filled,

erators will be running &t temperatures less than 625°F, and the super- .
heater end reheater sodium éiré.uits_ will be running et temperatures less
thsn 1100°F but greater than 625°F. The heat that is trensferred through
the systems by virtue of the 475°F gredient will be durqped in the steem
bypassing the turbine. This heet loed nmay. ve ira.riegi by éhanging the rate
. of dumping of the stéem and the sodium flow rate in the steem generstors.

When 1t hes been established that the plant is performing Se.tisf_a.q?- ;
torily and that the systems are tight and chemically cleen, the cfitical
experiment will be started. Fuel concentrate will be added to the resctor
'through the enrichment system. Approximately 38 ft3 of LiF-BeFE-UFu mixe
ture cénta.ining 2.5 mole % UF), will have to be added to the 530 £ of
carrier salt to achieve & fuel concentration of 0.15 mole % UF), » As the
concentrate is added, 1t may be necessary to withdraw fluid from the fuel #
system so that an adequate expension volume will be availsble in the | '
expansion tenk. The reactor will be titrated to criticality at llOOo‘F,"
and after criticality has been a.chievéd, & thorium~enriched salt will be
added to the fuel mixture. This will drive the temperature down, end
the oyerating temperature msy be finally trimmed by alternste additions
of fuel end thorium concentrate mixtures. By edding the thorium to the

- system as a last step, 1ts worth as e poison or chemical temperg‘.ture' sliim

A period of low power operation will fallow the criticality experi-
ment. By virtue of the negative temperature coefficient, the reactor
will be a slave to the demand loa.d; which will be imposed by _increa.s,ing" _'
the steam generation rate as & resulf of increasing the rate of sodium
flow through the steem system. Manuel memipulation of system comtrol -
velves will be required ;mt:!.l an epprecisble fraction of design power B
is obtained, sey, 30%. The rate at which the load may be incressed will
be determined bir the permissiblé rete of temperature change of the com-

The turbine will be preheated by admitting steam thmugh ‘bhe turbine

speed, all the stemm will be directed 'bhreugh its normal path. At low
.power levels, it may be necessary to attemper the stesm so thet the tur-
bine temperature limits will not be exceeded

Normal plent resterts aefter power operation will follow the same
basic procedures, except that no criticael experiment will he required.
Since there 1s no control rod, close attention will have to be paid to
the fuel system filling rate and temperature so that nuclear trensients
will not be incurred.

8., RBEACTOR CONTROL AND REFUELING

The kinetics of circulating fuel reactors have been studied and
reported in a number of papers.9 A typicel velue for the temperature
coefficlent of reactivity for & molten-saelt reactor is «k x 10™7 (Ak/k)/o F.
This negative temperature coefficlent is sufficient to make the power
level in the reactor a slave to the applied load for all pormal. \ope‘re.-
tional power demand changes, without the use of control rods, As indi-
cated in the following section (Sec. 9), 1t keeps the reactor gafe from
excessive temperature excursions even under some rather a.dverse conditions.

1s neglected in this calculation. In the flrst year of operation, the
increased inventory required to compensate for the poilsons requires more
frequent fuel additions. The calculation described gbove is typical cf
the conditions that exist after fuel reprocessing is initiated.

9.3; " An Instantaneous Reduction of the Heat Flow Rate from the ﬁeactor Core

If,a,fuel pﬁmp should suddenly stop, the rate of heat removal from the
core would be quickly reduced to a fraction of that at\full power. The heat
removedfwouldfbe determined by thermal insulation iosses, byvthermal convec-
tion through the core fuel circuits, and by heat transfer to the blanket
~through the core vessel wall. The latter would be very significent if the
blanket pump remeined operative. During the first few seconds following &
~ sudden fuel pump faillure, forced circulation in the cbre circuits would per-

- gist és a resﬁlf of inertial effects but at a rapidly declining rate. The
sharply decreased circulation rate would result in a iarger fraction of the

delayed neutrons being reléased in the reactor core.

A limiting apprOXimationkof the effects of fuel ?ump stopping was studied
on the simulator. In the simulator studies, 1t was postulated that during
steady-state full-power operation, the heat removal was reduced instantaneously
to a small fraction of full power. It was further postulated that the flow of
fuel stopped instantaneously so that the fuel salt that was in the reactor
stayed there. The peak‘femﬁeratures which could be achieved if these condi-
tions could be met and the times to reach them are given in Fig. 1l.13 as
functions of the reduced heat removal rate. The temperature rise indicated
results from the continued fission power generation at subcritical conditions
from the gradual decay rate for the neutron flux end does not take into account
afterheat from fission product radioactive decay, which acts as an additional

heat source.

Thé curves in Fig. 1.13 should be used with caution; they are intended

" only to set upper limits on ﬁhe temperature rise. The coasting effect from
the fuel's inertia and thermal-convection circulation will reduce the peak
temperatures markedly, but the relationships are complex and a more extended
analysis is necessary. The pesk temperatures are not a problem of themselves,
but their sudden appearance will cause thermal strains. The magnitudes'of
these strains and their effects on the integrity of the reactor requires

analysis, but no serious consequences are expected.

9.k Cold Fuel Slugging |

If cold fuel is suddenly injected into the reactor eore when the

~ power level is very 1ow, the core may'become supercritieal on & fast

before the mean eore temperature rises again to ite nermal operating

One case eensidered involved suddenly 1ncreasing the power demand

at the beiler from 6 Mw to 600 Mw. The immediete effect is to 1ewer the N

core Inlet temperature to about 1000 F. The ayerage aore temperature 1s |
reduced'te ebeut 1050 F, The tempeneturee then rise asymptoticelly to

perceptible overshoot. It is concluded that a fuel pump starting up
with cold fuel in the primary heat exchangers is unlikely to lead to
high temperature excursions in the reactor.

- 9. S. Rem0va1-of Afte;'heat by Thermal Convection

 

A survey 'éxamiﬁation of the capability of ‘the heat transfer system
for the removal of heat by thermal convection in the event that all

| pumping power is lost has been made, The temperature pattern of the

system reéluired for the removal of 4% of the design power by thexmal .

- convection is shown in 'Fig..‘ 1.14, This study shows in a preliminary way
- that thermal convection can remove enough heat from the reactor core so

that loss of power to the pumps in the redioactive areas will not neces-

 sitate the drainege of the fuel from the reacétor. A detalled system

enslysis may indicate thet slight modifications in leyout mey b: required
to accomplish this, however. |

of the fuel salt. The steam system is such a large, relatively low teme

will generate fission heat automatically. In order to maintain the power
station:in a standby condition during a period in which, say, the elec-
tric generator equipment is inoperative and there is a simulteneous loss
of pover to the plant, emergency power generation equipment will be
needed. The emergency supply must have sufficlent capacity to operate
instruments, controls, feedwater punps end auxiliary equipment necessary
for control end removal of afterheat.

9.8, -leak Between Fuel and Blanket Salts

~ The free surface of the blanket salt 1is above the free surfece of
the fuel salt, and the blanket selt is more dense than the fuel salt,
Both the core and the blanket will have e common ges pressure over them, .
and both are on thejsucﬁion'side of'the:pumps in their respective systems.
_,Under these conditions the blanket will always be at & higher static pres-
:sure than the’ core, and any 1eak between the fuel end blanket salts will
| drive the blanket salt into the fuel salt and lower the critical temperan

.ture of the reactor core. gj<

With such a leak ﬁhe maintenance of ayatem.tem@eratures would re-
quire addition of fuel at a-rate in excess of that required for burnup
end’ fission product poisoning.. To mainxein the critical temperature |

that lesk into ‘hl*e core from the blenket. Thus, 1f the fuel accounta-
bility is sufficiyently sensitive to detect a 10% excess fueling rate,
inleskage to the core of more then 165 cm? per day will be detected.

The fuel end blanlcet salts are chemically inert with respect to each -
other, and therefore no chemical effects of the mixing are ex_pected. |
if fission-product and heavy-element poisoning were to mask 'bhe excess
refueling caused by a blanket leak and prevent early detection, the lesk
would be detected eventual]y by cerresponding chenges in fuel end blanket
inventories s 85 indicated by the level ind.:l.cators of the respective
systems.

~ Once a lesk between the core and blanket was detected, the reactor
would be shut down and all liquid systems would be .drained. Replacement
" of the reactor vessel would be required, and this would be & 1engbhy

operation,

Complete rupture of the core vessel would lead e.utomatica:l.]y to &
suberitical cOndition. The core surge tank would £111 as the bls.nket
end core pressures tended to equalize.

9.9. Ieak Between Fuel and Sodium

The relative pressures in the fuel and sodium systems will always
be such that, in the event of a leak between the fuel and the sodium,
the fuel will enter the sodium stream. This errengement is used because |
the consequences of precipitation of urenium in the cir’cula.ﬁing fuel
system cannot be predicted with certainty.

The chemical cbnsequences of a leek of the fuel into sodium, such
as could occur in a primary hest excha.nger, have been examined on the
basis of thermodynamic data.la When the fuel is mixed with excess sodium,
the major constituents, except IiF, will be promptly and simultemeously -
réduced to their metallic states, according to the reactions:

Of the fission products contained in the fuel, the alkaline earths, the
rare earths, end a considerable fraction of the alkali metals will remain
in the salt phase as fluorides, while Mo, Ru, Zr, cd, Zn, Sb and Sn will
be reduced to the metallic state.

The anions, particularly I]'5 T and Br87, which are important for
neutron detection because they are long-lived precursors of deleyed neu-.
tron emitters, will appear es halide ions. Accordingly, the salt mixture »
after reaction, will contain about 5% mole % NaF, 46 mole % IiF, and traces
(insofar as concentration is concerned) of fission product fluorides.
Such & mixture will have a melting point greater, probably, then 700 C.
(1300°F) » and accordingly will be solid at the normal temperatures in the
sodium circuilt.

- Metals such as Sn, Sb, Cd, Rb, Cs, and Zn should be soluble in molten
sodium, but all other materials introduced into the sodium by ﬁhe fuel
are moderately high melting and will be sparingly soluble in the sodium.
Beryllium metal, which is present in relatively large concentrations a.nd

which appears to be relatively insoluble (< 100 ppm) in sodium, will
| probably be the first material precipiteted. - Sodium fluoride probs.bly

dissolves to the extent of 0.2 mole % in sodium at llOOoF, and this selt,
along with LiF, will exceed the solubility :l.n molten sodium and exist

as. separate solid pha.ses after relatively small quan'b:l.ties of fuel have

Sodium iodide and sodium bromide a.re more soluble tha.n sodium fluo-
ride in molten sodium, and these precu:rsors of the delayed neutron enitiers
will, accordingly, be dissolved in the molten sodium until the NaF-LiF
mixture saturates the sodium end forms a seoond phase, - Since they are

more soluble in the salt phase than in the liquid metal' they could, in

, principle » then decrease in concentration in the molten metal due to their

| extraction into the solid salt phase., This extraction process is not

~ expected to be importent, however, since ‘the emount of solid salt phase

- will be small for a considersble.period, end extraction by a solid from
a liquid should be relatively slow. | M'bhemore s precursors of delsyed
neutrons present in the sodium a.rise only from the :t‘reshly leaked-in fuel,
and therefore the concentration of precursors wil_'l. not be appreciably .

_ affected even though the totel atomic: species concentration may be dimin
ished by extractions. '

Prompt detection of small fuel leaks into the primary sodium clr-
cuit poses a problem yet to be solved. Al cm3 /day leak will produce
approximately 0.5 n/ cm e geC by precursor decay at the secondary heat
exchanger, but it is doubtful that neutrons of such a source strength |
can be detected in the sodium cell. Likewise the neutron actiiration of
the primary sodium produces gama;ray activity which would tend to mask
fission fragnenn gamma activity. Detection of large leaks would ‘oe ‘aided
by comparison with the activity in the other similar secondary sodium
circuits, but the determination of the size of lesk that can be detected
has not as yet been mpde. . .

A welleagitated stoichiometric mixture of sodium and fuel salt will
result in & rapid temperature rise, estimated to be 1200°F under -adiabatic
conditions. It is difficult ’ however » for such conditions to ex_isn -in -
a practicel situation. Heat evolved from a small leak would be rapidly
carried away by excess sodium. For the larger leaks which could occur
from fatigue in bending or 'bension, the solids formed would in‘berfere .
with repid mixing. Some work has been done with a NaF-ZrFu base fuel and
NeX which demonstrated this smothering effect; further engineering tests
- 'will ‘be required to demonstrate safety with sodium and the present fuel
- salt in simuleted component equipment.

, ..5_8_..
 

 

 

As soon as & fuel to sodlum leak had been detected and the feulty
heat exchanger had thus been located, the reactor plant would be shut
down, the fuel and appropriate sodium circuits drained, and the heat
exchange:r replaced.

'9.10. _Leak of Fuel or Blamket galt to Reactor Cell

The presence of a small lesk from the fuel to the rebetor cell can
be deﬁected"by gas=sampling techniqﬁes. Its léca:l:ion will be more dif-
ficult to determine, 'The repair of such a leak would of course require
draining the fuel salt. The provision of an inert atmosphere in the
reactor cell will prevent rapid growth of lea.ks ca:used by salt-fluxed
oxidation. ‘

A gross leak or ruptu:re of either the fuel or bla.nke'b circuits is

10. CHEMICAL PROCESSING AND FUEL GYCLE ECONOMECS

10.1. Fuel Salt Reprocessing

 

The system for chemical reprocessing of the fuel salt is e cambina-
tion of the ORNL fluoride volatility and the Kﬁ25 uranium.hexsfluoride
reduction processes. described in Part 6. 'The salt to be reprocessed is /

| transferred as described in Section 3, above, from the reactor circuit
%0 & holdup vessel on & convenient schednle, such as 2 ft3 once eaeh day

or 12 ft3 once each week. The holdup vessels provide containment during

~ the holdup period reqnired for decay of the short-lived activities and

act as a buffer between the reactor end the chemical plant so that the
operation of the reactor need not depend on the state of repair of the
chemical plant.

The fuel salt will be fluorinated in batches of 2 ft3 each, one
batch per day. After the uranium is removed by fluorination and collected
as'UFé on NaF pellet beds, the barren salt is transferred to waste storage.
The UFB'Will be discharged on a twice~per-week cycle from the NaF pellet
beds, which have a capacity of 10 kg of uranium. The volatility process
produces liquid UEB, in cylinders, which is subsequently fed to a reduc~
tion tower to produce UF), which is combined with fresh salt for return
to the reactor. The uranium losses in the chemical processing are sbout
0.1%, i.e., about 1 kg/year.

10.2. Blanket Salt Reprocessing -

Chemical processing of the blanket salt is physically much the same

as the processing of the fuel salt except that, after fluorination, the

salt is returned to the blanket system. Because of the much lower power -
density in the blanket salt, holdup for decay-cooling is not & problem.

~ Separate fluorinators for fuel and blanket salts, to prevent cross-

contemination, are assumed, as are separate NaF beds, to make possible

e the withdrawel of pure 0235 from the system i1f desired. The seme UFB

reduction tower will serve both fuel and blanket salt processing.

- 60 -

 
et b NS i s

 

 

A blanket selt processing rate that is about‘ the same as that for
the fuel selt is assumed, i.e., one 2 ft3 batch per day. Thus fluorina-
tion equipment of the same size will suffice. The uranium throughput

‘rate of the blanket salt processing system is , however, only sbout 10%

of that of the fuel salt. For convenience s the same size of NaF bed is

proposed for the two systems, elthough this meens that the UF; will be

discharged from the NaF bed in the blanket salt system only once every
other month,

The blanket salt processing rate is sufficiently fast to hold the .
U25 5 inventory in the blenket salt system to about 60 kg and to limit the
fissioning in the blanket salt to about 3% of the total.

10.3. Cost Bases

Fissioneble isotopes have been velued at $17/g in computing inven-
tory and burnup charges and breeding end resale credits. Capltalization
rates were assumed to be 4%/yr on fissioneble materials and 14%/yr on
everything else. The fuel salt was estimated to cost :';5].2'78/:13‘1;5 end the -
vlenket salt $2517/ft”, The varisble cost of fuel selt chemical process
sing is assumed to be equal +to the cost of buying new salt to replace
that process'ed.l The blenket salt is used over the life of the reactor
without excessive fisslon product buildup.

The fissionable materiel comsumption cost is based on feeding 93%
enriched 112 3 5 to the -core system to compensate for & regeneration ratio
of less tha.n unity. It is assumed that lf? 35 :Ls not availe.ble for purchese

10.4, Chemical Plant Capital Costs

The budgeted capital costs for the QRNL volatility pilot plant total

about $l,500 000 through fiscal 1959, This figure includes replacements

and.modifications, which should not be required in & second plent, end

1t also includes solid fuel element handling end dissolution facilities,

vhich would not be required in the molten-salt reactor plant. On the

other hand, the $1,300,000 does not include building and service facili-
ties, or any eqpipment for reducing UFg to UFh and, reconstituting fuel

salt. Aﬂditlons and subtractions considered the reference design .
chemical plant equipment and installation cost 1s. estimated to be $l,500 000,
The chemical plant's share of the total reactor capital investment is

_about twice this amount, when charges for bullding end site, design,_general~

expense, and contingencies are added. These capital costs are listed
with other capital costs in Section 11.

10.5. Chemical Plant Operating Costs

The ORNL volatility plant operating budget for three fiscal years
(1957-58-59) totals $1,368,000. The molten-salt reactor chemical plant
would have lower "unusual” costs (associated with development) than the
pilot plant, but higher "production-proportional” coSts, apd 1s estimated
to cost $500,000 per year to operate. To this must be added the cost
of replacing the fuel salt processed, or reclaiming it, if this can be
done for au equal or lesser cost. This is estimated to be 600 ft3 (ap-'
proximately one fuel system volume) per year at $1278 per ft5, a total
of $770,000 per year. A salt reclamation process might be expected to
reduce this considerably, although probably not more than by a factor
of 2, which nevertheless would save sbout 0.2 mills/kwh. The chemical
plant operating costs are listed with other operating costs in Section
11. '

110.6, Net Fuel Cycle Cost

 

For the purpose of estimating fuel cycle costs, values averaged over

the reactor lifetime of 1000 kg for the U253 U235 inventory and 0.5 for

thereffective breeding ratio were assumed. The nuclear heat power was

-62-
 

teken to be 640 My, the net electrical output 260 Mw, and the load factor
0.80. The net fuel cycle cost is estimated to be ebout 2 mills/kwh:

 

Ttem T - mills/kovh
¥ consumed o 2,260,000 S0 1.2k
Fuel salt make@ | 770,000 0.k42
R inventory 680,000 0,37

. 2,03

If‘ & comparison of total fuel cycle costs with thoée for a solid fuel
element power reactor are to be made , the chemical pla.nt capita.l cost
end the chemica.l plant oPerating cost should be added. These amounts
are as follows:

$/yr | mills/kwh
Capital cost ($3,000,000) 420,000 - 0.23
Operating cost | 500,000 0.28

They lead to a total mél cycle 'cost 61’ 2. Sy-mills/kwh.

ORNL's experience in molten~salt and alkali metal heat transfer
equipment fabrication and procurement has been drewn on to estimate the
increased cost in producing reector-quality products.

In some cases individuel ccmponents were found to be too mumerous
for detailed cost analysis in the time availsble, and costs were essigned
to entire suhsystems on the bésis of general experience. The instrumen-

,tetion, electrical equipment and auxiliary systems were treated in this

menner, for exemple. | ' -

It has been assumed that the molten-salt reactor plent would be con-

-structed et a site similar to the one selected in a recent ORNL ges=cooled

reactor study. 3 Therefore, site ecquisition, imprevement, and structure
costs have been set at comperable levels,

 The capital cost summary is presented in Teble 1.6. It should be
noted that a 40% contingency factor has been epplied to the reactor por-
tion of the system. It is felt that there are a'rumber of uncertainties
in some of the larger reactor cost'packeges and a contingency factor of
this order is warranted. A T7.5% contingency factor was applied to the
remainder of the direct costs. |

The general expense or indirect costs charged to the plant represent
administrative, personnel, plant protection, safety and special construc-
tlon services which are largely incurred during comstruction and startup
0peraticns._ The design cost represents approximately 5% of the direct .
cost subtotal before the contingency factors were applied. This capital
cost sumary leads to & cost of $269 per installed killowatt of generating

capacity. | : . ¥

1l.2. Power Costs

Power costs hawé been divided into three categories. These are:
fixed costs, operation and maintenance costs, and fuel cycle costs.
The fixed coste are the cherges resulting from the cepital investment
in the plent, This emount has been set at 144 per annum of the invest-
ment, which includes taxes, insurance, and financing charges. This leads
to an ennuel cherge of $9,776,000 or 5.37 mills/kvh. | -

The operation and maintenance costs are, in the main, dependent on
the ultimate relisbility of the reactor portion of the plant. The de-
velopment of practicel remote-maintenance techniques for the repair and
replacement of equipment in the redioactive systems'is also vitel to
| . assure reasoneble costs. No accurate determination of such costs cen
1 be made without further experience.

 

For the purpose of this report the operation and maintenance cost
breskdown given below has been assumed: | |

Amnugl Charge -

Labor and supervision $ 900,000
Reactor system spare parts |
Pumps 250,000
Heat exchangers ' 200,000
Miscellaneous 300,000
Remote-hendling equipment | 150,000
Chemical plant operation 500,000
Conventional supplies 400,000
| Total $2,700,000

This total cost results in an incremental power cost of 1.48 mills/kwh.
Net fuel cycle costs as discussed in Sec. 10 above amount to 2,03 mills/kwh.

 
 

 

The three categories add up &s follows: -

 

Annusl Cherge - mills/kovh
Fixed cost . $ 9,766,000 537
Operating and meintenance 2,700,000 - 1.48
Fuel charges 3,710,000 2.03
Total annuel charge $16,176,000
Total power cost \ 8.88

The difference in cost between having the :'eactor plent on standby and
heving 1t on the line is about 2 mills/kwh. |

12, SOME ALTERNATES TO THE PROPOSED DESIGN

12.1, Alternate Heat Trensfer Systems

The possibility of replacing the fuel-toésodim-to-sodium-to-steam
heat trensfer system with a fuel-*bo-gas-to-steém ‘sy'stem has been given
a cursory exsmination. The attractiveness of such & system' is based on
the replacement of two sodium systems in series with one gas system and
in heving the gas chemically competible with both the fuel and weter or
steam. Early estimates of the gas heat transfer performence indicate
that the fuel volume required to transfer an equivalent quentity of heat
would not be appreciably different from that requii-ed with the sodium
system. These estimates were based on use of & return gas temperature
below the melting point of the fuel, and the sa.fety of this procedure

" must be examined further. If the gas system were operated in the 300~
to 1!-00-1)51 range, the power required to circulate the gas eould:be.kept.at

a reasonable level. -

The gas system would permit & reduction in the nunber of heat ex-

j cha.ngers a.nd pumps, s.nd eliminate sodium va.lves. The dew point of the

gas would provide & rapid method of leak deteetion in cese of e steam-
to~gas lee.k A steam leak into 'bhe gas system would no-b heve the chemical
hazerd that exists with a steam-to-sodium leak. If the reactor were

- 69 -

 
 

 

 

operated inside a pressure shell, the fuel pressi;re could be maintained
slightly below the gas pressure to ensure that any leeks in the fuel
system would be inwerd. The small pressure differential required between
the fuel and the gas would permit the maximum fuel (gage) pressure to

be maintained at a level no higher than that required by the liquid-cooled
system. ‘

Gas _eooling would eliminate the need for the sodium handling eystems
with their sttendent preheating problems. These sodium facilities would
be replaced with gas storage and hendling equipment, Startup and shute
down procedures would be simpler with ges then with liquid cooling, par-
ticularly with respect to preheating end pert losd control, The amount
of secondary rediation shielding required with the liquid system would.
be considersbly reduced with the gas system because of the decreased in-
duced activity of the coolant. |

More studies of the gas cooling system are being made, and it is
spparent that the bulkiness of the gas system will present handice.ps; .
It 1s also probeble that a gas cooling system will prove more exjgensive.
A better comparison of the gas=cooled system with the sodium-cooled
system will result from a more detailed design study.

An elternate o the steam—cycle described above would be the
Loeffler boiler cycle. In this system (see Fig. 1.15) all the heat is
transferred to the steam in the superheater. A portion of the superheated
steam is recirculated by means of a steam pump to the boj.le_r,' where it
transfers heat to the water by direct contact to form saturated. steam.
With the seme steam conditions of 1000°F and 1800 psi, it would be neces-
sary to return approximately 2 1b of steam to the boiler for every pound
sent to the turbine. The advanta.ges of this system used in conjunction
with the molten-salt reactor are principally connected with the control
of heat flow. :I.'bh the sodimn—to-steam generator heat transfer system,
the steam genera.tor represents a 1arge ca.pacity heat sink &t a tempera-
ture more than 200°F below the freezing peint of the fuel bearing salt. |
To prevent freezing of the fuel, careful con’crol of flow in the seconde.ry

sodium circult must be mainteined at low'pcwer operation. In the
loeffler boller eystem, the directly coupled heat sink is dry steem in-
‘stead of water, end control of the steam circuletion is believed to be

| easier then the control of the sodium flow. The elimination of the need
for two speed pumps and control valves in the intermedisate circuit would
therefore result in a system that would more fully exploit the inherent
self-regulation of the molten-salt resctor. ”

The elimination of the steam generator from & sodium circuit reduces
the need for sodium flow regulation. The reduction bf sodium eguipment
probebly would result in less frequent meintenance, Thus some of the
serious objections to having radiocactive sodium heating the steem would
thereby be leSSened and consideration could be given to the elimination
of one of the intermediate circuits. In addition, since minimm tempere-
tures would, &t design point operation, be sbove the melting point of
sultable fluoride salts, their use in place of sodium should be exemined.
If substitution could be made, chemical compatibility of the intermediate
- fluid would be markedly improved both with respect‘td the fuel and the
steam and these hazards would be lessened.

More detailed design comparisons will be necessary to evaluate,this
boiler system. Although the changes suggested above are plausible, the
detailed consequences must be snalyzed and felr cost comparisons made. |

12.2. Alternate Fuels

 

The substitution of U235 for U255 in the molten fluoride reactors
would result in substantial improvement in performance. Uranium-233 is
& superior fuel in almost every respect. The fission cross section in
the intermediate range of neutron energies is greater than the fission
cross sectlons of 0235 and Pu?59. Thus, initiel inventories are less, -
and less additional fuel is reqﬁiréd to over-ride poisons. Alsc, the
n=-y cross section is substantially less, and the radiative capture
results in the immediate formation of a fertile isotope, P, e rate
of accumulation of 0256 is orders of magnitude smaller then with ﬂ255
fuel, end the buildup of Np>2! and Pu->? is negligible.

ventory was 129 kg, and the conversion ratio was 0.82. After operation
for one yesr at & load factor of 0.8 end with no reprocessing of the core

 to remove fission products, the inventory rose of 199 kg, and the regene

eration ratio fell to 0.7l. However, if the reprocessing required to

year of operation, the inventory increased slowly up to only 247 kg

The search for a liquid for use at high temperatures and low ;preé-
sures in & fluld-fueled reactor led to the choice of elther fluorides
or chlorides because of the requirements of radistion stebility end solu~
bility of epprecieble guentities of uranium and thorium, . The chlorides
(based on the CJ.3 T isotope) are most suitable for fast rea.ct-o:r use, but
the low thermal-neutron ebsorption cross section of £luorine _mak_es ‘the
fluorides seem to be & wniquely desireble choice for & high-temperature
£1uld-fucled reactor in the thermal- or epithermal-newtron reglon,

1.1, Choice of Active Fluoride

Urenium Fluoride. Uranium hexafluoride is 8 highly volat:l.le com~
pound, and it is obviously unsuiteble as e componént of & liguid for use
at high temperatures. Thae compound UOLF, o whie.h ie relatively nonvolstile,
1s a strong oxidant that would be very difficult to contain. Fluorides
1 ena.
would be prohibitively strong oxldants even if they could be stebilized
in solution. Uranivm trifluoride, when pure and under an lnert amosphere ’
is steble even &t temperatures above 1000°C; 293 however, it is not so
steble in molten fluoride solutions.,h It disproportiona tes apyrecie.bly
in such media by the reaction, ‘ ' )

at temperatures below 800°c, Emall emounts of UF5 are p‘emiesible in
the presence of rela,tively le.rge concentramions of UFL and may be bene-
fic:l.el insofer as corrosion is concerned, It is necessary, hewever, to
use UFh es the major uraniferous compound :I.n the fuel.

Thorium Fluoride. All the normel eompounds of thori\nn axre quadri—
valent; accordingly, any use of thorium in molten fluoride melts must
be aS ThFl‘.I

1.2. choice of Fuel Diluents

The fluoride eomposit:l.ons that will be discussed here are 1:I.mited
to those viich have & low vapor pressure &t 'm?‘c and which have & melting
point no higher then 550 Cs Also, there ig ‘1ittle interest in u:anim .

concentrations higher then & few per cent for the fuel of thermal reaétors ’
‘end therefore mixtures with high UF, content will be omitted from this

discussien.

Of the pure fluor:!.&es ef mol’aen-;salt reﬁc'bor interest, only ZBeF2
neets the melting point xequirement and 1t is too viscous for use in |
the pure state. Thus the fluorides of interest mre ternary or quaternary
mixtures containing UF), or TnF,. For the fuel,]_the relatively small
smounts of UF!; required meke the corresponding binary ‘or ternsxy. mixtures
of the diluents neerly controlling with regexd to physical properties .
such as the melting point. Only the elkelisfietal fluorides and the fluo- -
rides of bezyll:l.xm end zirconium have been given serious attention. ILead
end bismu'l;h fluorides, which might otherwise be ugeful because of their
low neutron a,bsorption, have been elimina,ted because they are reaﬂily

_reducea to the metallic eta:be by structural meta.ls such es iron a.nd

Measurements of total pressure in equilibrium with NaF-Zth-UFh
melts between 800 and 1000°¢ with the use of en a.pparatus similer to that

- described by Rodebush and D:!.J:onl5 yielded the date shown in Table 2.3.

Sense et a._l.,ls. vho used & transport method to eveluate partial pressures
in the NeF~-ZrF) system, obtained slightly different values for the vepor

:'_pressures and showed that the vapor phase sbove these’ liquids is quite

complex, The vapor=pressure ve.lues obtained from both investigations

are less 'l:.han 2 mm Hg for the equimolarx Na.F-ZrF,_‘_ mixture at 700°C. Bowe
ever, since the vapor 1s nearly pure ZrFu, end since Zth does not melt
under low Pressures of its vapor, even this modest vapor pressure leads

to engineering difficultles; all lines, eq_ui:pment s 8nd connections exposed
to the vapor must be protected from sublimed ZrF), "snow."

Mea.surements made with the Rodebuah apparatus have shown ‘that the

~vapor pressure sbove liquids of gnalogous composition' decreases with

increasing size of the alkeli cation, All these systems show large
negative deviations from Racult's lew, vhich are a consequence of the 1
lerge, positive, excess, partislemolar entropies of solution of 'szlt'
This phenomenon has been interpreted qualitetively es an effect of sube

stituting nonbridging fluoride ions for fluoride bridges between zirconium

lons as the alkeli fluoride concentration is increesed in the mel'l;.l7

[ '5 Fission Products of Uncertain Valence

The valenoe states asamned by the nonmetallio elements Se ’ Te ’ Br,

w '\ end T must depend stmngly on the oxidstion potential defined by the con-

ta.iner end the fluoride melt, end the states are not at present well de-

T : fined. The sparse thermochemical data suggest thet if they were in the.
s ';pure state the fluorides of Ge, As, Nb, Mo, Ru, Bh, P4, Ag, Cd, Sn, end

w Sb would be reduced to the corresponding metal by the chromium in Inconel.

v

| While. fluorides of some of these elements ma:y be sta‘bilizeé. in dilute
N ‘molten solution in the melt, it is possrbie 'bha.t none of this group exists
o es compounds in ‘the equilibrium mixture. An epprecisble ;. end ;proba.bly

1arge , fraction of the niobium and ruthenim _produced in the Aircraft
Rea.ctor m;periment was deposited in or on the Inconel walls of the fluid
circuit, e detectable » but probably smell, fraction of 'bhe mthenium was

volatilized, presumably as Rqu, from the melt. '

'5 3. Oxidizing Na.ture of the Fission Prooess

The fission of UFu would yield more eguivalents of ca.tion than of

- anion if the noble gas isotopes of half-life greater than 1o min were

- lost and if all other elements formed fluorides of their lowest'teported

PART 3
CONSTRUCTION MATERTALS FOR MOLTEN-SALT REACTORS
1. SURVEY OF SUITABLE MATERIALS

A molten-salt reactor system requires structural materiels which will

~ resist corrosion by the salts, and evaluation tests of verious materials
in fluoride selt mixtures have indicated that nickel;-b_a.se ‘elloys are, in |
lgeneral s Superior Vt_b other commercial alloys for the 'cpnte.imnent of these

salts under dynamic flow _conditiens. In order to select the ‘alloy best
suited to this application, en extensive progrem of corrosion tests was

| carried out on the gvelleble, commercilel, nickel-base alloys, particulerly,

Inconel, which ty;pifies the chmim—containing alloys, end Hestelloy B,
which is mpresentative of the molybdenm~conta1ning alloys. :

Alloys eontaining epprecieble quantities of chromiuvm are atta.cked
by molten selts ma.inly by the removel of chromium from hot-leg sections
through reaction with UFL;’ if present, and with cther axidizing m;purities
in the salt. The remova.l of chromiwm is accompanied by the formation of

. subsurface volds in the metal. The depth of vaid formation depends strongly
‘on the operating tan;peratures of the sys'tmn end on the cemposition of the

selt mixture.
On the other hand Hastelloy B, in wh:l.ch 'bhe chrmiwn is replaced with

o ‘molybdenum, shcws excellent con:patibility with fluoride salts even a.t tem-
| '_pera:bures in excess of 1.600°F. X tmfortunately, He.stelloy B cannot be used
| *'a.s & structural material 111 hig}z-»tempera.ture systems 'because of :Lts age-

: hardening characteristics and its poo:c oxidation resistance. |

The :Lnfomation gained :m the testing of Hastelloy B m Inconel led

Exeminations have demonstrated that the subsurface voids are not inter-
connected with each other or with the surface, Voids of the sene type
have been found in Inconel after high-temperature oxide.tien teets end |

- bigh-temperature vacuum tests in which chromium was selectively removed.

The selective removael of chromium by & fluoride salt mixture depends

on various chemical reactions, for example:

1, mPurities in the melt,

FeF, + Cr == CrF, + Fe (1)
2. Oxide £ilms on the metal surfa.ce ’

or 4+ 20F), v=* 2UF; + CrF, | (3)

The ferric fluoride formed by the reactlon of Eq. 2 dissolves in the melt -

and further attacks the chromium by the reaction of Eq. 1.

 The time dependence of void formation in Inconel, as observed both

-i:l.n thezmal—convection &nd forced.-circulation eyetems, indiceates that the

jit ariees from e. different ca.use, is simile.r to the phenomenon of tempera.ture-

gradient mass transfer observed in liquid metel corrosion.

..115..

 
 

 

 

 

 

 In molten-fluoride salt systems, the driving force f'or mass transfer
is a result of & tempersture dependence of the equilibrium constent for
~ the ree.etion ’oetween chromium and UF), (Eq. 3). If nickel and iron are
| considered inert diluents for chromium in Inconel, ‘the process can be
' eimly described Under ra.pid circulation s B unifom concentration of _
UIE’IL s UF,, and CrF2 is maintained throughout the fluid, the concentrations
- must satisfy the equili'brimn constent: ‘

where N represents the mole fraction and y the e.ctivity coefficient of
~ the indice.ted component.

Under these steady-state conditions, there exists a tempere.ture )

T, intermediate between the maximum and minimum temperature of the 1oop s
at which the initial composition of the structura.l metal is at eq_uilibrium
with the fused salt. Since KN increases with increasing tempere.ture,

the chramium concentration in the alloy surface is diminished at- tempera-
tures higher then T and is eugmented at temperatures lower than T. In
some melts, NeF-LiF-KF-UF),, for example, the equilibrium constant of
reaction 3 changes sufficiently with temperature under extreme tempera-
ture conditions to cause precipitation of pure chromium crystals in the
cold zone. In other melts, for example, NaF-ZrFk—UFu , the temperature
dependence of the corrosion equilibrium is small, and the equilibrium is
satlisfied at all useful temperatures without the formation of crystalline
chromivm. In the latter systems the rate of chromim remova.l from the
salt streem at cold-leg regions is dependent on the rate at which chromium

cen diffuse into the cold«leg wall. If the chromium concentration gre.dient

, tends to be small, or if the bulk of the cold-leg surface is held at a
- relatively low temperature, the corrosion rate in such systems is almost

- negligible,

 
 

 

 

* ‘-“:"."h" ".-“ *

It is obvious that saddition of the eguilibrium concentrations of

UF3 end che to nolten fluorides prior to circulation in Inconel equip=

' ment would minimize the initisl removal of chramiwm from the alloy by

reaction (3). (It would not, of course, affect the mess transfer process
which arises es a conseq_uence of the temperature dependence of this re-~
action.) Dellberate edditions of these materials have not been practiced
in routine corrosion tests because (1) the effect at the uranium concen=-
trations normelly employed is'sn1all and (2) the experimental and analytical
difficulties &re considerable. Ad.dition of more than the equilibrium
gquantity of U’F3 mey lead to deposition ‘of some ursnium metel in the eq_uip-
ment walls through the reaction

For ultimate use in reactor systems » however, it mey be possible to treat
the fuel material with calculated quantities of metallic chromimn to pro-

" vide the proper UF, and: (,trF2 concentrations at starbup.

o According to the theory described above, there should be no great
difference in the corrosion found in thermale~convection loops and in
forced-ci'rculation loops. The data are in general agreement with this-

conclusion as long as the same mexXlmm metal-salt interface temperature
is present in both types of loop.' The results of many tests with both
types of loop are summerized in Table 3.2 without distinguishing between
the two ty'pes of loop. The maximum bulk temperature of the salt as it
left the heated seetion cf the loop is given. It ie known that the actual
metal-salt interface temperature was not greater than 1300 F in the loops

;with a maximmn salt temperature of 1250 F and was between 1600 and 1650°F
- "’for the loop with & maximm aelt temperature of 1500 F.

The data in Table 3.2 are grou;ped. by ty:pes of base salt, because

At the temperature of interest in molten-salt reactors, that is,
1250°F, the seme trend of relative corrosiveness of the different salte
may exist for Inconel, but the low rates of attack observed in tests pre-
clude & conclusive decision on this point. Similexrly, if there is any |
preferential effect of the base salts on INOR-8, the small amounts of
attack tend to hide it.

As expected from the theory, the corrosion depends sharply on the
UFI‘_ concentration. Studies of the nuclear properties of molten-salt
- power reactors have indicated (see Parb L) that the UF,+ content of the
fuel will ususlly be less then 1 mole %, end therefore the corrosiveness
of salts with higher UF), concentrations, such as those described in
Teble 3.2, will be avoided.

The extreme effect of temperature is also clearly indicated in
Table 3.2. 1In general, the corrosion retes are three to six times higher
at 1500°F then et 1250°F. Thie effect 1s further emphasized in the photo-
micrographs presented in Figs. 3.3 end 3.4, which offer & comparison of
metallographic specimens of Inconel that were ex;oosed to similar' salts
of the NaF-ZrF,_'_-UFu system at 1500 F end at 1250 F. A metsllographic
- specimen of Inconel thet was exposed et 1250 F to the salt proposed for
fueling of the molten-salt power reector is shown in Fig. 3.5

The effect of sodium on the stmctural materials of interest has
also been extensively studied, since sodium is. proposed for use &as the
intemediate heat transfer meditm. Gorrosion pro'blems inherent in the

:.utilization of sodium for hsat transfer purposes do not involve so much
the deterioration of the mets.l surfaces as the tendency for components
: -of the container materiaJ. to be transpozted from hot to cold regions and
| j‘f to :E'orm plugs of deposited material in the cold region. As in the case
‘of the. corrosion by the salt mixture, the mass transfer in. sodiume |
_conta.ining systems is extremely dependent on the ma.ximtm system operating
_temperature The results of mmerous tests indicate that the nickel-base

S 'alloys such es Inconel and INOR-B are se.tisfs.ctory containers for sodium

ole Casting
Normal melting procedures , such &s induction or electric furnace
melting, ere suiteble for preparing INOR-8. Specielized techniques, such

" &as melting under vacuum or consumeble-electrode melting, have aleo been

used without difficulty. Since the major ealloying constituents do not
heve high vepor pressures end ave relatively inert, melting losses are

- negligible, and thus the speciﬂed chemical composition can be obtained

through the use of standexrd melting techniques. Preliminam;r studies in-
dicate that intricately sheped components can be cast from this material.

5-2. Hot Fbrging
The temperature range of forgeebility of INOR-8 is 1800 to 2250°F.

This wide range permits opera.tions such &s hammer end press forging with
& minimum number of reheets between passes end substantial reductions

without cracking. The production of hollow shells for the manufecture
of tubing has been accomplished by extruding Porged end drilled billets

- Forgeability studies bave shown that veriations in the carbon con-
tent have en effect on the cold forming of the alloy. Slight variations
of other components, in general; have no significant 'effe'-cts. The solid
solubility of carbon in the alloy is ebout 0.01%. Carbon present in
excess of this amount precipitetes as discrete particles of (Ni, Nb)sc
throughout the matrix; the particles dissolve sparingly even a:b the high
annealing temperature of 2150 F. Thus, cold working of the .a.lloy causes
these particles to align in the direction of elongation, and if they are
pre'een'b in sufficient quentity, they form continuous stringers of carbides,
The lines of weekness caused by the stringers are sufficient to propagate
longitudinal fractures in tubular :products during fabrication. The upper
limit of the carbon content for tubing is sbout 0.10%, and for other pro-
ducts it a.Ppea.rs to be grea.ter than 0,20%. The carbon content of the
elloy is comtrollsble to ebout O. 02% in the renge below 0.10%.

3,14,  Welding

The parts of the reactoi' system are joined by welding, and there-
fore the integrity of the system is in large measure dependent on the
reliebllity of the welds. During the welding of thick sections, the
material will be subjected to & high degree of restraint, and consequently
both the base metal and the weld metel must not be susceptible to cracking,

. embrittlement, or other undesirable features.

 Extensive tests of weld specimens he.ve been made. The circuler- -
sroove test ’ which ‘accwrately predicted the welde.bility of conventional

o materie.ls w:tth knom welding chare.cterietics » was found to give relieble
. results for nickel-'base alloys.. In the circule.r-gmave test, an inert-

that did not contain boron similarly did not crack when subjected to

the circular-groove test.

In order to further study the effect of boron in INOR~8 heats,
several 3-1b vacuum-melted ingots with nominsl boron contents of up to
0.10% were prepered, slotted, and welded as shown in Fig. 3.8, All
ingots with 0.02% or more boron cracked in this test.

A procedure specification for the welding of INOR-8 tubing is
evaileble thet is based on the results of these cracking tests and exami-
netions of numerous successful welds, The integrity of & joint, which
18 & measure of the quality 6fﬁ.a_;_"-'weld, is determined through visusal,
rediogrephic, and metallogrephic exsminations and mechanical tests at
room and service temperatures. It haes been esteblished through such
examinstions end tests that Sound joints cen be made in INOR-8 tubing
that contains less than 0.02% boron.

Weld test pla:bes of the type shown in Fig. 3.9 have also been used
for studying the mecha.nica.l properties of welded Joints. Such test
plates were side-bend tested in the epparatus illustrated in Fig. 3.10.
The results of the tests, presented in Table 3.3, indicate excellent
weld metal ductility. For exemple, the ductility of heat M-5 materlal
is greater then 40% at temperatures up to and including 1500 F.

The nickel-base brazing alloys listed in Teble 3.4 have been shown
- to be satisfactoxy in contact with the salt mixture LiF-KFhNaF%UFh

tests conducted at 1500 F for 100 hr. Further two precious metal-ba.se
brazing alloys, 82% Au-18% Ni end 80% Au-ao% Cu, were unattacked in the
L:I.F-vKF-Na.F-UFll_ salt after 2000 hr at 1200°F. These two precious metel
alloys were also tested in the LiF=-BeF -UFh'mixture and again were not
attacked.

3.6, Nondestructive Testing
 An ultrasonic inspection techniqgue is eveilsble for the detection

of flaws in -pla.te ’ ‘piping, and tubing. The _water-imer_sed pulse-echo .
‘ultrasound equipment has been edapted to high-speed use. Eddy current,-
dye penetrent, and rediogrephic inspection methods are elso used as
 required. The inspected materials have included Inconel, austenitic

" stainless steel, INOR-8, and the Hastelloy and other nickel-molybdenum-
:I'baé';e alloys. ‘ | '
Methods ere being developed for the nondestructive testing of 'weld-
‘ments during initial construction and after replacement by remote means
in & high«intensity radiation field, such as that which will 'be"";‘presen‘b
if maintenance work is required after operation of a molten-salt . reactor.
Thé ultrasonic technique appears to be best suited to semi~automatic a.nd
remote operation, and it will probebly be the least affected by. radietion
of any of the applicable methods. Studies have indicated that the dif-
ficultié-s‘ encountered in the ultrasonic inspe'cticn of Inconel welds and
‘_!,';relds' of some of the austenitic stainless steels because the weld struce
| tures have high ultrasonic 'a.ttenuation are not present in the inspection
' of INOR-8 welds. The high ultrasonic attenuation is not present in INOR~8
welds because the base metal and the weld metal are of the same composi-
tion. The mechanical equipment designed for the remote welding operation
will be useful for the inspec’o:l.on operation. ' '

In the routine inspecticn of reactor-grade construction materials ’
a tube, pipe, plate, or rod is rejected if & void is detected that is
larger than 5% of the thickness of the part being inspected. In the

4, MECHANICAL AND THERMAL PROPERTIES OF INOR-8

L.1, Elasticity

A typicel stress-strain curve for INOR-8 &t 1200 F is shown in Fig.
3.1l. Data from similar curves obtained from tests at room temperature
up to 1400°F are summarized in Fig. 3.12 to show changes in tensile
strength, yield strength, and ductility as & function of temperature.
| The temperature dependence of the Young's modulus of this materlel is
illustra.ted in Fig. 3.13. -

4.2, Plasticity

A series of relaxation tests of INOR-8 at 1200 end 1300°F ha.ve
indiceted that creep will be an importent design consideration .for
reactors operating in this temperature range. -The rate at which
the stress must be relaxed in order to maintain a .eons’ca.ﬁt elastic:
~ strain st 1300°F is shown in Fig. 3.1k, and similar data for 1200°F
ere presented in Fig. 3.15. The time lapse before the,ma.tei'ial |
becomes plastic is ebout 1 hr at 1300°F and sbout 10 hr at 1200°F,
The time péﬁéd during which the materiel behaves elastically becomes

yet undetermined, the metal will continue to behave elasticelly indefi-
nitely.

It is possible to sumarize the creep dete by comparing the times
to 1,0% total strain as & function of stress in the date shown in Fig.
'3.16. The reproducibility of creep datae for this meterisl is indicated
by.the separate curves shown in Fig. 3.17. It may be seen that quite
good correlation between the creep curves is obtained at the lower stress
values. Some scatter in time to rupture occurs at 25,000 psi, & stress
vhich corresponds to the 0.2% offset yleld strength at this temperature.
‘Such scatter is to be expected et this high stress level,

The tensile strengths of several metals ere compared with the tensile
strength of INOR-8 at 1300°F in the following tabulation, and the creep
properties of the several alloys at 1.0% strain are compered in Fig. 3.18:

' Tensile Strength at

 

Material 1300°F (psi)

Cr-Mo steel (5% Cr) 20,000
Hastelloy B 70,000
Hastelloy C 100,000
Inconel | 60,000
INOR=8 65,000

The test results indicete that the elastic and plastic strengths of

INOR-8 &are near the top of the range of strengﬁh'prbperties of ﬁhe several |

alloys commonly considered for high-temperature use. Since INOR-8 was
designed to avoid the defects inherent in these other metals, it is ap-
perent that the undesirable aspects have been eliminated without emy
serious loss in strength. |

h.3. Aging Characteristics

Numerous secondary phases that are cepeble of embrittling & nickel-
base alloy cen exist in the Ni-Mo=Cr-Fe-C system, but no brittle phase
exists if the alloy contains less than 20% Mo, 8% Cr, end 5% Fe. INOR-S,

5. OXIDATION RESISTANCE

The oxidation resistance of nickel-molybdenum elloys depends on the

~ service temperature, the tempersture cycle, the molybdenum content, end

the chromium content. The oxidation rate of the binsry nickel-molybdenum

-~ alloy passes through & meximm for the alloy conteining 15% Mo, and ‘the

scele formed by the oxidation is N:I.Mooh end NiO. Upon thermal cycling

from above 1400°F to below 660° F, the NiMoO) undergoes & phase transforma-

tion which causes the protective scale on the oxidized metal to spall.

Subsequent temperature cycles then result in an accelersted oxidation

rete. Similerly, the oxidation rate of nickel-molybdenum alloys contain-

ing chromium passes through a maximm for alloys conteining between 2

and 6% Cr. Alloys containing more than 6% Cr are insensitive to thermal

cycling and the molybdenmum content because the oxide scale is predominantly -

 stable Cry0,.  An abrupt decrease, by a factor of about 40, in the oxida~

~ ‘tion re.te et 1800°F is observed when the chromium content is increased . .
 from 5.9 to 6.2%. )

The oxidation resistanée of INOR~8 is excél'lént » and continuous
operation et temperatures up to 1800°F is feesible. ~ Intermittent use
at temperatures &s high at 1900°F could be tolerated. - For temperatures
up to 1200° F, the oxidation rate is not measurable; it is essentia.lly
nonexistent after 1000 hr of exposure in static air, It is estimated
that oxidetion of 0.001 to 0.002 in. would occur in 100,000 hr. of opera-
tion at 1200°F. The effect of tempersture on the oxidstion rate of the
elloy is shovn in Table 3.8.

6. FAERTCATION OF A DUPLEX TUBING HEAT EXCHANGER

The compatibility of INOR-8 and sodium is adequate in the tempera~
ture renge presently contempla.ted for molten-salt reactor heat exchanger
opei'é.tion. At higher temperatures, mass transfer could become & problem,
end therefore the fabrication of duplex tubing has been investigated.

- - _Satisfa.-étory duplex tubing has been made that consists of Inconel clad
with type 316 stelnless steel, and components for & duplex heat exchenger

have been febricated, as shown in Fig. 3.20.

The febricetion of duplex tubing is eccomplished by coextrusion of

' billets of the two alloys. The high temperature and pressure used result
- in the formation of & metallurgical. bond between the two alloys. In
' Subsequent reduction steps the bonded cmosite behaves as one materiel,
‘The ra.tios of the alloys tha:b comprise the composite axe controllable to

increased in depth along the grain boundaries with increases in the tem-
pereture. The interface of & duplex sheet held at 1300°F for 500 hr is
shown in Flg. 3.22. Tests of this sheet shoved an ultimete tensile
strength of 94,400 psi, & 0.2% offset yleld strength of 36,800 psi, and
an elongation of 51%. Creep tests of the sheet showed that the diffusion
resulted in an incremse in the ereep resistance with no significa.nt loss
of duetility. - -

Thus , DO ma,jor difficulties would be expected in the construction -
of an BWOR-B--steinless steel heat exchanger. The construction experience
thus fer has involved on.ly the 20-tube heat exchanger shoim in Fig. 3.20.

7. -AVAILABILITY OF INOR-8

has shown them toshave properties similar to those of the laboratory heats
prepared for material selection. Purchase orders are filled by the vendors

carburization of the nickel«alloy container.

Many molten fluoride salts have been melted end hendled in graphite
crucibles, end in these short-temm uses, the grephite is inert to the
salt., Tests at temperatures up to lBQOoF with the ternary salt mixture
Iﬁi&r.F-ZrFll_-UF,L geve no indication of the decomposition of the fluoride and
no gas evolution eo long &s the graphite was free from a silicon impurity.

Ionger«time tests of graphite immersed in fluoride salts have shown
greater indications of penetration of the graphite by salts, end it must
be assumed thet the salt will eventually penetrate the availeble pores .

in the graphite. The "impermesble"” grades of graphite aveileble experi-

menta.lly show greater reduced penetration and & semple of high~density,
bonded, natural graphite (De Gussa.) ghowed very little penetration.
Although q_ua.utita.tive figures are not availeble, it is likely that the
extent of penetration of "1mpemee.ble" 'gre.phite gredes cen be tolerated.

Although these penetration tests showed no visible effects of attack
of the graphite by the salt, anslyses of the salt for carbon showed that

9. MATERIALS FOR VALVE SEATS AND EEARING SURFACES

Neerly all metels, alioys, and.hard-facing materials tend to undergp
solid-phase bonding when held togethor under pressure in molten fluoride
selts et temperatures above 1000 F. -Such bonding tends to make the

startup of hyﬂrodynamio bearings difficult or impossible, and it reducea |

the chance of opening a valve that has been closed for eny length of
time. Screening tests in & search for nombonding materials thet will
stend wp under the moltenusalt enviromment have indicated that the most
promising:materiqls are TiC-Ni end WC~-Co types of cermete with nickel

or cobalt cofitents of less than 35 wt %, tungsten, and molybdenum. The
tests, in general, have been of less than 1000-hr duretion, so the useful
lives of these materials have not yet been determined., |

10. SUMMARY OF MATERIAL PROBLEMS

Although much experimentel work remains to be done before the con-
struction of & complete power reactor sysiem can begin, 1t is apparent
that considereble progress hes been achieved in solving the materiel
problems of the reactor core. A strong, steble, and corrosion-resistant
alloy with good welding and forming characteristics is evailable. Pro-
duction technigues have been developed, and the alloy has been produced
in commercial quantities by several alloy'vendors.r'Finally it‘appears
that, even at the peak operating temperazure, no serious effect on the
alloy oceurs when the molten salt it contains 1s in direct contact with

graphite.

'NUCIEAR ASPECTS OF MOI.TEN-;S'AL'I‘ REACTORS.

‘ The ability of certain molten salts to dissolve uranium and thorium salts -
in quantities of reactor interest made possible the consideration of fluid-fueled
reactors with thorium in the fuel, without the danger of nuclear accidents as a
result of the settling of a slurry. This additional degree of freedom has been
exploited in the study of mOlten-salt reactors. , ,

Mixtures of the fluorides of alkali metals and zirconium or beryllium, as
discussed in Part 2, possess the most desirable combination of low neutron
absorption, high solubility of uranium and thorium compounds, chemical inert-
ness at high temperatures, and thermal and radiation stability. The following
' comparison of the capture eioss sections of the alkali metals reveals that Ii7
containing 0.01% 116 has a. cross section at 0.0795 ev and 1150 F that is a
factor of & lower than that of sodium, which also has a low cross section:

| The.capture eross section of beryllium 1is also'satisfactorily low at all
. neutron energies, and therefore ‘mixtures of IiF and BeF Y which have satisfac-
tory melting points, viscosities, and solubilities for UFh and ThFu, were
selected for investigation'in the reactor physics study.

| Mixtures of NaF, Zth, ‘and UFh were studied.previously, and such a fuel
was successfully used in the Aircraft Reactor Experiment (see Parts 1 and 2).
Tnconel was shown to be reasonably resistant to corrosion by this mixture at
1500 F, and there is reason to expect that Inconel equipment would have a life
of atlleast several years at 1200 F. As a fuel for a central-station power
Lipreactor, however, the NaE-Zth systemjhas several serious disadyantages. 'The

T

w 160 =

 
 

 

sodium capture cross section is less favorable than that of Ii?: More important,
recent datal indicate.that'the capture cross eection'of zirconium is qnite-high

in the epithermal'and.intermediate neutron energy ranges. In eomparison with

the IiE%BeFé syetem, the NaFerFu_systen'has inferior heat transfer characteristics.
Finally, the INOR alloys (see Part 3) show promise of being as resistant to the
beryllium salts as to the zirconium salts, and therefore there is no compelling :
reason for selecting the NaF-ZrFu system. I

- from group scattering and 1eakage parameters taken from an Ocusol calculation. B
A critical calculation reqnires about 1 min on the Oracle; changes in concen-
‘tration of 1k elements duringia.specified time can then be computed in about

1 sec. The major assumpticn involved is that the group scattering and leakaget
_'probabilities do not change appreciably with changes in core composition as

: burnup progresses. This asénmption has been verified to a satisfactory degree -
of approximation.; '” . | '

The molten salts may be used as homogeneous moderators or simply as fuel
carriers in heterogeneous reactors. Although, as discussed below, graphite-
moderated heterogeneous reactors have certain potential advantages, their
technical feasibility depends upon the compsatibility of fuel, ‘graphite, and
metal, which has not as yet ‘been established. For this reason, the homogeneous
reactors, although inferior in nuclear performance, have been given greatest
attention. ; - - o

A preliminary study _in‘dicated that, if the integrity of the core vessel
could be guaranteed, theunuclear economy of two-region resctors would probably
be superior to that of bare-and reflected one-region reactors. ‘The two-region
reactors were, accordingly, studied in detail. Although entrance and exit con-
ditions dictate othernthan a spherical shape, it was necessary, for the calcu-
'lations, to use = model comprising the following concentric spherical regions:
(1) the core, (2) an INOR-8 core vessel 1/3 in. thick, (3) a blanket approxi-
mately 2 £t thick, and (h) an INOR-8 reactor vessel 2/5 in. thick. The diameter’
of the core and the concentration of thorium in the coré were selected as inde-
pendent Variables. The primary dependent varisbles were the critical concentra-
tion of the fuel (U255 U?BB, or Pu 39), and the distribution of the neutron '
absorptions among the- various atomic species in the reactor. From these, the
critical mass, critical inventory, regeneration ratio, burnup rate, etc., can
be readily calculated, as described in the following section.

The study of homogeneous reactors wes dirided into two phases: (1) the

* mapping of the nuclear characteristics of the initial (1.e., "clean") states

- ag a function of core diameter and'thorium concentration; and (2) the analysis
of the.subsequent performance of selected_initial states with various process-
-ing schenmes and,rates. The detailed results of these studies are givenfin_the
following paragraphs. Briefly, it was found that regeneration ratios- of up

to 0.65 can be obtained with moderate investment in U2557(1ess than 1000 kg)
and that;.if the fission products. are moved (Section 1.2) at a"rate such that
the equilibrium inventory is\equai to one year's production, the regeneration
ratio can be maintained above 0.5 for at least 20 years.

1.1 Initial States

A complete parametric study of molten fluoride sait reactors having"
diameters in the range of U to lO”ft and thorium concentrations in the fuel
ranging from O to 1 mole % ThFh was performed. In these resctors, the basic .
fuel salt (fuel salt No. 1) was & mixture of 31 mole % BeF,, and 69 mole % I4F,
which has a density of about 2.0 g/cm at 1150 F. The core vessel was composed
of INOR-8. Thé blanket fluld (blanket salt No. 1) was a mixture of 25 mole %

' ThF, and 75 mole % LiF, vhich has e density of about 4.3 g/em’ at 1150°F. In

order to shorten the calculations in this series, the reactor vessel was neg-

lected, since the resultent error was small. These reactors contained no fis-
sion products or nonfissionable isotopes of uranium other than U238

A summary of the results is presented in Table k.1, in which the neutron
balance is presented in terms of neutrons absorbed in a given element per neu-
tron ebsorbed in U255 (both by fission and the n-y reaction). The sum of the
. absorptions is therefore equal to n, the number of neutrons produced by'fission
7fper neutron absorbed in fuel. Further, the sum of the absorptions in 023 and

_thorium in the fuel and in thorium Ain the blanket salt glves directly the re-

"-:generation ratio.; The losses to other elements are penalties 1mposed on the

'~‘regeneration ratio by these poisons, i e., if the core vessel could be con-

'-'structed of some material with a negligible cross section, the regeneration

 

: 'ratio could be increased'by the amount listed for capture in the core vessel.
| The inventories 1n these reactors depend in part on the volume of the

~ fuel in the pipes, pumps, ‘and hest exchangers in the external portion of the
fuel circuit. The inventories Iisted in Table-h 1 are for systems having &

"volume of 339 ft5 externsl to the core, which corresponds approximatelyfto a
power level of 600 Mw of heet. In these calculations it was assumed that the
heat was transferred to an intermediate coolant composed of the fluorides of |
14, Be,'and Na before being'transferred_to'sodium metal. In more recent designs
-'(see'Psrt 1), this intermediate seltsloop has been replaced by a sodium loop
and the external volumes are-somewhst'less because of the-iﬁproVed equipnent

 Critical Concentration, Mass, Inventory, and Regeneration Ratio., The |
data in Teble 4.1 are moyre easily comprehended in the form of graphs, such as
Pig. k.1, which presents the critical concentration in these reactors as a '
function of core diameter and thorium concentration in the fuel salt. The ,
_data points represent calculated values, and the 1ines are reasonsble inter-
polations. The maximum concentration calculated, about 35 x 10 19 atoms of ,
55 per cubic centimeter of fuel sslt, or about 1 mole % UFu, is an order of ,'
magnitude smaller than the maximum permissible concentration (sbout 10 mole. %).
The corresponding eritical masses are graphed in Fig. 4.2. As may be seen
the critical mass is.a rather complex function of the diameter and the thorium :
concentration. - The calculated points are shown here also, and the solid lines
represent, it is felt, reliable interpolations. The dashed lines were drawn
vwhere insufficienttnumbers of points were calculated to define the curves preQ
=cisely; however, they are'thought to be qualitatively correct. Since reactors
-having dismeters less than 6 ft are not economically attractive, only one case
with a b-ft-dia core was computed. ‘
 The critical masses obtained in this study ranged from 40 to 400 kg of
U255; However, the critical inventory in the entire fuel circuit is of more
interest to the reactor designer than is the criticel mass. The critical in- '
ventories corresponding to an external fuel volume of 339 ft5 are therefore
~ shown in Fig. h 3. Inventories for other external volumes may be oomputed

from slightly above 100 kg in an 8- ft dia-core with no thorium present to
‘"1500 kg in a 5-ft~dia core with 1 mole % ThFh present.i

The optimum combination of’ core diameter and thorium concentration is, o fa

qualitatively, that-Which minimizes the sum of inventory - charges (including
charges on Ii7, ‘Be, and Th) and fuel reprocessing costs.' The fuel costs are .
directly related to the regeneration ratio, and this varies in a complex |
,_manner with” inventory of U255 and thorium concentration, as shovn in Meg. h k
It may be seen that, at a glven thorium concentration, the regeneration ratio '
(with one exception) passes through a maximum as the core dismeter is varied N
_between 5 and 10 ft. These maxima ‘increase with increasing thorium concen-
tration, but the inventory values at which they oceur also incérease. ,
T Plotting the maximum regeneration ratio versus critical inventory -generates .
the eurve shown in Fig. 4.5, It may be seen that a small investment "in U235
(200. kg) will give a regeneration ratio of 0, 58 that 400 kg will give a ratio ..°
of O. 66, and that further increases in fuel. inventory have little effect.
The effects of changes in the compositions of the fuel and blanket salts

_are indicated in the following description of the results of a series of cal-

' culations for which salts with more favorable melting points and viscosities

" were assumed. The ﬁeF content vas raised to 37 mole % in the fuel salt (erl

. salt No. 2) and the blanket composition (blanket salt No..2) was fixed at 13
mole % THF),, 16 mole 4, BeF s end Tl mole % IiF. Blanket salt No. 2 is & some-

- what better reflector than No. 1, and fuel salt No. 2 8 somewhat better moderator.

A8 & result, at a. given core diameter and’ thorium concentration in the fuel salt,

fboth the critical concentration and the regeneration ratio are somewhat lower
for the No. 2 salts. o ’

| Reservations concerning the feasibility of constructing and guaranteeing
the 1ntegrity of core vessels in large sizes (10 ft.and over), together wvith
preliminary consideration of inventory charges for large systems, led to ‘the
conclusion that a feasible reactor would probably have a ccre dlameter lying
in the range betveen 6 and 8 ft. Accordingly, ‘8, parametric study-in thiS'range
with the No. 2 fuel and blanket salts was performed~ In this study the presence
| of an outer reactor vessel consisting of 2/5 in. of INOR-8 was teken into sccount.
| The results are presented in Teble h:aaand.Figs h'6 and 4.7.. In general)’ the
‘nuclear performance is somewhat‘better with the -No." 2 salt than with the No. 1

Neutron Balances andNMiscellaneous Details.:'The distributions of the
neutron captures are given in Tables 4.1 and 4.2, where the relative hard-
ness of the neutron spectrum is indicated by the median fission energies
and the percentages of thermal fissions. It may be seen that losses to Ii,
Be, and F in the fuel salt and to the core vessel are substantial, especially
in the more thermal reactors (e.g., Case No. 18). However, in the thermal

235

reactors, losses by radiative capture in U are relatively low. Increasing
the hardness decreases losses to salt and core vessel sharply (Case No. 5),
but increases the loss to the n-y reaction. It is these opposing trends
which account for the complicated relation between regeneration ratio and
critical inventory exhibited in Figs. 4.4 and 4.7. The numbers given for
capture in the Ii and F in the blanket show that these elements are well
shielded by the thorium in the blanket, and the leakage values show that
leakage from the reactor is less than 0.01 neutron per neutron absorbed in
U255'in reactors over 6 ft in diameter. The blanket contributes substantially
to the regeneration of fuel, accounting for not less than one-third of the
total even in the 10-ft-dia core containing 1 mole % ThF) «

Effect of Substitution of Sodium for 117 In the event that 117 should
prove not to be available in quantity, it would be possible to operate the

 

reactor with mixtures of sodium and beryllium fluorides as the basic fuel

salt. The penalty imposed by sodium in terms of critical inventory and regen-
eration ratio is shown in Fig. 4.8, where typical Na-Be systems are compared
with the correSponding Ii?Be systems. With no thorium in the core, the use

- of sodium increases the criticel inventory by a factor of 1.5 (to about 300 kg)
| eand 1owers the regeneration ratio by a factor of 2.~ The regeneration penalty

“fis less severe, percentagewise, with l mole % ThFh 1n the fuel salt, in an -

f41f8 ft-dia core, the inventory rises from 800 kg to. 1100 kg and the regeneration
:fiiﬂratio falls from O 62 to O 50._ There is scme doubt concerning the validity of
_-ffithe pcint representing the 10—ft dia core for the Na-Be system with 1.0 mole %
'3'5ThFh, the explanation for the apparently abberant behavicr may'be that sodium |

gthe neutron balances are given in Table h 3 ‘“f :J'”'jf.-'_ . ,

Heat Release in Core Vessel and Blanket. The core vessel Mo'f-é._hibltéh{ |

salt reactor is‘ heated by gamne. radiatibn'emana.ting from the core and blanket

and from within the core vessel 1tse1f. Estima.tes of the gamma heating can |
be cbtained by dete.iled enalyses of the type illustrated by Alexander a.nd
Ma.nn 9 The gamma, -ray heating in the core vessel of a reactor with an 8-ft- d:la
core a.nd 0.5 mole % IhFh in the fuel salt has been estimated to be the following°

 

' Soureé' | S | Hea.t Réiea.se Rate (w/cm5)

" n-7 capture in blanket | - - 0.3
o | Total 11.k

Estimates of gaxma-ray source strengths can be used to provide a crude
estimate of the gemma~ray current entering the blanket. For the 8-ft-dia

‘core, the core contributes 45,3 w of gamma energy per square centimeter to

the blanket and the core vessel contributes 6.8 w/cm , which, multiplied by
_the gurface area of the core vessel, gives a total energy escape into the
blanket of 28.8 Mv. Some of this energy will be reflected into the core, of
course, and some will escape from the reactor vesael, and therefore the value

~of 28.8 Mv is en upper limit. To this may be added the heat released by cap-

ture of neutrons in the blanket. From. the Ocusol-A caleulation for the
8-ft-dia. core and & fuel salt conta.ining 0.5 mole % ThF), it was found that .

'0 176 of the neutrons would be captured in the bla.nketa If an energy relea.se .

of T mev/capture 1 assumed, the heat release at s power level of 600 Mw {heat) 7—
1s estimated to be 8.6 M7, The total is thus 47.4 Mw, or say, 50 ¥ 10 Mw,_ to .
allow for errors. .. | S | |

geneous molten-sslt reactor changes during operation at power because of the
accumulation of fission:products end nonfissionable isotopes of‘uranium. It
is necessary to add U255 to the fuel salt to overcome these poisons;'and, as
a result, the neutron spectrum is hardened and the regeneration ratio decreases

235

because of the accompanying decrease in 1 for U7 and the increased competition
for neutrons by the poisons relative to thorium. The accumulation of the superior
fuel U233 compensates for these effects only in part. The decline in the regen-
eration ratio and the inerease in the critical inventory during the first year of
operation of three reaotors'having 8-ft-dia cores charged, respectively, with
- 0.25, 0.75, and 1 mole % ThFhare-illustrated in Fig. 4.9. The critical inventory
increases by about 300 kg, and the regeneration ratio falls about 164. The gross
burnup of fuel in the reactor charged with 1 mole % ThF), and operated at 60C Mw
with a load factor of 80 amounts to about 0.73 kg/day. The 2 burnup falls
from this value as U~ assumes part of the load. During the first month of
operation, the °? burnup averages 0.69 kg/day. Overcoming the poisons requires
1.53 kg more and brings the feed rate to 2.22 kg/day. 'The initial rate is high
because of the holdup of bred-fuel in the form of Pa->2. As the concentration of
this isotope approaches equilibrium, the £ feed rate falls rapidly. At the
end of the first year the burnup rate has fallen to 0.62 kg/day and the feed rate
to 1.28 kg/day. At this time U253 contributes about 12% of the fissions. The
reactor contains 893 kg of U255,770 kg of U233 7 kg of Pu 59 62 kg of U236

‘and 181 kg of fission products.: The Ua;g end the fission prodncts capture 1.8

the addition rate is down to 0.50 kg/day, and it continues to decline slowly
to 0.39 kg/day after 20 years of operation. The nonfissionable isotopes of -
uranium continue to accumulate, of course, but these are nearly compensated
for by the ingrowth of U772, As shown in Fig. 4.10, the inventory of N
actually decreases for several years in a typlcal case, and then increases
only moderately during a lifetime of 20 years.

The rapid increase in eritical inventory of U235 during the first year
can be avoided by partial withdrawal of thorium. In Fig. 4.10 the dashed
lines indicate the course of events when thorium is removed at the rate of
1/900 per day. Burnup reduces the thorium concentration by another 1/4300
per day. The U255 inventory rises to 826 kg and then falls, at the end of
elght months, to 587 kg. At this time, the processing rate is increased to
1/240 per day (eight-month cycle), but the thorium is returned to the core
and the thorium concentration falls thereafter only by burnup. It may be
seen that the U235 inventory creeps up slowly and that the regeneration ratio
falls slowly. The increase in U255 inventory could have been prevented by
withdrawing thorium at a small rate; however, the regeneration ratio would
have fallen somewhat more rapidly, and more U235 feed would have been required

to compensate for burnup.
2. FOMOGENEOUS REACTORS FUEIED WITH U=~

Uranium-233 is a superior fuel for use in.molten-fluoride salt reactors
in almost every respect. _The fission croes seetion in the intermediate range
of neutron energies is greeter than the fission cross sections of 0255 and

239 Thus initiel eritical inventories are 1ess, and 1ess edditionel fuel
is required to override poisone. Aleo, the peresitic oross section is sub-
;stantially less, end fewer neutrons are lost to radietive capture. Further,.,r
37%the radiative captures result in the immediete fbrmation of a fertile isotope,,~

.71125 e rate of eecumulation of U2 is orders of’megnitude emaller then
' iwith U 35 es a fuel, and buildup of Np237 and Pu 39 is negligib1e¢.ﬁ,r'

The mean neutron energy is rather nearer to thermel in these reactors
than it is in the correeponding UEBS cages, COnsequently, ‘losses to core
vessel and to core salt tend to be higher. Both losses will be reduced sub-
stantlially at higher thorium concentrations. |

2.1 Initial States

Results from s parametric study of the nuclear characteristics of two—
region, homogeneous, molten-fluoride-salt reactors fueled with U 233 are giVen
in Tsble k.5. The core diameters considered range from 3 to 10 ft, and the
thorium concentrations range from 0.25'to'1 mole %. Although the regeneration
ratios are less than unity,.they are very good compared with those obtained
with U255. With 1 mole % ThF), in an 8-ft-dis t::ore,‘the.’l]‘?j'3 inventory vas |
only 196 kg, and the regeneration ratio vas 0.91. ~ - )

' The regeneretion ratios and fuel inventories of reactors of various
diameters containing 0.25 mole % thorium gnd . fueled'with U235 or U 53
compared in Fig. h.ll. The superiority of U235 is obvious.

2.2 Intermediate States

Calculations of the long-term performance of one reactor (Case 51, stle
4.5) with U233 as. the fuel are described below. The core diaemeter used was
8 £t end the thorium concentration was 0.75 mole % The changes in inventory
of U253 end regeneration ratio ate listed in Table 4.6. During the first year
of operation, the inventory rises from 129 to 199 kg, and the regeneration ratio
falls from 0.82 to 0.Tl. - If the reprocessing required to hold the concentration
of fission products and Np 57 constant is begun at this time, the inventory of
U235 increases slowly to 247 kg and the regeneration ratio rises slightly to
0.73 during the next 19 years. This constitutes a substantial improvement‘over

the performance with U235

L. HETEROGENEOUSV GRAPHITE-MODERATED REACTORS

The use of a moderator in a heterogeneous lgttice w1th molten selt fuels
is potentially advantageous. First, the approach to & thermal neutron spectrum
improves the neutron yleld, q, attainable, especially'with U235 and Pu 39
Second, in a heterogeneous syetem, the fuel is partially shielded from’neutrona
of intermediate energy, and a further improvement in effective'neutron yield, 1,
redults. Further, the optimum systems may prove to have smeller volumes of fuel
in the core than the corresponding flnorine-moderated homogeneous reactors and,
consequently, higher concentrations of fuel and thorium in the melt. This may
substantially reduce parasitic losses to components of the carrier salt. On
the other hand, these higher cancentrations tend to increase the inventory’in
the eirculating fuel system externsl to the core. The same considerations
apply'to fission products and to nonfissionable isotOpes of uranium.

Possible moderators for molten-salt reactors include beryllium, BeO, and

'graphite._ The design and performance of the Aircraft Reactor Experiment, a
‘beryllium oxide moderated eodium-zirconium fluoride salt one-region, U235

fueled burner reactor,has been reported (see Part 1) Since beryllium and BeO

and molten salte are ‘not chemically compatible, it was: neceSSery to line the

PART 5

EQUIPMENT FOR MOITEN-SALT REACTOR HEAT TRANSFER SYSTEMS

The equipment required in the heat transfer circuits of a molten;salt
reactor consists of the components needed to contain, circulate, cool, heat,
and control molten salts at temperatures up to 1300°F. Included in such
systems are pumps, heat exchangers, piping, expansion tanks, storage vessels,
valves, devices for sensing operating variables, and other auxiliary equipment.

Pumps for the fuel and blanket salts differ from standard centrifugal
pumpé for ‘operation at high temperatures in that provisions must be made to
exclude oxidants and lubricants from the salts, to prevent uncontrolled escape
of salté,and gases, and to minimize heating and irradiation of the drive motors.
Héat is transferred from both the fuel and the blanket salts to sodium in shell-
and-tube heat exchangers designed to maximize heat transfer Per unit volume and
to minimize the contained volume of salt - especially the fuel salt.

Seamless piping is used, where possible, to minimize flaws. Thermal
expansion is accomodated by prestressing the pipe and by using expansion loops
and joints. Heaters and thermal insulation are provided on all components
that contain salt or sodium for préheating and for maintaining the circuits
at temperatures above the freezing points of the liquids and to minimize heat
loésgs. Devices are provided for sensing flow rates, pressures, temperatures,
and liquid levels. The devices include venturi tubes, pPressure trﬁnsmitters,
thermocouples, electrical probes, and floats. Inert gases are used over free-
liquid surfaces to prevent oxidation and to apply appropriate base pressures
for suppressing cavitation or moving liquid or gas from one vessel to another.
| The deviations from standard practice required to adapt the various com-

ponents to the molten-salt system are discussed below. The schematic diagram
of a molten-salt heat transfer system presented in Fig. 5.1 indicates the |
relative positions of the various components. For nuclear oPeration,‘an off~
gas system is éupplied, as described in Part 1. The vapor condensation trap
indicated in Fig. 5.1 is required only on systems that contain Zth or a com-
parably volatile fluoride as a component of the molten salt.

1. PUMPS FOR MOLTEN SALTS

Centrifugal pumps with radial or mixed-flow types of impeller have been_
used successfully to eclirculate molten-salt fuels. The units built thus far
and those currently being developed have a vertical shaft which carries the
impeller at its lower end. The shaft passes through & free surface of liquid
to isolate the motor, the seals, and the upper bearings from direct contact
- with the molten salt. Uncontrolled escape of fission gases or entry of unde-
sirable contaminants to the cover gas above the free-liquid surface in the
pump are prevented either by the use of mechanical shaft seals or hermetic
enclosure of the pump and, if necessary, the motor. Thermal and radiation
shields or barriers are provided to assure. acceptable temperature and radia-

- tion levels in the motor, seal, and bearing areas. Liquid cooling of internal
pump surfaces is provided to remove heat 1nduced by gamma and beta radiation.

The principles used in the design of puﬁps for normal liquids are appli-
cable to the hydraulic design of a molten~-salt pump. Experiments have shown
that the cavitation performance of molten-salt pumps can be predicted from
tests made with water at room temperature. In addition to stresses induced
by normal thermal effects, stresses due to radiation must be taken into’
account in all phases of design.

The pump shown in Fig. 5.2.was developed for 2000-hr durability at very
low irradiation levels and was used in the'Aircraft Reactor Experiment for
circulating molten salts and sodium at flow rates of 50 to 150 gpm, at heads
up to 250 ft, and at temperatures up to 1550°F. These pumps have been vir-
tually trouble-free in operation, and many units in addition to those used
in the Aircraft Reactor Experiment have been used in developmental tests of
various components of molten-salt systems.

The bearings, seals, shaft, and impeller form a cartridge-type subassembly
thatris-removable from the pump tank after opening a single, gasketed Jeint a-
bove the liquid'levelQ The volute, suction, and discharge connections form
parts of the pump tank subassembly into which the removable cartridge is in-
serted. 'The,upper portion of the shaft and a toroidal area in the lower part
of the.bearing housing are cooled by circulating oil. Heat losses during
operation are reduced by thermal insulation. |

A

In a2ll the units bullt thus far nickel-chrome alloys have been used in
_the construction of all the high-temperature wetted parts of the pump to
minimize corrosion. The relatively low thermal conductivity and high strength
of such alloys permitted close spacing of the impeller and bearings and high
thermal gradients in the shaft. ' '

Thrust loads are carried at the top of the shaft by a matched pair of
| pfeloaded angular-contact ball bearings mounted face-to-face in order to pro-
vide the'flexibility required to a#oid.bindings and to accomodate thermsl
distortions. Either éingle—row ball bearings or a journal bearing caﬁ be
used successfully for the lower bearing. |

The upper lubricant-to-air and the lower lubricant-to-inert-gas seals
are similar, rotary, mechanical face-type seals consisting of a stationary
graphite member operating in contact with & hardened-steel rotating member.
The seals are olil-lubricated, and the leakage of oil to the process side is
approximately 1 to 5 cmB/day. This oil is collected in a catch basin and
removed from the pump by gas-pressure sparging or by gravity.

The accumulation of some 200,000 hr of relatively trouble-free test
operation in the temperature range of 1200 to lSOOoF with molten sglts and
liquid metals.as the circulated fluids has proved the adequacy of this basic
pump design with regard to the major prdbiem of thermally induced distortibns.
Four différent sizes and eight models of pumps have been used to provide flows
in the range of 5 to 1500 gpm. Several individual pumps have operated for
periods of 6000 to 8000 hr, consecutively, without maintenance.

1.1 TImprovements Desired for Power Reactor Fuel Pump ;

The bdsic.pump described above has bearings and seals that are oil-lubricated
and cdoled, and in some of the pumps elastomers have been used as seals between
parts. The pump of this type that was used in the ARE was designed for a rela-
tively low level of radiation and received an integrated dose of less than
5 x 108 r. Under these conditions both the lubricants and elastomers were
proved to be entirely satisfactory.

The fuel pump for s power reactor, however, must last for many years.

The radiation level aenticipated at the surface of the fuel is 105 to 106 r/hr.

Beta- and gamma-emitting fission gases will permeate gll aveilable gas space

above the fuel, and the daughter fission products will be depoéited on all

exposed surfaces. Under these conditioﬁs, the simple pump described ebove
would fail within a few thousand hours. |

- 208 -

C

 
 

 

 

 

Considerable improvement in the resistance of the pump and motor to
radiation can be achieved by relatively simple means. Iengthening the shaft
between the impeller and the lower motor bearing and inserting additional
shielding material will reduce the radiation from the fuel to a low level
at the lower motor bearing and the motor. Hblloﬁ, metal O-rings or another
metal gasket arrangement can be used to replace the elastomer seals. The
sliding seal just below the lower motor bearing, which prevents escape of
the fission-preduct gases or inleakage of the outside atmosphere, must be
lubricated to ensure continued operation. If oil lubrication is used,'
radiation may quickly cause coking. Various phenyls, or mixtures of them,
are much less subject to formation of gums and cokes under radiation and
could be used as lubricant for the seal and for the lower motor beariné;

This bearing would be of the friction type, for radial and thrust loads.

' These modifications would provide a fuel pump with an expected life of_the .
order of a year. With suitable provisions for remote maintenance and repair,
these simple and relatively sure improvemente would probably suffice for
power reactor operation. '

Three additional improvements, now being studied, should make possible
a fuel pump that will operate trouble-free throughout a very long life. The
first of these is a 'pilot bearing for operation in the fuel salt. Such a
bearing, whether of the hydrostatic or hydrodynamic design, would be com-
pletely unaffected.by radiation and would permit use of a long shaft so that

- the motor could be well shielded. A combined radial and thrust bearing just
below the motor rotor would be the only other bearing required. The second
improvement is a 1abyrinth type of gas seal to prevent escape of fission gases
up the sheft. There are no rubbing surfaces and hence no ‘need for lubricants,l
g0 there can be no radietion demege. “The third innovation is a hemispherical
gas-eushioned bearing to aet as ‘8 combined thrust end radial bearing. It
would heve the advantage of requiring no auxiliary lubrication supply, and it
would cedbine well. with the 1ebyrinth type of gas seal. It would, of couree,
be unaffected.by redietion, _;' :

1. 2 A Propoeed Fuel Pump

A punp design embodying these 1ast three feetures is shown in Fig. 5.3,
It is designed for operation at a temperature of 1200 F,Aaiflow rate of 24,000 gpm,

lubricated by the molten-salt fuel. The upper bearing, which is also of the
hydrostatic type; is cusﬁiohed‘by helium and serves also as a barrier against
passage of gaseous fission products into the motor. This bearing is hemi-
spherical to permit accomodation of thermally induced distortions in the
over-all pump structure. |

The principal radiation shielding is that provided between the source
and the area of the.motor windings. Iayers of beryllium and boron for neutron .
shielding and a heavy metal»for gamma radiation shielding are proposed. The
motor is totally enclosed in order to eliminate the need for a shaft seal. A
coolant is circﬁlated in the area outside the stator windings and between the
upper bearing and the shielding. Molten-salt fuel is circulated over the sur-
faces of these parts of the pump which are in contact with the gaseous fission

products to remove heat generated in the metal.
2. HEAT EXCHANGERS, EXPANSION TANKS, AND DRAIN TANKS

The heat exchangers, expansion tanks, and drain tanks mﬁst be‘especially
designed to fit the particular reactor system chosen. The design data of items
suitable for a specific reactor plant are described in Part 1. The special
problems encountered are the need for preheating all salt- and sodium-containing
components, for cooling the exposed metal surfaces in the expansion tank, and
for removing afterheat from the drain tanks. It has been found that the molten
salts behave as normal fluids during pumping and flow and that the heat transfer
coefficients can be predicted from the physical properties of the salts.

3. VALVES

The prdblems associated with valves for molten-salt fuels are the consis-

'tent alignment of parts during transitions from rocm temperature to 1200° F,

the selection of materials for mating surfaces which will not fusion-bond in

the salt and cause the valve to stick in the closed position, and the pro-

vision of a gas-tight seal.; Bellcws-sealed, mechanically operated, poppet

valves of the type shown in Fig. Se A have given reliable service in test systems.
A number .of corrosion- and fusion-bond-resistant materials for high-

temperature use were found_ﬁhrough exfehsive screening tests. Molybdenum

against tungsten or copper and several titanium or tungsten carbide-nickel
cermets mating with each other proved to be satisfactory. Valves with very
accurately machined cermet‘seats and poppets haue operated satisfactorily
in 2-in. molten-salt lines at 1300°F with leakage rates of legs than 2 cmB/hr.
Consistent positioning of the poppet and seat to assure leak tightness is
achieved by minimizing transmission of valve body distortions to the valve
stem and poppet. ' '

If rapid valve operation is not required, a simple "freeze" valve may
be used to ensure a leak-tight seal. The freeze valve consists of a section"
of pipe, usually flattened, that is fitted with a device to cool end freeze
e salt plug and another means of subsequently’heating and melting the plug.

L. SYSTEM HEATING

Molten-salt systems must be heated to prevent thermal shock during fill-
ing and to prevent freezing of the salt when the reactor is not operating to

‘produce power. Straight pipe sections are normally heated by an electric

tube-furnace type of heater formed of exposed Nichrome V wire in a ceramic
shell (clamshell heaters). A similar type of heater with the Nichrome V wire
installed in flat ceramic blocks can be used to heat flat surfaces or large
components, such as dump tanks, etc. In general, these heaters are satis-
factory for continuous operation at 1800°F, Pipe bends, irregular shapes,
and small components, such as valves and.pressureameasuring devices, are
usually heated with tubular heaters (e.g., General Electric Company "Calrods")
which can be. shaped to Fit the component or pipe bend. In general, this type
of heater should be limited to service at 1500 F. Care must be exercised in
the installation of tubular heaters to avoid failure due to a hot spot caused
by insulatioh in direct contact with the heater. This type of failure can be
avoidednby installing a thin sheet of metal (shim stock) between the heater

' and the insulation. ,"

Direct resistance heating in which an electric current is passed directly

:,through 8 section of the molten-salt piping has also been used successfully.

Operating temperatures of this type of heater are 1imited onlyiby the corrosion
and strength 1imitations of the metal as the temperature is increased. Experi -
ence has indicated that heating of pipe bends by this method is usually not
uniform and can be asccompanied by hot spots caused by nonuniformity of liquid
flow in the bend.

5. JOINTS

Failures of‘some system conponents may be expected during the desired

' operating life, say 20 years, of a molten- salt power-producing reactor, con-
sequently, provisions must be made for servicing or removing and replacing
such_components., Remotely controlled manipulations will be required because
there will be a high level of radiation within the primary shield. Repair
work on or preparations for disposal of components that fail will be carried
out in separate hot cell fac1lities. |

The components of the system are interconnected by piping, and flanged
connections or welded joints may be used, In breaking connections between a
component and the piping the cleanliness of the system must be preserved, and
in remaking a connection proper alignment of parts must be re-established.

The reassembled system must conform to the original leak-tightness sPecifica—
tions. Special tools and handling equipment will be needed to separate
components from the piping and to transport parts within the highly radio-
active regions of the system. While an all-welded system provides the highest
structural integrity, remote cutting of welds, remote welding, and inspection
of such welds are difficult operations. Speclal tools are being developed

for these tasks, but they are not yet generally available. Flanged connections,
which are attractive from the point of view of tooling, present problems of
permanence of their leak tightness.

Three types of flanged joints are being tested that show promise. One
is a freeze-flange joint that consists of a conventional flanged-ring joint
with a cooled annulus between the ring and the process fluid. The salt that
enters the annulus freezes and provides the primary sealy, The ring.provides_
a backup seal against salt and gas leakage. The annulus between the ring and
frozen materiasl can be monitored for fission product or other gas leakage. The
design of this joint is illustrated in Fig. 5.5.

A cast-metal-sealed flanged joint is also being tested for use in vertical
runs of pipe. As shown in Fig. 5.6, this joint includes a seal which is cast
in place in an annulus provided to contain it. When the connection is to be
made or broken the seal is melted. Mechanical strength is supplied'by clamps

or bolts.

A flanged joint containing a gasket (Fig. 5.7) is the third type of
Joint being considered. In this joint the flange faces have sharp, cir-
cular, mating ridges. The opposing ridges compress a soft metal gasket to
form the seal between the flanges.

6. INSTRUMENTS

Sensing devices are required in moltenJSalt systems for the measurement
of flow rates, pressures, temperatures, and liquid levels. Devices for these
services are evaluated according to the following criteria: (1) they must be
of leak-tight, preferably allewelded, construction; (2). they must be capable
of operating at maximum tempersture of the fluid system; (3) their acouracies
must be relatively unaffected by changes in the system temperature; (4) they
should provide lifetimes at least as great as the lifetime of the reactor;
(5) each must be constructed so that, if the sensing element fails, only the
measurement supplied by it is lost. The fluid system to which the instrument
is attached must not be jeopardized by failure of the sensing element.

6.1 TFlow Measurements

Flow rates are measured in molten—salt systems with orifice or venturi
elements. The pressures developed across the sensing element are measured
by comparing the outputs of two pressure-measuring devices. Magnetic flow-
meters are not at present sufficiently sensitive for molten-salt service
because offthe,poor'electrioal_conduotivitj of the salts.

6.2 Pressure Measurements . -

Measurements of system pressures require that transducers operate at g
safe margin above the melting point of the salt, and thus the minimum trans-
' ducer operating temperature is usually about 1200° F. ‘The pressure transducers "~
that are available are of two types (1) a pneumatic fOrce-balanced unit and
(2) a displacement unit in which ‘the pressure is sensed by displacement of a
Bourdon tube or. diaphragm. The pneumatie force-balanced unit has the disadvan-
teges that loss of the instrument gas supply (usually air) can result in loss ‘
of the measurement and that failure of the bellows or diaphragm would open the
process system to the alr supply or to the atmosphere. The displacement unit,

on the other hand, makes use of an isolating fluid to transfer the sensed
pressure hydrostatically to an isolatedzlow-temperature output element.. Thus,
in the event of a failure‘of-the_primary diaphragm, the trocess fluid would
merely mix with the isolating fluid and:the closure of the syetem would be
unaffected. | o

6. 3 Temperature Mhasurements

Temperatures in the range of 800 to 1300 F are commonly measured with
Chromel-Alumel thermocouples or platinum-platinum-rhodium thermocouples. The
accuracy and life of a thermocouple in the temperature range of interest are
functions of the wire size, and, in general, the largest p0381ble thermocouple
should be used. Either beaded thermocouples or the newer, magnesium oxide-

insulated thermocouples may be used.

6.4 Iiquid-Ievel Measurements

Instruments are available for both on-off and continuous level measure-
ments. On-off measurements are made with modified automotive-type spark plugs
in which 8 long rod is used in place of the normal center conduc¢tor of the
spark plug.  In order to obtain a continuous level measurement, the fluid head
is measured with a differential pressure instrument. The pressure required to
bubble a gas into the fluid is compared with the pressure above the liquid to
obtain the fluid head. Resistance probe and float types of level-indicators
are available for uee in liquid-metal systems. |

6.5 Muclear Sensors ,

Nuelear sensors for molten-salt reactors are. similar to. those of other
reactors and are not required to withstand high temperatures. Existing and
'well-tested fission, ionizatiOn, and ‘oron trifluoride ‘thermal-neutron detec-
tion chaﬁbers ere available for installation at all points essential to reactor
| ioperation.; Their disadvantages of limited life can be countered only'by dupli-
 cation or replacement and provisions can’ be’ made for this. It should be
;pointed out that the relatively large, negative, temperature coefficients of
reactivity provided by'most circulating-fuel reactors, make these instruments
unessential to the routine operation of the reactor. ‘

PART 6
BUILDUP OF NUCLEAR POISONS AND METHODS OF CHEMICAL PROCESSING

~ Even though nearly pure 1?2 or 177 is used as the initial fuel
- for & reactor, undesireble products quickly build up as & result of
the fissioo.process. First, each uranium nucleus thet undergoes fis-
'sion'splits into two "fission product"” elements. The'fission products
are‘nuclear poisons to vanying degrees that depend on_their_atamio- _
number and mass-and on the mean neutron‘energy of the reactor. A sec-
ond source of poison is the even-numbered isotopes of uranium, which.
are not fissioneble. A certain emount of U2 is fed, along with the
177, even in highly enriched uranium, and ‘as the U727, with its high
neutron absorption cross sectioﬁ,»is burned out, the percentage of
U238 rises. Simllarly, a certain fraction, a, of the captures in the
fissionable isotopes results in radiative ‘capture of the neutrons, and,
instead of fissioning, the next higher uranium isotope (UEBLL 256)
is formed. It is necessary to examine the rates and extent to which
these updesirable constituents build up so that changes in neutron

or U

economy may be understood and so that desirable chemical reprocessing
rates may be determined.

1. BUILIUP OF EVEN-MASS-NUMBER URANIUM ISOTOPES

The buildup of U222, 12, 1220, and UP>® as nonfissionsble iso-

topic diluents in U233 and U235 is, as stated above, significant in |
fuel cycle economics. Although_U232 does not bulld up enough to af-
fect the neutron balence significantly, its hard-gamma-emitting
daughters are produced fast enough to be a biological hazard in the
handling of U255 and thus adversely affect the resale value of the
U253.l It has been assumed that & molten-salt reactor will process

isotopes, end none seems feasible , the 0231} builds up until it is be-
ing produced and burned at the same rate. Based on cross sections
for neutrons at a velocity of 2200 m/sec, as taken from BNL-325
(cf 25 532, a 23 = 0.10, o ih - 92), & thermal reactor at steady state
would have ~ 58% as much U234 as U233 with 025 capturing ~9% as
many neutrons as 0253 In the epithermal mol‘ben-salt reactor de-
scribed in part 1 and hereafter called the reference-design reactor
(a 23 ny_ 0.16, o, 25 / o’eu. ~s 4.67), the steady-state 023lP concentra-
tion is ~75% of the U255 concentration, with U23 absorptions equal

to ~14% of the 023 3 absorptions. Neutron capture in 02 produces
fissionable 0255 but capture in thorium would be preferable ) since
U25 5 is a better fuel than 0255

Rediative capture in ye?? yields 1125 6 which may be considered
~to be an isotopic poison, since neutron absorption in U23 6 effective~

tor (o7 = 0. 19, a/ = 582, 5-26 s Te5), the v22% yould build up
until :I.t was present to the exbent. of ~15 times the amount of 023 >
with v 6 capturing ~16% as many neutrons as 2, Normally, in
any actual thermal reactor, resonence captures in U25 6 will reduce
the steady-state ratio of U0 to 0235 to less then 15. In the epi-
thermal reference-design rea.c'bor (a o 0.k, '0’25/“‘ 26_ ~ 1.3),
the U‘?5 would build up only to NSO% of the 1123 5 at steady state,
but ab that point the 1323 6 would be capturing N}O% a.s many neutrons
as U 3 5 . Isotopic separation of Ua3 5 and 023 6 may be feasible in a

probably a realistic assumption, since the fuel becomes a mixture of

For a steady-state reactor operating with highly enriched 023 5
feed (e.g., 93% 0255 6% 0238 1% U23h) without any isotopic reprocess-
ing, the U2‘7’8 at steady-state will capture 6/93 as meny neutrons as the

2. PROTACTINIUM AND NEPTUNIUM POISONING

Neutron capture in pa’dd or Np239' has the same result as nonfission

capture in 1123 5 or Pu 59 i.e., & fiseiona:ble atom is effectively lost,
as well as & neutron. Although neutron loss to Np 231 does not involve
loss of & fissionsble atom, this loss can be more important than losses
to Pa®>> end Np-~” in reactors fed with highly enriched U-~”, Although
neutron capture by eny of these three isotopes yields a fertile atom,
at present prices for fertlile and fissile materials the gain is negli-
gible compared with the loss.

design molten-salt reactor, processed at the rate of once per year, |
Np257 polsoning is zero.initially;:dbout'ogs% after one year, about
2% after 20 years, and sbout 2.5% at steady state.

3. FISSION PRODUCT POISONING

A 600-Mw reactor operating at a load factor of 0.80 will produce
about 183 kg/yr of fission products. About 22 atom percent of these
fission products have decay chains such that they appear as krypton
or xenon isotopes with half-lives of 78 min or more and thus are sub-
Ject to physical removal from a molten-salt reactor as rare gases by
purging with helium or nitrogen. These "removable" fission products
contribﬁte'dbout 26% of the total'fission broduct poisoning at 100 ev.
(Eor half-lives of 3 min or more, the yield'and poisoning percentages
-~ are 30 and 31, respectively. For half-lives of 1 sec or more the
velues are Ll and 38%, respectively.) The comparable poisoning per-
centage in a thermal reactor is much higher because of ‘the very large
thermal neutron absorption cross sectig? of Xe 35.' In a thermal re-

actor, however, burnout limits the Xe poisoning to & meximum of
about 5%, while in a resonance reactor ad jacent nuclei do not have
greatly differing cross sections, and burn-out is relatively ineffec-
tive in limiting total poisoning. Thus, to a first approximation, in
resonance reactors poilsoning increases almost linearly with time if

fission products are not removed.

About 26 atom pércent of the long-lived fission products are
rare earths. At 100 ev they contribute sbout 40% of the total fis-
sion product poisoning. The remaining ru52% of the fission products
contributes ~hl% of poisoning at 100 ev and comprises a wide variety
of elements, no one of which is outstandlng from the nuclear poisoning
point of view.

.poisoning (o1, 2%) rlus the ‘contribution from ell other fission pro-
~ducts. From data.presented in ORNL-2127 (ref. 4) for thermal 0255

burners operated at constant power and constant U‘?35 inventory, with
no fission product removel, the poisoning from “all other fission
products” is calculated to be ~3% at 100% burnup (i.e., when the
total amount of U235'burnea is equal to the "2 inventory), ~19%
at 1000% burnup, and ~51% at 10,000% burnup. - Thus it is possible,
although not necesserily economicel, to run & thermel, fluid-fueled
reactor for many years without processing thé fuel to remove fission
product poisons. The penalties for not processing would'be higher
U255 inventory charges and lower breeding-conversion ratios. At &
load factor of 0. 80, a 600-Mw thermal reactor burns sbout 218 kg of

35 per year (183 kg fissioned, 35 kg converted into U236), and
therefore with a L36-kg U-35 inventory the fission product poisoning
would incresse from O to 5% initislly end then to 20 to 25% after
20 years.

| Even in thermal reactors, resonance captures in fission products
make the poisoning somewhat worse than the nubers given above. The
megnitude of the extre poisoning depends on the ratio of the neutron
flux at resonance energies to the thermal neutron flux, which is de-
termined in part by the effectiveness of the moderator. In resonance
reactors, the flssion product poisoning is considersbly worse than in
thermal reactors because of the higher average fission product ebsorp-
tion cross—section relative to U235 " At & load factor of 0.80, a 600-Mw
reactor using 100-ev neutrons would burn about 275 kg of 0235 per yeer

— (183 kg fissioned, 92 kg converted into U256 - In such e reactor with
. an inventory of 550 kg of U25 the fission product poisoning would
'increase approximately 1inearly from zero, initially, to AJ52% after

2 years. S

For U233-fueled reactors, the fission product poisoning is about
the seme as for U‘?35 in thermal reactors, but in the resonance region
| the higher U233 cross section reduces the poisoning effect‘by & factor
of 2 compared with U255. Thus & lOO-eV'breeder-converter burning half-"
end-half U235 and U235 would have a fission product poison level of
~6% if the fuel were processed at the rate of twice per (100%) burnup.

 

The reference-design molten-salt reactor has & medien fission |
energy of n10 ev, with ~10% of the fissions at thermal energles. It
may be considered, to a first approximation, that sbout one-third of
| the fissions are at thermal energy and sbout two-thirds are at an ener-

 

gy of 100 ev, for comparison'with the analyses presented above. At a
losd factor of 0.80, the 600-Mw resctor will bumn 105 kg of U and
n:125 kg of ye? per year, and it will produce ~ 183 kg of figsion pro-
ducts, m13 kg of u2 , and m3h kg of 11236 It should be processed at
a rate of three to four times per 100% burnup, and the total fission
product poisoning will be 6 to 8%.

L, CORROSION%PRODUCT POISONING

Chemical analyses of fuel mixtures circulated in INOR-8 and Inconel
loops have indicated that the principal corrosion-product poisons will
be the fluorides of chromium, iron, and nickel. These are relatively
light elements and,.per atom, their capture cross sections in the reson-
ance region are lower than those of the fission products. Further, ex-
trapolations of short-time tests indicate that the concentration of the
corrosion products will be much lower than that of the fission products.
Corrosion produot poisoning'has therefore been neglected.

5. METHODS FOR GHEMICAL PROCESSING

The "ideel" reactor chemical processing scheme would remove fission
products, corrosion products, Pa233,rnp237, and Np 239 as soon as they
were formed. After the Pa 255 and the Np239 had decayed to U233 and Pu 59
they would be returned to the reactor {or sold), along with the urenium
and plutonium that would also be recovered in the process. This ideal

chemical plant would have low cepital and operating costs, would hold

- 226 ~

 

 
 

 

up only smell amounts of fissioneble eand other high-priced materials,
‘and would discharge its waste streams in forms that could be inex-
pensively disposed of or, possibly, sold as by—prodnctssrlPresent
technology, however, . does not offer such an ideal pro cess for sny

reactor.

More practical goals for processing a molten-galt reactor are
(1) continuous removel of most of the gaseous fission products by
purging the fuel with helium or nitrogen ges; (2) an in-line removal
of rare earth, noble metel, or other. fission products by freezing-out
part of the selt streem, pleting out fission products on metallic
surfaces (either naturelly or electrolyticelly), exchenging the reare
earths for Zcerium, or scavenging by contacting the salt with & solid
~such as BeO to remove certa.in constituents of the salt by edsorption :
or exnhenge, &nd (3) continuous or batch removal of the salt from
the resctor &t an cconomically qptimum.rate to seperate the uranium,
plutonium, end selt from the remaining fission products and corrosion_
products by the least expensive method availeble. Present technology
does not make all these methods immediately eveildble, but there is
. reason to expect that continuation of the current development program
would make them eveilsble in the nineteen~sixties. ’

development programs, but for the present 'mol‘beh—salt rea;ctoif s'tlidy'
it is assumed that only the uranium will be recovered from the salt
by the ORNL fluoride volatility process and that the salt will be
stored for future recovery of thorium and lithium. Adequate tech-
nology already exists for the preparation of fresh fuel stafting
with nonradioactive UF6 and fluoride salts, and methods for remote
reconstitution of fuel from recycled uranium (snd recycled salt,

1f possible) are being developed.

5+l.  The Fluoride Volatility Process

A program of development and pilot-plant demonstration of a
fluoride volatﬂity process for recovering uranium from molten
fluoride salts by oxidation with F2 to form UF6 is currently under |
wey. Recovery of the uranium in the slightly radioactive ARE fuel
(Na.F-ZrFu—UF,_l_) was completed in February 1958., and a demonstra‘bion» )
of the recovery of uranium from a highly radioactive STR fuel ele=-
ment (which, first, will Be_di’ssolved in NeF-ZrF) in the presence
of HF) is scheduled for fiscal year 1959. A blo"ck flow sheet of
the process as adapted for molten-salt reactor fuel i'eprocéssing
is shown in Fig. 6.1. The uranium-bearing molten salt is trans-
‘ferred to the fluorination vessel in batches. Fluorine, diluted
‘with N , is bubbled through the salt st 450°C until its U content

2
is reduced to ~10 ppm. The UF6, N, and excess F,. pass out of the

fluorinator through a 100°C NaF pellet bed, wh:i.charemoves the UF
from the gas stream. In the pilot plant the excess F2 is disposed
of by scrubbing it with a reducing KOH solution, but in a production
Plant the fluorine might well be recycled to the fluorination step.
The UF6 is desorbed from the NaF bed by raising the temperature of
the bed to LOO°C and sweeping it with more F,-N,. The UF, then

- passes through a second NaF bed and finally is collected in cold
traps at -40 to -60°C. The volatility plent product is ligquid UF
obtained by isolating the cold traps from the system, heating to

gbove the triple point, and draining into the product receiver.

- Most of the decontemination in the voletility process is achieved

in the fluorination step, since most of the fission end corrosion pro=-
ducts remain in the salt. The volatile conteminants (Xe, Kr, I, Te, Mo,
most of the Ru, end part of the Nb end Zr) either pass through the NeF
‘bed while the UF¢ is retained or remein on the bed when the UF6 is de-
sorbed (Nb, Zr). The I, Te, Mo and Ru are removed almost entirely by a
cold trap, and the remainder is scrubbed out of the gas system along
ﬂ_with the excess F2 The Xe and Kr follow the N to the plant off-gas- |

system. The Nb end Zr slowly'build up on the NeF bed, which is replaced_
vhen poisoned. Replacement is infrequent, however, because a micrometal-
lic nickel filter between the fluorinator end NaF bed removes most of the
Nb and Zr.

| The ARE fuel was processed in batches of 1.k ft3 of salt, each batch
containing w10 kg of U-2” (the capaclty of the NaF beds), at the rate of
two batches per week. The not-economically-recoverable uranium losses

in processing the ARE fuel were approximately 0.015% in the waste salt
and O. 075% on the NeF beds.

The reference-design molten-galt reactor includes a volatility plant
approximately the same size as the ORNL pilot plant. About the seame
uranium processing rate is planned (two 10-kg batches per week through
the NeF beds), but & higher salt throughput rate (2 £t°/day each of
fuel and blanket fluid) will be used because of the lower uranium con-

throughput rate is within the capabilitlies of the present ORNL pilot
plant, which could fluorinate one 1.k ft3 batch per shift, if necessary.
For the molten-salt reactor processing plent, separate fluorinators of

Cross contaminetion and require only one fluorinetion per day for each.

The possibility-of continuous fluorinstion and the consequent re-
‘duction in the size of the equipment are being considered. In addition,

5.2. K-25 Process for Reduction of UFg to UFy

 

The continuous, reduétion of highly' enriched. UF6 to _UFM_ is__wgli
proved as a nonradioactive proc:eesss.5 The process, used and developed |
at K-25, is indicated in Fig. 6.13 the UF product from the volatility
process is the feed mate:ial. The reduction takes place in a U"E'6-F2-H2
flame in a Y-ghaped reactor. The Fa is added to give the proper fleme
temperature. The reaction products are UF,+ and I-IF-HQ gas. Micrometal-
lic filters are used to recover eny UFI;. wvhich may be entrained in the
exlt gas. A vibrator 1s used to shake free any UFh which clings to
the filter or tower walls. A chemicel trap with a t',‘z?:..'i'xclL or an NaF
pellet bed 1s used to recover any unreacted UF6 in the exit gases,
although the amount so collected is negligibly small in normal oper-
ation. The HF in the exit gas is either scrubbed with a KOH solution
spray or sorbed on an NaF bed. |

This process has not been used a‘b 8 high level of radioactivity.

,S-:ane the UF6 from the molten-salt reactor volatility plant will be

somewhat radiocactive » the major actiﬂty probebly being II23 T , & pilot
plant demonstration will be required, but no serious difficulties are
anticipated. For the molten-salt reactor chemicel plant, Vequipment

of the same size as that used in the ‘K—-25 facility is assumed. A fa-
cility of this Size would have excess capacity on a continuous basis,
but it is essumed that it would be operated intermittently, probebly
on ;thé once-or-twice-a-week schedule 'fv'.'sed.' for the discharging of the

UF from the voletility plent NeF beds.

Lithilm'_fluoride is quite. soluble in anhydrous HF end quite in-

soluble in H20. By itself, BeF is Just the opposite, elthough its

solubility in HF is significantly increased by first saturating the

HF with LiF. A small emount of water in the: EE‘ also lncreases the
2

elements end some fission products, including the rare earths, are

insoluble in both solvents.

 The solubility of the 63 mole % LiF-37 mole % BeF fuel carrier
salt mixture is greater than 100 g/kg in ~90% HF. In an experiment
in iwhich mixed fission products (rare earths, strontium, and c.es.iunjl)
were added to the salt mixture and the mixture was dissolved and
filtered, the salt was decontaminated from rare earths by & factor
of ~1000; that is, the activity remaining in the salt was 1/1000
of the activity of the mixture prior to dissolution. No decontami-

nation from cesium was obtained. The results for strontium were inecon-

clusive, but the decontamination_ appeared to be intermedisate between
that from rare earths and that from cesium.-

In further studies, fission product and heavy element solubili-~

ties will be investigated, as well as possible hydrolysis of the
s’_alt by reaction of the salt with water in the solvent. | It may'be_

found possible to avoid hydrolysis of the salt byusing aphydrous HF

or to overcome it by trea.ting the reclaimed. salt with HF.

rare earth, possibly cerium, has also been initiated. The process
might be carried out in either of two ways. First, the salt might
be saturated with ~1 mole % cerium at an elevated temperature, end
then cooled to within ~30°C of the liguidus temperature of the pure
selt, at which temperature the rare earth golubility is only 0.2,
Thus ~80% of the cerium would precipitate and carry with it ~80%
of the fission product rare earths. After a solid-liquid separation,
~this process could be repeated, if desired, to give high-percentage
removal of fission product rare earﬁhs. Second, & perhaps better
way to'accomplish the same end wnuld'be to cool the core salt to
near its liquidus temperature and éontact it with solid CeFj, prob-
ably in a columnar bed of pellets. In principle, the fission pro-
duct rare earths could.be‘exchanged'for cérium to ahy desired extent
in this menner, depending on the ratio of salt to cerium used, ‘the
pellét size (determining the surface area), and the contact time.

The attractiveness of the éxchange process is enhanced by the
low ebsorption cross section of cerium compared with the sbsorption
cross sections of most fission product rare earths. This potential. -
advantage is reduced somewhat for e reasonsble processing rate, in
that, effectively, several cerium atoms are exchanged for one fission
product iare earth atom, since the ceriuﬁ solubility is ~ 0.2 mole %
near the liquidus temperature, whereas the fission-product rare earth
concentration in the core salt is only ~0.04k% for a processing rate
of once per year (and proportionately less for shorter processing
perlods, as would be desirable given an economical processing method).

In the reference-design moltenésalt reactor the advantage is :educed'

further by the fact that for resonance-energy neutrons the cerium

cross section is not as much lower than the cross sections of the

other rare earths as it is at thermal energies (see Table 6,1). Thus

‘&t 100 ev the poisoning due to 0.2% cerium would be equal to that from | .
| fissiOnQProduct'rare earths for & processing rate of once per six |
months, iQe., the total would be equivalent to fission-product rare .

- 5.5. Radioa.ctive Ws.ste Disposal

At 8 load factor of 0.80, 600-Mw reactor will produce ~183. kg/y'r
of fission products, About 23 wt % of the fission products cen be re-
moved as Xe-Kr gases, but the remaining ~1hl kg/yr must be removed by
chemical processing The chemical processing waste streams include

fused salt 5 NeF pellets ’ 2 N2 s and I-IF--H2 gases, Most of the nongaseous

: fission products rema.in in the fuel salt residue a.fter fluorination and.
ms.y be stored in this form. Most of the rema.ining fission products are

removed by periodically flushing out the micrometallic filter between
the fluorinator and the NeF bed and the cold trap between the NaF bed
and the F, disposal unit. The NaF bed is replaced infrequently, if and
vhen it becomes poisoned with niobium and zirconium. Any remaining
fission products in the gas streams are scrubbed out with the F2 and
HF, or vented to the reactor off-gas system.

For optimum costs, high-power molten-salt reactors should have
moderately high inventories of enriched uranium and the fuel should
be proces_sed about tiwlce per fuel-inventory burnup, & compromise be- |
tween the rate-proportional cost of processing (assumed e,t present to
be equsl to the cost of buying new salt) and the savings due to im-

'proved regenera.tion ratio made possible by processing If a fission- |
-~ ‘eble ms.terial inventory of 600. kg or more and a fuel ‘processing rate
B V'of once per year or greater are assumed and it is considered that

the fuel selt will be discarded after its uranium is removed by the
voletility process , the wa.ste salt volume amounts to 600 f't5 per |
year or more (sbout 1 ft /Mw-year, or 1 £t / kg of fissionsble mater-

ia.l processed, or 3 to 4k £t /kg of total fission products) - This

- 236 -
 

 

 

volume is quite 1ow in comparison with the wastes of other power
reac'bors s for example, STR wastes are ~90 f‘b3 /kg of U23 2 processed
in the present agueous process and ~3 ft3 /kg of U23 > in the proposed
volatility process, and the figures are gbout 4 times larger on &
cubic foot per kilogram of fission products basis. |
