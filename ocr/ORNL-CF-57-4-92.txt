MAINTENANCE OF VARIOUS REACTOR TYFES

UNCLASSIFIED

 

I. INTRODUCTION N R

: It has been & common prectice in the past to investigate maintenance tech-

‘niques and relsted equipment efter many reactor features were esteblished. This

is especiallyftrue of some of the experimental end reseerch reactors; the operation
and mintenance of which unfortunately comprise most of our ectual knowledge in
thie field; @ese reactors did not have as their objective the demonstration of
meintenance feaeibility. With this in mind, it cen be seen that meny proposed
power reactorémaintenance concepts are Just what the name implies; idems, that
may or may not be prectical until tried out under at least simlated reactor
operating conditions . |
In the abeence of predecessors in most cacges upon which plant layout and

design may be :‘be.sed, it has been necessary to establish certein rules in order
that these processes may proceed while further development work is done on compon-
ents and concepts. There are certain basic maintemance fundamentels that ere common
to all types of reactors that may be incorporated in s power producing \fecility.
The various coh:ponents of en ideal system '.should be Lérouped end related in such
a monner that the maintenance of .th'e ‘equipment is éadily accomplished. In
adﬂition, the system should 'be convenient for operation and require & minimmn of
manpower and cepital outlay to achieve the desired ob,jectives.‘ It can be seen then
the necessity of mking an early study of maintena.nce procedures in order that the

sulting design will produce & program integrated and ‘ba.lanced with other features

of the pla.nt.- For this reason, & prima.ry pla.nt mintena.nce philosophy should be

. developed at the ‘beginning of the layout work.

II. TYPES OF MATNTERANCE ) | |

| Basically;_there are only two types _of mintenence procedures. The direct
type, which iszconﬁnon to conirentional steam plents,. mey be used ih some areas
where the redioa.ctivity level 1is low enough In most parts of the plant, main-

tenance w:l.ll of necessity be remote due to the high level of radioactivity.

IINBMSSIHEB

"Remote maintenance may be further subdivided into "wet” or "dry."

In the "wet“ remote type of meintenance, after the equipment is shut down and

:d.ra.ined, the a.rea is flooded -the roof removed e.nd maintenance is done by tools '
with long extension handles looking down through 1'5 or 20 feet of weter. However,
a d.isadvanta.ge ig that where & piping system must be opened d.uring maintenance

| ‘operations there is alweys the possibility that the shielding water can enter and

contemt nate the system.

With “drjr" remote maintenance, after the equipment is shut down and drained,

....

»ma.nipuletors mounted. on cranes or remote tools operated from behind mobile 1ee.d

shields are used. However, the present development of remote dry maintenance has

" been 1 very limited.. In the pest, decontemination and direct maintenance have been

relied upon to permit repair of equipment, but in & 500 mw hémogeneous plant,

for ememple ’ ra.dia.tion levels of 106 roentgen can be expected in some areas, thus

the inacces sihility for direct maintenance.

III. APPLICATION
For simplicity of description in this report, all reactor types are divided

into two general.claeses, 1.e., solid fuel %ypes‘and circulating fuel types. It
;shall be our pnrpose to examine the verious reactor types in each classiﬁcetion
for progress, fee.si'bility and problems still feced by the design in question.

'A. Solid. Fuel '.l‘ypes
In general, 1t may be said that solid fuel type reactors are easier to

'minta.in than circu.‘l.sting fuel types.. This is due, of course, to the retention

of the fission fragments and poisons within the cladding of the fuel elements.

However, some isolid fuel reactors are more difficult to maintain than others.

Examples are the 'boiling water reactors which due to steem sctivation and the
presence of activated impurities and radicactive non-condensibles ( El6 and Ahl)

in the coolant meke maintene.nce of the primary loop impossible during operation,

-and the sodiwn cooled reactors which contain highly active Na~ upon irradiation

of the coola.nt.
1. Gas -Cooled Reactors
An integrel part of maintenance on solid-fuel reactors is fuel

handling associated wvith charging end discharging 'bhe unit at per:l.odic intervals.

:This fuel handling equipment must be highly reliable since failure of certain

‘components may be very costly. Handling equipment is subjected to severe environ-

mental conditions. In addition, the equipment must be resistant to radiation

attack.

Wi‘hh the exception of the Savannah River Rea.ctor, most experience

‘has been gained on charging reactors having horizontal channels for fuel elements.

At Calder Ha.l]_. the channels are vertical and blind at the bottom, thus charging

and d_.ischarg:i.ng must be accomplished from the top. Two mobile charging machines

and two 'dischs;rging machines are provided for each reactor. The machines are

electrieally ﬁropelled end carry a winch end en electrically operated grab for

'ra.ising end lovering the fuel elements. When the magazine of the discharge machine
1s ioaded w:l.th spent fuel elements, it moves to & ecircular well through which the
-nilagazine is loiwered to ground level and deposited in a shielded flask for trans-
_poft.a.tion to the storage pond. The time required for the charge end digcharge of
‘one group of 1+ channels is about 1 1/% hours. There are six fuel elements per

fchannel a.nd. a 'hota.l of 1696 channels to give some :I.dea of the work involved.

At an early stage of the Ca.lder Hall design, it was decldsd that

itime did not permit 'bhe development of & system that would permit charging end
idischarging the reactor wh:lle running at full pwer, thus the operation 1is performed

‘e.'b shutdown a.nd. vith the un:l.t depressurized.

A hazerd that must be guarded against in the operation of a solid

fuel type ree.cfcor is the possi'bil:l.ty of a fuel element failure which ygn}g }_jelease

fission produ@ts into the coolant 'system and ereate radistion hazards in the portion

of -the plant occupied by operating personnel. ths would, of course, add con-
slderable conplications,in the maintenance of epmponents in the coolant circuit.

At Calder Hall each of the 1696 fuel chanmels is provided with a stainless steel

- tube which ‘bleeds off a small portion of the gas passing through the channel and

carries it to monitoring devices vhich detect the presence of the released fission
products. For the first 8 months of operation, only 2 slug fallures have occurred
which is much lower than predicted.

Thus the complete system of burst slug detection and fuel replece-
ment,if somewhat cumbersome and leborious, is also quite reliable which was the
desiﬂ-ed goal.é "

~ An important feature of gas-cooled reactors from both design and
main}tenance sta.ndpoints is the i‘reedom to use mild carbon steels throughout the
reac]tor, hest exchanger and ductwork systems This results from the use of clean,
non-corrosive gs.s coolent. |

For the proposed gas-cooled sta.tions to be bhullt :Ln Gres.t Britein,

the most significent advance in new designs is the introduction of fuel changing

under load. It has been postulated that this a.bility to charge end di scharge

fuel elements under full 1oad and without any interruption to the operation of the

plant may prove to be one of the most :I.mportent factors in establishing the

superiority of the gas-cooled reactor over other designs. At present, one of the

:most serious obdections to the designs of 1iquid cooled reactors is the need to

shut down in order to chs.nge fuel elements. 'I'his-is due to the h:l.gh operating

" Apressure of liq_uid cooled reaétors. |

'.Ehree of the four new designs utilize 8 conventional top loeding,
however, it is proposed by the GEC-Simon Carves group to 1oad the I-hmterston

plent (e 300 mr electric stetion) from the bottom of the remctor. This design

-coupled with charging a.nd discharging under full load conditions represents quite

an edvance over the Calder Hs.ll design.\

In genersl, maintenance of a gas-cooled réactor‘plant is feasible

 pince the radiation is kept below toleréncé-levels throughout most of the plant,

and the burst-slug detection equipment should enable removal of & defective

| elemant,befofe‘any serious contamination occurs. With the new designs, the gas-

cooled reactors are placed in an even more favorable light as far as maintenance

- is concerned.

2.  Organic Resctors
| Organic cooled and moderated reactors offer several advantages as
far as pqwer%reactors are~éoncernEd. First, the lack of acti}ation of‘the coolént
in conjunctiqn'with a good purification system could eliminate all secondary

shielding. Secqnd, the low vapor pressure of organics which are being considered

~ for the coolant and.modérator results in reduced thickness of pressure véss&l and

piping wall. 4Third, the relatively low corrosiﬁeness.and good lubricating
propert;es ofjdiphenyl have been confirmed and this considerably simplifies the
materisl prdbiems by eliminating the customarily required stainless stéels(l).

~ One important uncertainty in this system is the rate at which the
organic would;have to be replaced es a result of thermal and radiation damage. In

any event, the stability limitations of the most radietion stable organic materials

~are such thai]a purification system must bé a part of any reactor design. This
:damage of the%orgapic is noted because of the possibility of deposition on heat
transfer sﬁrféces'df the products of decomposition. However, tests by the
:California'Reéearch Corporation(z) 1nd1caté that‘po épprécidble-depositioﬁ occurs
?until a'pointiof consi§erablé decomposition is reached.‘ The purificétion system

:should preven£ this occurrence.

§ MaintenanceawiSe"this reactor concept_is_pfomisihg. Centrifugal

pumps with shaft seals cen be used-since the coolant is non-radiocactive and leakage

is not a problem. This of course permits the use of conventional style pumps with
théir greaterfbackground'of operstional and maintenance experience. The use of

commercially available carbon steel pipe will result in initial savings on fabri-

 cation plus easier maintenance after the plant is in operation.

A plate~fin type heat exchanger has been proposed for application
in an organic\reactor. The low pressure on both primary and secondary sides of

the reactor nake this-feasible. Advantages claimed for this type of unit are im-

- proved heat transfer, lower’fabnication costs as a result of eliminating large

pressure shells,'and trouble~free operation:since all critical'welds, those which

“would allow fluid to escape, are on the outside and readily accessible for repair.

The signi‘ficantly lower welght of the plate-fin type heat exchanger should result
in easier replacement of units should a gross feilure occur.

7 A disadvantage of an organic moderated and cooled reactor system is
the need for%a heating system to prehest the loop. However, the melting point of
diphenyl‘is 156°F which is considerably lower than the melting point of sodium

and some of the fused salts used in other reactor types, and therefore should

7 present probiems of no greater magnitude than are faced.by‘these‘types.

Only limited date is available costwise on operation and maintenance

of an organic moderated reactor. For a 12.5 mv plant, operation and maintenance

have been estimated to be 2.7 mills/kvh.
\ In summary, an organic reactor plant should be one of the easier

types to maintain for the following reasons ; accessibility to components since

- extensive shielding is not required; use of conventional pumps ; ‘use of low pressure

| carbon steel piping and components, and the possible application of conventional

maintenance procednres to a large part of the plant.
3. Pressurized.Water Reactors

A typical layout for 8 pressurized'water reactor consists of a |

reactor and a number of cireulating coolant 1oops. Eme PWR, for example, has four

coolant loops each 1ocated in & shielded‘compartment(s); The shielding is

'designed to'provide radiation protection, from adjacent loops and the reactor cell,

to personnel ﬁho may be inside the compartment engaged in maintenance work. All

The installstion of hyd.raulic a.nd. na.:msl stop velves in each inlet

- and outlet pipe provides double protection for personnel performing maintenance

‘work on & d.eiressurized and 'd.econtamino.ted.‘ coole.nt 1oop. In addition’, dra.in

lines &are provid.ed. between es.ch get of d.ouble stop va.lves to reveel any leak through

Any loop ma.y be drained. separately into the discharge system.

- the loop canpartment and isolate the loop by means of the manue.l stop valves.

Thus d.irect ma.intenance is possible on & 1a.rge portion of the circulating coolant

loops. Accessibility to the core may be prov_'ided. by & water shield over the pressure

| vessel » which is d.rained during operation. All work done in the reactor compartment

, must be done remotely, working through the water shield..

The refueling of the reactor will be accanplished by e fuel handling

~ methods of hea.t remove.l from the core d.uring shutd.own. To remove the reactor hea.t

_ during an unlosding opera.tion, a8 sepa.rate circuit is usua.lly provided. In this

system primary water is pumped. through a.n extema.l heat exchanger thus removing

| hea.t frm the core of the reactor. In eddition, when fuel elements are removed,

- uneven coolant flow may result in the creation of hot spots in some | sreas of the

: core. Further study is necessary to d.etemine the feasibility of ;plugging these
| lea.kage paths d.uring rei’ueling(h). This problem of cooling the core would be of

lu Boiling Water Reactors

j | A boiling water reactor presents problems from & maintenance point
of view due to steam activation and the presence of e.ctivated impurites in the
coolant. The reactor vessel and supporting core structure will contain various

emounts of induced. ectivity ase result of direct neutron irradiation. Hence 5

‘the radiation levels cannot be lowered by decontamination processes. Structurel

failures inside the reactor vessel could possibly be repaired by removal of fuel
elements and i‘looding the vessel. Tools equipped 'with extension handles would

ensble the repairs to be mede. If the resctor shouldﬁ fall, it would probably :

-have to be removed and replaced with & new one. The problem of removing the vessel

and subsequently storing or safely disposing oi' it has never been satisfactorily
golved in any known reactor design. Apparently it is planned to solve this problem _

. This is due to the q;uick decay of the a.ctivated stenm. sy activated impurities

by chemical washing would be required. This is true of the steam separation drums

which should impose about the seme general mecha.nical problems as are encountered

Since the steem to the turbine is radioactive and more corrosive

 

than ordinery due to the carryover of oxygen released by dieassocietion of the
wvater, . the turbine must be designed to be especielly lesk tight as well as unusually
corrosion resis_tant. - Pue to the severe oxygen generation by rediation in the

EBWR, eboutj 25 prm in the wuter, -the cerbon steel steam pipes and turbines have

‘been nickel plated since start-up. The radiastion levels near the turbine complicates

theus of p&ventive meintenence procedures s & fact which further decreases the

high integrity and complice.tion of design add considembly to the cost of plent
construction and maintene.nce. |

Hhen the turbine or condenser require maintenance they are decon-
tamineted by filling with hot we.ter, vhich 1s circukted at & slow rate for a

5. Sodium Graphite Reactors

_ Sodium graphite res.ctors are not strietly speaking. comps.ro.ble to. the
solid fuel: rea.ctors ths.t have been described previously. ‘.The difference is that

. .when Sodium is used &8 & coolent ..in e heterogeneous reactor, it hecomes highly;

rsdioectitr'e ’due to the fom‘ation of Heeh as 8 result of neutron capture. This

radioactive isotope hes 8 15 hour helf: life snd emits in s.ddition to 'bete
particles, two gamna photons of fs.irly high energy, namely, 1.38 and 2.75 mev.

As & result 'y maintensnce problems s.re increased s.nd shielding ie necessary for piping

pumps s &nd hest exchengers. This condition is somewhet similar to s eirculeting
fuel homogeneous reactor with the exception ths.t the ra.dioactive sodium produces
no induced ectivity in the piping, vs.lves y OY conta.inment vessels.

i!he volume to 'be shielded ma.y be decreesed by the use of a

secondsry cools.nt ’ which leeves only the primsry circulating loop requiring

: extensive shielding. Thie is. noted becense meintensnce of shielded equipment ig

_This is contingent of course on the nonlea.kage of the nainstop vs.lves on each

loop and the e.'bility to drs.in the sodium from the 100p requiring maintenance.

some aetivity remains after fluehing , 1t probably will be necegsary to wait until
the m-"a.ell decays to tolerance levels.

" A feature of 1liquid metal coolant reactors is that pump maintenance
should be simplified. The electro-magnetic pump, having no moving parts, should
zjequire less maintepance than conventional pumps and this is importent because
the pumps may be contaminated with redicective materisls. Since oxygen free liquid
sodium doee not attack steinless steels &t temperatures below 1110 degree F,
failures of loop components due to metal aﬁtack gshould be reduced. However, the
temperature of the fuel elements of the Sodium Reeeter Experiment run as high

as laoo/degrees F, and it is Loped that the mass transfer occurring in steel a.t

;th_is tempera.ture can be controlled by cerbain additives. ‘I'he sodium tempera.ture

oA

leaving the core however, is only 960 degree F.

Fuel handling and charging nresent 'prorblemsv similer to those faced
by other reactor designs using solid fuel elements. The basic need is to find
materials, cledding especially, that are suita.'ble for use in molten sodium.

__ Estimates of general operation and maintensnce costs for a 160 mw,
electricaf’, sodium graphite resctor planf range in the area of 1 mil/kwh, which is
in line with other solld fuel‘reaetor designs,

One factor which might cause an upwvard trend in thie figure is the

problem of heating the syetem; Sodium hee & melting point of 208 degrees F and

therefore it is neeeSSary to first raise the te‘mperature of 'the syetem from ambient

to at least 208 degrees F in ord.er to allow filling end circulating of the sodium.

This can be d.one with mmers:lon heaters (only 1f the system is full), claxn shell

pipe hea.ters ’ resista.nce heater wr&pping or 60 eycle induetion heating. The latter

e being advocs.ted for the EBB-II because cf 1ts promise of greater relia.bility.

- Induction hea.ting of a. non-ferritic stainless steel system requires

‘bhe :Lnsta.llation of & carbon steel shell around a.ll the piping and components.

In summary, & sodium graphite reactor should be as eesy to maintain

clearly points up the need \for relieble mechanisms inside the vessel.

fuel type of reactors described previouslyo
1. Aqueous Homogeneous Fuel Reactor

In & resctor of this type, ajueoue fuel solutions of uranium-selts
are circulated 'bhrough ‘a core vesgel where criticality occurs end thence through en
external heat exchanger and back through & cenned :eo;hor pump to the core. The fuel
golution leaving the core is no longer criticel lbut does continue to emit
deleyed neutrons, which cause radicactivity to be induced in all parte of the
circuleting system. HMost of the metal present in the componente and connecting
pipe is 'stei'ﬁless.steel. Ari:er one dey'e decay time, the activity remeining in stain-
less steel is largely due to cobalt ﬁhieh hag 'a.‘ 5,3 year half-life ; hence the speeia.l
care reguired for meititenance operations. |

If the circuleting fuel is kept below the critical velocity, an
oxide £ilm will form on the internal surfaces of the system and elthough this is
beneficial ;frmn the standpoint of reduced eerrdsiqn attack, it also ig & source of
depogited a.c't:ivity vhen the system is dra.inecl for maintensnce., Tt ig hoped" tﬁet
d_e'co:;teminatien by acld rinses will remove moet of ‘this deposited _aetiv:l.ty, ~hov}rever,
the presence of the induced sctivity in the mefa.l precludes any direct maintenance.

The. question may erise as.to‘ the feasibility of operating and main-
-haining 8 -hcﬁogeneeus reactor plant. Westinéhouse Electric Corporation in conjunction
with Tﬁe Pemisylva.nia Pow‘er e.nd Light Ccmpa.ny had. eﬁuﬂies "mde of this phase of the
proposed Pennsylva.nia Adva.nced Reactor (PAR) Pro,ject (1 ,12) Thege analyses ind.i-

cated that ma.intenance is feasible.

Hdwever, the maintenance philestaphs‘ of this large sca.le , 150 mw
electric, reactor plent differs wid.ely frcm tha.t employed on the experimental
reactors constructed to de.te. It we.s decid.ed. ea.rly in the design ste,ge of the PAR
not to rely c cn remote ‘wet maintenance for the follwing reesons: :(13)

1. Eydrostatie pressures imrelved 1n flooding the plant

3. Poseibility that shielding water can enter and conteminate

- the system.

k. Deley ‘time necessary to allow large pieces of equipment to .
cool down before being submerged in éhielding vater to avoid thermal shock.

" As & basic temant of the maintenance philosophy, it was decided
thet only large components such es steam generators would be repaired in place,
that 1is, within the vepor shiélq.. The preferred maintenence procedure for all
other items is to disconnect the faulty coﬁponents es quickly as possible and
replace with & spare unit and t.hen decontaminate and repair the faulty unit and use
it es & spare This philosophy has limitations since e large ce.pital investment

is required for stocking stand.by equiment. For this reegon, &ll four fuel circus

| la.ting loops of the PAR will be of the seme "ha.nd thus pemitting & smaller

stock of replacement parhs. |
Another decision mede eerly in the PAR design progrem was to

 eliminate 8ll flanges end velves in the main 20 inch diemeter fuel circulsting

loops; The‘refore‘, efter the plent goes critical, eny maintenance req_uiring'

cutting the main ,lo‘op ie dependent uppn the develomment of successful remote

positioner, cutter-grinder, welder, and inspection devices. Sizice one might say

‘the future successful operation and maintenance of the plant depend.s upon these d.evices,

.;"'Westinghcmse :l.s comitted to & sizable develolzuent program in thie respect. BStudies

heve ind.icated that remote welding end insPection are feasi‘ale(lh-)

Problems s‘cill to be solved. in the homogeneous reactor design that

| te gome exbent are -common to all reaetors a.re

1. Insulation - When mwtion is placed on canpcnents and

'piping it no'c om.y presents a problem a.s fa.r as remaval with remote tools 1is
) concerned, but it. also hid.es the locatien and size of & defect. Easily detachable

pre=fomed. insula.tion may be the answer to this problem.
2. Stea:n Generator Ma.intenance Equipment - Detection of & 1eak1ng

regolved. After the leaking tube is found, plugging by remote means presents
further difficulties. Vertical steam generstors may help slleviate this problem.
3. Repair of components - Faulty pieces of equipment, such &s

eirculeting pumps, when removed from the reactor will be radioactive end hence if

.they ere to be salvaged, must be repaired using remote tools end menipulators.

These toole should be rugged end relieble in operetion in order to complete the
repair job once it has sterted. Techniquee will have to be developed for the
epplicetion of these remote tools to every item in the plent as most will have to
be either replaced or repairgq. during the lifetime of the plant. Swsll items of
equipment Amigﬁt be scrapped rather than repaired economically.

Estimates on the maintenance costs of homogeneous reactor plants
vary fram 0.70 mills/lwh to e figure of from 2 to 5 times the operating end
maintensnce costs of a cdnparable fossil fired stesm plent. The estimate of 0.70
mills/kwh was besed on 1 per cent per year of the capital investment of the turbine-
generstor plant plus 3 per cent per year of the ca.pitél investment of the reactor
plant. It vas estimated that maintenance of the reactor plant would be of the
same order costwise as that of an industrial chemical processing plant(ls). The
estimate of 2 to 5 times the cost of & fossil fueled plent was based on the
observation that maintenance perfomed with remote tools a.nd panipulators plus the
possible limited working time of personnel due to radiation levels would involve
longer periods of down time. | |

- As & group ’ circulating fuel rea.c'bors are the most difficult to
maintain. A survey of pro;pesed homogeneous circula.ting fuel resctors reveals that
the present philosophy is directed toward remote dry maintenzmce. This method of
maintenance depends e.lmost entirely on the use of remotely operated toole and
equipment which at the present are ,just entering the d.evelopment stage. It seens
quite pro'ba'ble that & year will be required before an evaluation can be made of
thisg development program.

for the attainment of high temperatures without the necessity for excessive pressures,
A ree.ctor of this design reta.ins most of the good features of & circulating fuel
reactor with the a.d.ded fea.ture of low pressure components. One of the dised-
venteges a.cqmired however, is the neceSsity i’or heeting the circulating loop, dump
tanks, and other components in which the fused salt might be present. The

problem is more difficult than that faced for exemple in sodium cooled reactors

becausge the selts usually have & higher melting point. ‘I'he capacity of the pre-

_- hee.ting equipment should be lerge enough to raise the loop temperature to at

least 1000 degrees F.
K feasibility study on & fused salt reactor plent has been made by

the Ok Ridge School of Reactor: Technology(ls) A duplex-oompertanented ghielding

~ design was e.dopted to fit thei_r philosophy the.t no maintenance vill be performed

inside the conteinment_ vessel while the reactor is eriticel.

| The erra.ngement of the plent pls,ccs the resactor, primary hee.t ex-
changers, a.nd fuel dump tanks within the primary shield. Located in six shield.ed.
comparinnents ;a.ro_und the primary systen are | the pmimary loop sodium circulating pumps,
expension tanks, drain end charge tanks, and intermediate heat exchangers.

Outside the shielding but isoleted to prevent spreading of fires. in case of

sodium leaks a.re the steem genere.tors e.nd. intemédiete sodium pumps. |

The primary shield is desigied to proteet personnel i‘rom decay

b ge.mmas only, :since maintena.nce will not be performed. while the reactor is in
‘ operstion. Provisions are ma.de for dra.ining and flushing the sodium from individual |
'intemedia.te hea.t exchanger circuits so that no radio‘ective sod:l.um 1is within the
‘ compartment where meintenanoe 1is to be perfomed. The sides of the ra.die.l com~

po.rtments serve &s shields o.nd. provid.e protection i’rom dccs.y gemns.s from the

redioactive sodium in ad,jacent compartments. As & result, it is not necessary :

| to drain all the prima.ry loops when only one circuit req_uires maintenence.

The equipment outs_ide the contaimment vessel is non-radioe,ctive

and may be maimta.ine'a in the conventional ,me.nmer. : Haintenance of the equipment

inside the cohte.iment vessel and shielded areas will require remote tools and
techniques. The major items vhich will require this special equiment ere the
fuel circulating pumps, primery heat exchanger tube 'bundles s intermediate heat
excha.nger tube bundles, end primery circuit sodium circula.ting PUMpE . -

Access to the fuel circuleting pumps and primery heat exchanger tube
bundles 15‘ through an openins in the top shield plug.-. Feulty pumpe csn be removed
and replaced by spare units whieh will be kept on ha.nd. .

The maintenance of the primry heat excﬁ@ger tube bHundles poses
nore difficult problems. A leek in a tube bundle would introduce sodium into the
fused fluoride selt fuel solution and dilute it, which might be onemethod of
identifying & lesk. However, the methods of determining which bundle is leaking end
consequently remotely cutting the feed lines to that bundle end blenking them off by
wvelding heve not yet been developed.

It is hoped that meintenance on the intermediate sodium systems cean
be perfome_;l directly in the shieldgd compart:me_nts sfter dralining and flushing
the radiosctive sodium from the loop. | |

¥While this is only one of severa.l_ proposed designs for fused salt
homogeneous rgacbr systems, it illusltrates most of the maintensnce problems faced;
na mely, 1ndu¢¢d activity in a.]_l_l components touched ﬁy the circulating fuel,
decreased acceissiﬁ_ility to prima.ry and intermediate 'loopé' as & result of
shielding, a.nd. f:lnaliy difficulty of eccess to faulty componex;jf_ ahbuld 8 method.

for 2 plant of this type will ;probably run higher then for an a.queous homogeneaus
reactor plant i’or the a.bove reasons. |

3. Liquid Metal Fueled Reactor

Qne of the many reactor concepts which appear ‘prgmising for electric
power production is the liquid metal fuel reactor und.er development at Brookha.ven
ﬁationa.l I.abcra.tory. A stud.y(l7 )'by the Babcock and Wilcox Company indicates the

feasibility of & reactor of this design. Included in the study program was the

engineering design of & reactor which generates 550 mw of heat.

- _Mo.intenonce of e liquid metel fuel reactor will not be easy. Most
of the problems faced in' en aqueous homogenous system are present in this reactor
type; namely, Induced activity in all oomponents' due to deleyed neutron emission

primary system end Polonimn210 ; and the reﬁuireme’ot of & leak tight system to oonte,_ih
the ectiveteo. i’uel end Po210, In -a.d.dition, heating facilities are required for the
piping and componente, thus edding to tlie maintenance problem. ‘

The oomplexity of the hea.ting problen may be illustrated in the
following mazmer. Should the heaters feil after the reactor hes been crit.ica.l for
some time, the d.ecay heet_ of the fuel plus the expangion vol\nneo in the blanket
and fuel systems ehould prevent .e‘olidifioe.tion of the fuel and blanket liquids
with their accompanying volumetric expeneione. However, 1f the heeteis failed
during sta.rtup ) no decey hee.t would be present to prevent solid.ifioa.tion end o
serious fa.ilure could occur. The resulte of thie possi‘olity are duplice.te hegter
eircuits and sta.ndby emergency dieoel-generetor sets. |

The use of ehield.ed. eanpar‘%ente for the eireule.ting locps in the
iotermeo.iete system will pemit_the ieole.tion of & single feulty intermediate
-heo.t ex'cbanger;or primary coolent"plmp‘ However, even after & period of cooling
off and deconteminetion the equipment will etill be quite ective as & result of
‘indueed aotivity end the preeenoe of- fiesion and corrosion produets which reme.in
e.fter deeontemioatioe. Removel of the equipment will of neoessity be & remote
operation am will be tiiffieult et best.

» o As is the eese with aqueous homogeneous reaetore , the success of
the meintenence effort will depend. to e lerge degree upon the development of remote
outting, weld.ing, end inspeotion d.eviees. - |
