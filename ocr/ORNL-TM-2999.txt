QUALITY-ASSURANCE PRACTICES IN CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE
OF THE MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR EXFERIMENT

B. H. Webster

Abstract

At

T The MSRE was built at Oak Ridge National ILaboratory to demonstrate

the practicality of the molten-salt reactor concept. Site construction

and installation of auxiliary systems were by outside contractors, while

the primary reactor systems were installed by ORNL forces. Design, pro-

curement, construction, and maintenance followed ASME codes, ORNL

practices, and special procedures developed for the MSRE by the ORNL

Reactor Division group primarily responsible for quality assurance, This

report describes the program, the problems that were encountered, and the

lessons that were learned. Four years of reliable operation of the MSRE -~
proved the success of the quality-assurance program.

Keywords: reactors, fused salts, MSRE, inspection, construction,
maintenance, quality assurance, construction contractors, inspection
procedures, material control, cleanliness control, welder qualifications,
inspection of welds, leak testing.

OF THE MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR EXTERIMENT

B. H. Webster
INTRODUCTION

The Molten=-Salt Reactor Experiment has been proved by four years of
operation to be a well-built, reliable reactor. This report describes the
quality-assurance program followed in the construction and maintenance of
the system. The intent is to describe the details involved in putting
together a sound, workable, relatively trouble-free system.

The report is divided into sections covering site preparation, in-
stallation of auxiliary systems and equipment, construction of the salt

systems, and maintenance along with conclusions and recommendations.
STTE CONSTRUCTION

Choosing the Location

The site chosen for the MSKE was an existing facility in which one
reactor had operated and in which preparations had been made for instal-
lation of another reactor. The facility was built for the Aircraft Reac-
tor Experiment (ARE), which was operated in 195Lk. It was later modified
for the Aircraft Reactor Test (ART), and at the time the Aircraft Nuclear
Propulsion Program was terminated, a considerable amount of electrical
equipment had been installed, the reactor cell had been built, and most of
the auxiliary equipment had been purchased.

The basis for the decision to use this facility for the MSRE was
economic, Unfortunately several years had passed since the ARE and ART
programs had been terminated, and conseguently the records, drawings,
specifications, inspection reports, etc., on the building, equipment, and
services were scattered and some were lost. In order to make use of these
facilities for the MSRE, it was necessary for the project designers and

draftsmen to determine the condition of the equipment and the services, as
well as the various cells and buildings, in order to either design the
new system to fit in with the old or modify the o0ld in order to make it
fit in with the new system.

Needless to say, the assurance of guality in the adaptation of old
facilities to new systems is often a difficult task. Such was the case

for the MSRE.
Site Preparation

In May 1961, a small (~ $20,000) site preparation contract was awarded
to the H. K. Ferguson Company, who was at that time ORNL's prime CPFF con-
tractor. This contract included excavation for the fuel drain tank cell,
modification of the structure around the radiator cell, installation of a
new entrance into the east side of the reactor building, and removal of
unneeded piping conduit and equipment. The drawings and specifications
for this job were prepared by the ORNL Plant and Equipment Division (BE)
design group and approved by ORNL Reactor Division management. The P&E
Division supplied a construction inspector to ascertain that all specifi-
cations were met., The inspector kept a daily log, which is on record in
ORNL Laboratory Records Department. Since no high-quality welding,
pressure-vessel inspection, or other code work was involved, no other

records were keprt on this phase of construction.
Major Building Modifications

The prime contract for the major building modifications was awarded
to Kaminer Construction Company of Chamblee, Georgia. This phase of the
modification was started in September 1961. The design and specifications
were Pprepared by the P&E design group in cooperation with the Reactor Di-
vision (RD) design section and with special assistance on welding specifi-

cation and procedures from Metals and Ceramics Division (M&C) personnel.
Interpretation of Specifications

A short time after work had begun on the major building modifications,
a question arose concerning the intent of the specifications covering the

structural integrity of the reactor and fuel drain tank cells (classified
as secondary containment). The specifications had been written to cover
cases under the ASME Unfired Pressure Vessel Code, Section 8. At this
time certain changes were being made in this section to cover Nuclear
Vessel Code cases. After considerable discussion and negotiation between
representatives from RD, M&C, and Kaminer Construction Company, the fol-
lowing amendments were made in the specifications: Interpretation of ASME
Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section 8, Special Cases 1177, 1270N,
1272N, and 12TLN.

Assuring the Use of Specified Materials

Stating the type materisl to be used in any given situation is ob-
viously only a beginning. In order to assure that materials meet the
specifications, testing and inspection must begin at the vendor's or in
some cases at the steel mills and fabrication plants. Once an acceptable
melt was established, heat numbers were assigned to all materials made
from this particular melt. This identification, showing the heat number
and inspection request number, was stamped on the material so that it was
identifiable even after installation. Records were kept on all materials
to cover identification, location in system, cleanliness, and weld-
inspection report that included welder's name, filler metal used, etc. (see
UCN Form 1149 in App. A). All records on materials, etc., noted above are
stored in the ORNL Laboratory Records Department.

Establishing Welding Procedures and Training and Qualification of Welders

Having established the procedure by which welding should be done, the
next task was toc "qualify" the procedure. This was done by the FE and
M&C weld-qualification groups (if a procedure to cover the specification
was not available). Welders were then trained and qualified to use the
procedure (see WPS-1402 and UCN-3312 for typical Weld Qualification Pro-
cedure, App. B)

Inspection of Welds, Material, and Equipment

Qualifying Inspectors. All inspection required to cover the work
performed by outside contractors (Kaminer Construction Company, Chicago

Bridge and Iron, etc.), as well as by manufacturers and vendors, was
performed by personnel from the ORNL Inspection Engineering (IE) group.
These people were usually chosen for a particular phase of work because
of their background in that field. 11 inspectors were required to go
through a training period in order to qualify for the tasks they were to
pverform. In general the curriculum for this training was taken fiom the
SNT (Society for Non-Destructive Testing) manual and was designed to cover
Section 8 of the ASME Code and the special cases noted previously. This
has since been revised to cover Section 3, Nuclear Vessel Code., With in-
creasing emphasis being placed on quality control, it is suggested that
CRNL should study the methods used for training inspectors, who should
be gualified and certified.

Inspection and Records of Work Performed by Kaminer Construction and
Subcontractors. Drawings and specifications were issued to the IE in-
spectors. FEach inspector worked closely with the FE construetion in-
spector and with supervisors and craftsmen of the contractor so that he
was constantly aware of all work planned or in progress on which his ser-
vices were required. The inspector had the responsibility to see that all
work within his jurisdiction was performed according to the specifications,
and he had authority through the constructicn inspector to reject any work
that did not meet these specifications. He also was responsible for main-
taining records on welds, stress relieving, heat treatment, leak-testing,

etc A1l such records are now in ORNL Laboratory Records Department,
Cutside Modificaticns

The contract for outside modifications and construction was awarded
to Hixon Construction Company of Knoxville, Tennessee. The outside work
consisted of construction of an offgas filter house and offgas stack,
installation of stack fans, and installation of the cooling tower, pumps,
and piping. The criteria for this phase of construction were established
by design groups from the Reactor and General Engineering Divisions. The
design was done by P&E. Inspection was performed by the GE construction
inspector, by representatives from Inspection Engineering, and by Reactor

Division ccordinators. A daily progress report and a log were kept by the

construction inspector, All records are now in the ORNL Laboratory Records

Department,

&
summary of Site Modification and Construction

In general the site preparation work went smoothly  One major problem
was a misinterpretation of the specifications. It appears that in the
future more thought should be given to specification writing, and a meeting
of the minds as to the interpretations of the specifications should be
reached insofar as possible before the work is started. In particular, the
inspection procedures for components purchased from outside vendors should
be clarified; since many of these components are only spot-checked, the
risk of inferior materials and workmanship is much greater. Also the over-
all quality control standards should be more detailed and -should be under-
stood and accepted by all groups involved.

As stated in the preceding descriptions, all inspection and quality
control work was done in accordance with the specifications and procedures
prepared by Reactor Division and P&E Division design groups. These draw-
ings, specifications, procedures, and records are located in the ORNL

Laboratory Records Department.

INSTALLATION OF EQUIEMENT AND SYSTEMS

The H. K. Ferguson Company was awarded a CPFF contract to install the
service and auxiliary systems and equipment., These included instrument
air compressors and piping; control room piping and equipment; leak de-
tectors; water, steam, and offgas piping and equipment; and all electrical
systems and equipment, including heater wiring up to the junction boxes
at the cell walls. The above work was started shortly after building

modifications were completed.
Material Control

A1l materials and equipment for the CPFF contract work were procured
by ORNL purchasing departments. All materials and equipment were more or
less standard items and were relatively easy to obtain, except for the

high-quality stainless steel piping used in some of the systems.
Procurement, Inspection, and ITdentification of Critical Materials

The critical material, whether fabricated into tanks, heat exchangers,
etc., by outside vendors or delivered to the laboratory as raw material,
was required to meet Metals and Ceramics Division Specifications (index
in App. C). The specifications were written through a joint effort of the
General Engineering, Metals and Ceramics, and Reactor Divisions. Inspec-
tion procedures were established by M&C, Reactor, and IE personnel, All
critical materials (Met Spec Material) were spot-checked at the vendor's
plant., Heat numbers of materials were etched or stamped at 12-in., inter-
vals on all materials, along with the inspection request number (IR No.).
The identification was maintained up to and through the installation period
and was noted on all weld inspecticn reports. Inspection, certifications,
and identification of all critical weld rod were accomplished by the same

procedure as that noted for pipe, fittings, etc.
Inspection of Critical Materials After Delivery to ORNL

Critical materials were delivered 1in care of the Inspection Engineering
Department. Upon receipt of this material, each item was inspected by one
or more of the following methods: dye-penetrant testing, ultrasonic exami-

nation, and radioagraph examination.
Material Cleaning Procedures

After certificaticn, all pipe, tubing, and fittings were delivered to
the 7000-area cleaning station, and cleaning was accomplished by the pro-
cedure of Appvendix D (Cleaning and Storing of Pipe and Fittings to be Used
in MSRE Construction). Records of cleaning results were maintained on
the form included in this appendix, The records are now on file in the

MSEE Maintenance Engineer's office.
Control of Material at 7503 Stores

With all the inspection, certification, and identifying of materials
that had gone before, there remained one very critical control point: how
to handle the receiving and issuing records at the construction site stores.
These problems were handled by the procedure in Appendix E (Control of Ma-
terials After Delivery to Building 7503).
Welder Qualification

All weld procedures to be used by H. K. Ferguson were already quali-
fied and are a matter of record. It remained only to qualify the welders
for the several procedures. This qualification was performed at the Y-12
test shop under the surveillance and instruction cof Y-12 Inspection Engi-

neering personnel.

Duties of X~10 Inspection Engineering at the Construction Site
Covering Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Contract Work

One or more inspectors from Inspection Engineering was assigned to
the construction site to handle inspection that came under their Jjuris-
diction. These duties included;:
1, inspection of all code welding (dye-penetrant, radio-graph, ete.),
2 witnessing all pressure and leak-testing of all code pipe and vessels,,
3. inspection of all materials before and during installation, and
L

record keeping on all the above activities.
Reactor Division Quality Control Activities

In addition to coordinating the efforts of the CPFF contractor with
design, Pprocurement, inspection, etc., the Reactor Division quality con-
trol group assumed the responsibility for and carried out the following:

1. Wrote cleaning and test procedures for systems not covered by
the Code, such as compressed air systems, water systems, etc. Formulated
check-off lists for equipment and systems to cover preoperational testing.

2. Worked with CPFF crafts and supervisors in carrying out the
cleaning, testing, and checkout of piping, wiring, and equipment.

3. Formulated, with help of P&E engineers, leak-test procedures
for testing vapor-suppression system. Worked with CPFF contractor per-
forming and documenting test.

L, Routinely checked piping and components during and after instal-
lation for cleanliness; notified craft supervision when additional cleaning
was required. Made daily checks on installed piping to assure ends were

closed; notified supervision of violations.
The problem of keeping the installed piping and components clean
and preventing foreign material getting into open-end piping and equipment
proved to be a major one. This area of quality control should be stressed

in future (and present) quality control procedures:!

Summary of Quality Control Procedures Used in
Connection with CPEFF Work

All critical piping, heat exchangers, tanks, etc., were fabricated
from materials certified to meet ASME codes and specifications formulated
from these codes. Critical piping and components were inspected and
tested according to ASME Codes provisions or approved procedures derived
from them. All work (critical and other) was inspected by Inspection
Engineering personnel and Reactor Division quality control personnel.
Check=-off lists were used to assure that wiring, piping, and equipment
were installed in accordance with drawings and procedures. All systems
were tested by acceptable procedures, and the test results were documented.
Records of weld inspection, material certification, leak and pressure tests,
preoperational tests, cleanliness, etc., are on file either in the ORNL

Laboratory Records Department or in the MSRE Maintenance Engineer's office.
ASSEMBLY AND INSTALLATION OF MSRE FUEL AND COOLANT SYSTEMS

All designs and specifications for the primary systems were either
formulated by the Reactor Division design group or were prepared under
their direct surveillance, Many of the designs, specifications, and pro-
cedures were derived from information furnished by the Reactor Division
development group.

Most of the major components were fabricated and tested in Y-12 shoPs.
All work on the primary and auxiliary systems inside the reactor cell,
coolant cell, and fuel drain cells was performed by ORNL craftsmen from

the P&E and I&C Divisions.
Materials Control

Procedures the same as those described in the foregoing section were
used to control the receipt, identification, storage, and issue of materials
used in the primary and auxiliary systems inside the coolant, reactor, and
fuel drain cells, This system apparently worked well, since there was no
known instance in which the wrong material was used in either the primary

or auxiliary systems.

Welding

The material used in the primary systems was INOR-8 (now known as
Hastelloy-N or Incoloy 806). Because there had not been much experience
with this material, it was necessary that welding procedures be specified
and tested. Welding Procedure Specification WES-1402 (App. B) was tested
and approved for welding INOR-8 materials. (See also form UCN-3312 in
App. B, which was used for recording the development information.) In
addition, several other '"mew'" procedures were necessary, such as those for
welding INOR-8 to Inconel, INOR-8 to stainless steel, etc. These pro-
cedures were developed by the EE weld inspection group and by M&C person-

nel and were carried out under their striect surveillance.
Welder Qualification

Welders were qualified to meet the above specifications per ORNL
Operators Qualification Test Specification QTS-33 for inert-gas-shielded
tungsten-arc welding of INOR-8 alloy pipe, plate, and fittings to Inconel
material. (See QIS-33, App. F, which is typical of all procedures.)

Weld Inspection

P&E inspectors were used exclusively on welding performed by ORNL
craftsmen. All inspectors were required to be qualified; that is, they
were required to actually perform the type of welding they were to in-
spect. This had distinct advantages, because when an inspector who is not
a qualified welder looks at a completed weld, he can usually only say
"The weld is good" or "The weld is bad," Rarely will he be qualified to

instruet the welder in what he should do to make corrections if the weld
10

does not meet the specifications. On the other hand, an inspector who is

a qualified welder can usually spot the improper technique while the welding
is in progress. Corrections can then be made with a minimum of delay. It
seems clear that much time and effort could be (and was) saved by these
highly competent inspectors.

Inspection techniques were formulated with the several ASME and ASTM
codes as guide lines. ORNL Inspection Emgineerihg and Metals and Ceramics
personnel then categorized these several procedures into six classes (A
through F) with respect to the quality requirements of the welds. For
example, Schedule B inspections required inspection of fit-up, inspection
of the root pass before final closure, dye-pPenetrant inspection on each
pass, and a radiograph of the completed weld; whereas Schedule F required
only visual inspection. The designer specified on each drawing the in-
spection schedule, and a copy of each drawing was issued to the welding

inspectors (see table of inspection schedules in App. G).
Stress Relijeving of Welds

All TNOR-8 welds and adjacent piping were stress relieved by a pro-
cedure based on ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section III N-532.
The welding inspector was responsible for inspecting the preparation for
the stress-relieving operation and recording the information. The records
of all stress-relieving cperations are on file in the MSRE Maintenance

Engineer's office.
Inspection for Cleanliness

In addition to the cleanliness control described in Appendix D,
INOR-8 required cther more stringent controls. INOR-8 (Hastelloy-N)
is a high-nickel alloy which will alloy at the MSRE operating temperature
of approximately 1200°F with any metal or alloy having a low melting point;
fcr example, sluminum, zine, lead, etc, In addition, sulphur-bearing
compounds are incompatible with INCR-8 at elevated temperatures., Many of
the lubricants normally used in machining metals were known to have high
sulphur content. Therefore because of the contamination potential associ-

ated with machining, fabricating, and assembling the piping and components,
11

rigid safegﬁards were established, Several different types and brands of
lubricants, marking materials, permanent and temporary insulation, etc.,
were analyzed for the metals and compounds listed above. (See App. H for
results of these analyses.) The reactor site storekeeper was instructed
to refrain from storing materials that were noct compatible with INOR-8 or
stainless steel. Lists of materials compatible with INOR-8 and with stain-
less steel were prepared from the analyses and issued to the craft super-
visors. A constant vigil was maintained by the weld inspectors and by
Reactor Division quality control personnel. All INOR-8 vessels and piping
were carefully surveyed for evidence of contamination. All surfaces were
carefully cleaned immediately prior to installation of heaters and insu-
lation, regardless of lack of evidence of contamination, This strict and
seemingly expensive operation apparently was worthwhile, since there is

no evidence of damage to the materials in the system after years at ele-

vated temperatures.
Leaktesting of Components, Subassemblies, and Svstems

Components such as the reactor vessel, heat exchangers, pumps, and
fuel drain tanks were leaktested at the Y-12 fabrication site. Much of
the piping for the primary and auxiliary systems was prefabricated and in
many cases leaktested before installation. Leaktest specifications (i.e.,
type of test to be performed) were noted on the drawings. Detailed pro-
cedures and record forms were written by the Reactor Division quality con-
traol group located at the MSRE construction site. Flow diagrams were
"color-coded" to indicate the leaktest status and type of test performed.
These flowsheets are a part of the permanent record, along with the test
results noted on the leaktest forms. All leaktests were witnessed by
Reactor Division quality control personnel.

All primary-system piping was leaktested by using the mass-spectrometer
method (helium leaktest). Wherever possible the piping was evacuated, en-
cased in plastic, and flooded with helium. The leaktest was then performed
and recorded per procedure MSRE-SK-216 and form UCN-5113 (see App. I) with
a consolidated leak-detector machine. In some cases it was necessary to

pressurize the piping and move the leak-detector probe over the welds and
12

surface of the pipe, after which the assembly was enclosed in plastic and
the probe inserted into the bag at the highest point. If no leak was
indicated, after walting for some predetermined length of time, an amount
of helium equal to the allowable leak was injected into the bag at the
lowest point to check the sensitivity of the leak-detector machine., The
results of these tests are recorded and are a part of the permanent record.

Hydrostatic and other pressure and leak tests were performed as in-
dicated on the design drawings. The form (App. I) was used to record the
results of all such tests.

Valid leak tests were performed on all piping systems. Leak testing
was performed by craftsmen and witnessed by Reactor Division quality con-
trol personnel. Helium leaktesting was guite time-consuming because of
the shortage of trained craftsmen. It would appear to be desirable to

consider instituting a training program in this field as soon as practical.
Agsembly and Installation of Components and Piping

One of the major objectives of the MSRE was to prove that it could
be maintained. To make this possible it was necessary to assemble the

equipment so that exact duplicates could be fabricated if the need arose,
Reactor Cell Component Assembly

A fixture was designed to support the components in the same position
relative to each other as they would be after they were installed in the
reactor cell., The elevations and center lines of the components and the
slopes and angles of the piping and flanges were established by a group
of civil engineers with precision optical tooling. Some of the people
involved in formulating the assembly procedures attended a school con-
ducted by the Brunson Cptical Instrument Co. for training in the use of
Precision optical instruments.

When installed in the cell, the components fitted together with re-
markable accuracy. A photograph of ccmponents while on the fixture and
after installation in the cell is shown in Appendix J.

All dimensions were recorded on as-built drawings and are on file in
the MSRE Maintenance Engineer's office. One major side benefit from this

method of assembly was the easy access for welding and other associated work.
13

In addition, with the major components being assembled outside the
cell, the in-cell installation of auxiliary piping, electrical, and thermo-
couple leads, etec., was simplified. A check list indicating the care that
was taken to assure that all was in order before the assembly was installed
ig reproduced in Appendix K., This type of final check is an important

part of any quality-assurance progranm,
Fuel Drain Cell Components Assembly and Installation

The general procedures noted above were also used to assemble the
two fuel drain tanks, steam domes, and the fuel flush tank. The center
lines, elevations, etc., were established on the tanks, steam domes, etc.,
and the fixture was then made to fit the critical points noted on the in-
stallation drawings. The photograph in Appendix L shows the drain tank
assembly located on the fixture.

All dimensions were recorded on as-built drawings. The assembly was
lowered into the cell and a cutting platform was fitted to the salt inlet
and outlet lines (no flanges in these lines). The location of the cutting
platform relative to the tank was noted on the as-built drawings. In case
it should become necessary, the steam dome or the drain tank, or the two
items together, may be removed and an exact duplicate fabricated and in-

stalled by remote and semiremote methods.

Installation and Checkout of Flectrical Wiring,
Heaters, and Equipment

As in the case of the auxiliary piping, the installation of the elec-
trical systems was a Jjoint effort between the CPFF contractor and the IE
crafts. Installation of motors, switchgear, wiring, and thermocouple leads
outside the fuel cells and up to the final junction at the cell walls was
performed by the contractor. The heaters, electrical leads, and thermo-
couple leads inside the cells were installed by P&E craftsmen. The equip-
ment outside the cell was checked out, and the motors were '"bumped™ for
proper rotation by the contractor. Heater leads and thermocouple leads
were "run out," tested for grounding, and identified at the cell walls by

the contractor. The heaters, heater leads, and thermocouple leads inside
14

the cells were installed and checked out by P&E craftsmen, after which
tie-ins were made at the cell walls and the total system was checked out
from the control panels.

Records were kept on the above tests and are now located in the equip-
ment files in the MSRE Maintenance Engineer's office., This part of the
work was well coordinated and very little trouble or confusion was en-

countered.
Remote Maintenance Practice During the Construction Period

The remote maintenance development group was in constant communication
with the system design and construction groups. During the design and con-
struction period, procedures were written, and tools and equipment were
designed, fabricated, and tested. In order to check out some of the tools
and procedures, maintenance equipment was set up, and several pieces of
equipment were removed and reinstalled. These practice runs were helpful
in establishing the procedures and technigues to be used later in per-
forming the remote maintenance. The fuel pump rotary element and motor,
the primary heat exchanger, one of the cell space coolers, and several

heater assemblies were removed and replaced remotely.

Preoperational Testing of Auxiliary
Egquipment and Systems

Cleaning and test procedures were written for each system or sub-
system before and during the construction period by the Reactor Division

quality control group.

Water System

As sections of the cooling-water systems were completed, the piping,
valves, pumps, flowmeters, etc., were flushed out, leaktested, and given
a preliminary check for pump ocutput, etc. by CPFF craftsmen and witnessed
by Reactor Division quality control personnel. When the entire water sys-
tem was completed, the total system was given a preliminary checkout.
After preliminary testing, the system was turned over to the MSRE opera-

tions group.
15

Instrument Air System

After completion of the instrument system, each line was taken loose
from the instrument and the entire piping system was blown down. The
filters were changed and the piping was reconnected. A leak test was then
performed on the total system. Flowmeters, pressure switches, etc., were
tested for performance and accuracy. The preoperational testing was per-
formed by CIPFF craftsmen and witnessed by the Reactor Division quality
control people who wrote the test procedures. Test results were docu-
mented and records are on file in the MSRE Maintenance Engineert's office.

Preoperational testing of other auxiliary systems was performed in

essentially the same manner,

MATNTENANCE

Maintenance 1is a vital part of any facility and was especially so in
the Molten-5alt Reactor Experiment. As mentioned earlier in this report,
one of the major objectives of the MSRE was to demonstrate its maintain-
ability so that reactor downtime could be kept to g minimum. Because of
this, planning, scheduling, procurement, and necessary design changes

Played a vital role in the overall operation.
Routine and Programmed (Preventive) Maintenance

Just prior to the completion of the MSRE, ORNL had set up a mainte-
nance system called "Programmed Maintenance.' This required that mainte-
nance to be performed on a piece of equipment be specified and fed into
the K-25 TEM computer. At a predetermined frequency, IBM cards were de-
livered to the foreman who was to perform the work. After considering the
alternate maintenance programs, it seemed advisable to make use of this
program.

Accordingly a master list of all equipment in the MSRE system was
compiled, and in cooperation with the operations group, an estimate was
made on the percentage of time the equipment would be in use. Then, with

the manufacturer's maintenance manual as a guide, a maintenance program
16

for each piece of equipment was listed and fed into the IEM computer.
This listing included a description of the eqguipment, frequency of service,
maintenance to be performed, type of lubricant, etec.

The maintenance cards were delivered (approximately one week in ad-
vance of the scheduled maintenance date) to the MSRE Maintenance Engineer,
who initiated a work request. The work request, with the TEM card at-
tached, was directed to the E&E Craft Supervisor. A copy of the work re-
quest and the maintenance card were issued to the operations Shift Super-
visor. The Shift Supervisor shut down and tagged out the equipment at
the request of the FE supervisor. The maintenance was performed by the
craftsmen, and in most cases, depending on the nature of the job, was
witnessed by a representative of the Reactor Division quality control
group or by the craft foreman. (Examples of this were the witnessing of
the preventive maintenance performed on the component cooling blowers;
the lubrication and tensioning of the drive belt; and the leaktesting of
the dome flange. All this work was performed according to predetermined
procedures.) Adjustments were made from time to time of frequency, type
of lubricant, etc.

According to the feedback received from those who used the mainte-
nance cards, the program appears to be relatively economical. Many pro-
blems were noted in time to prevent major breakdown and repairs; however,
it appears more refinement of the program is needed, especially with re-

spect to freguency.
Shutdown Maintenance

For the most part, MSRE shutdowns were preplanned and scheduled. The
following describes the planning and scheduling methods used. 1In general,

the same methods were followed for nonscheduled shutdowns.

Planning

Trmediately after a reactor startup, planning was started for the
next shutdown. In most cases, a target date was set for completion of a
run based on the need for inspection of the core specimens. As operating
experience dictated, proposed changes and modifications were added to the

list. Equipment repairs were added as the occasion warranted.
L7

Procurement and design were started as soon as practical after the
need arose. Procedures or Jjob descriptions were written well in advance
of the shutdown to allow time for everyone involved to become familiar
with the tasks to be performed.

Information and planning mettings were held with the craftsmen and
supervisors., For some remote maintenance tasks, mockups were built, and
training and practice sessions were held with craftsmen, supervisors, and

Reactor Division quality control representatives.

Scheduling

The list of work to be performed was detailed and firmed up as far
in advance of the shutdown as possible. The critical path method was used
for showing the sequence and estimated duration of each task, such as
design, procurement, writing of procedures, practice sessions, installa-
tion, and testing., The sequences of work were established as a joint
effort of the operations and maintenance group. Estimates of job duration
were made by the EFE supervisors.

As work progressed, more tasks were usually added to the list, and
because of this the schedule was updated periodically. This method of
scheduling proved to be very satisfactory, and the estimates became more
accurate as time progressed. On the last few shutdowns, estimates were

correct to within approximately 5%.
Witnessing the Critical Shutdown Work

Critical tasks, such as remote maintenance, repairs or modifications
to component cooling pumps, main blowers, radiator door lifting mechanism,
etc., were observed and coordinated by Reactor Division guality control
personnel, Procedures and job descriptions were modified as required so
that they reflected the actual work performed and therefore were more
nearly accurate for similar future tasks. A checkoff list was used to
assure that all was in order before equipment or systems were reacti-

vated after each maintenance period (see example in App. M).
18
SUMMARY OF QUALITY CONTROL PRACTICES

Quality control procedures were formulated for all critical work not
covered by existing codes and procedures, and record forms were designed,
if they did not exist, for documenting critical inspection and testing.
Inspectors were traired (to some degree) for following and documenting
the work. Coordination of quality control and craft effort was difficult

in the early stages but improved as the job progressed.
(VERALL CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Basic quality control procedures should be standardized for the whole
laboratory as soon as practical, Specific procedures for a project should
be formulated and agreed upon as soon as possible after criteria and speci-
fications are written. The project quality control director should be
intimately involved in formulating specific procedures not covered by the
various codes. Assembly of the quality control procedures incorporating
existing codes and specific detailed procedures should be accomplished
through the joint efforts of the several quality control groups and the
designer and specification writers, All quality control procedures and
specifications should be ircorporated into one manual. Adequate forms
for documenting quality contrel should be designed prior to the beginning
of work.

The quality control rersonnel (inspectors) should be responsible to
the project gquality control director, and they should have authority to
direct craft superviscrs to stop work not being performed according to
the specifications. If the standards specified in quality control pro-
cedures are to be met, those who perform the work and those who witness
that performance must be adequately trained. To accomplish this, quality
control inspectors should be formally trained, tested, and certified, and
craftsmen and craft superviscrs should receive basic training in quality
control procedures and practices.

If this phase of the effort is viewed with the respect it is due,
there is every reason tc believe that the construction and tesfing of a
reactor system can be performed smoothly and efficiently and that the

startup of the reactor should be relatively trouble-free,

PRECAUTIONS

For preparing and cleaning base metal and weld beads, use cutting
tools, hand tools, grinding wheels, and stainless steel wire brushes
that are free of foreign material and that have not been used on
low-melting metals (Zn, Sn, Pb, etc.), and alloys (brass, brazing
alloys, solder, etc.) that contain these metals.

Use suitable clean solvents that conform to job specifications. Do
not use marking paint or crayon, temperature-indicating crayon, and
cutting fluid containing sulfur.

PREPARATION OF BASE METAL

Produce the weld joint geometry shown in the applicable detail on
Joint Welding Schedule and drawing.

Before preparing a weld joint surface on arc-cut or oxygen-cut base
metal, machine or grind to remove irregularities and 0.100 in. add-
itional metal from the cut face.

Remove burrs, laps, gouges, and other defects from shearing, sawing,
etc. to produce smooth weld joint surfaces.

Remove scale and oxide within 1 in. of each edge of the weld joint.
Remove o0il, moisture, chips, and other foreign material from weld
joint and from base metal within 10 in. of each side of the joint.

Heat treat to stress relieve severely cold worked base metal. Contact
engineer if heat treatment procedure is not covered in job specifi-
cation.

Immediately before welding, inspect joint for foreign material by
wiping with clean white cloth, damp with solvent. Reclean as required.

ASSEMBLY AND FIXTURES

 

Provide suitable fixtures to support and align parts during weld-
ing without excess restraint on the weld. Use welded-on temporary
attachments only where necessary.

Clean fixture within 10 in. of each side of weld joint.

Set up parts as shown on Joint welding Schedule and drawing.

Provide suitable baffles on root side of joint to confine and prevent
contamination of the backing gas.

WELDING TECHNIQUE

Before welding, use at least 5 volume changes of Ar backing gas to re-
move air. Continue flow until weld thickness is sufficient that
the underside is not heated to oxidizing temperature during welding.

Place torch in welding position, start Ar preflow and purge air from
gas lines, torch, and arc-strike area.

Strike arc by means of high-frequency spark or by light touch of
electrode in weld groove or on a copper block. Start arc at low
current; when arc is stable, upslope current to welding level.

Hold torch perpendicular to joint or slightly slanted (0-15°), with
electrode pointed normally in direction of travel. Move torch at a
constant rate in direction of travel with minimum oscillation if
necessary. Maintain short arc length. Regrind or replace electrode
when necessary to maintain required tip shape and to remove metal
pickup and oxide.

Wipe welding rod with clean cloth and solvent. Hold rod 10-30° from
base metal. Begin adding welding rod as soon as a small weld pool

is present. Add rod at a constant rapid rate into the leading edge
of the pool. Do not fuse base metal or weld metal without adding rod.
Deposit string beads. Keep end of rod in the shielding gas. Remove
oxidized ends of used rods.

Travel upward when axis of weld is not level.

Before breaking arc, fill crater and reduce weld pool to smallest
possible size by downsloping current.

Maintain postflow until weld bead is below oxidizing temperature.
CLEANING OF WELD BEADS

Remove all oxide (particles and film) from crater, weld beads, and

base metal in the line of arc travel, before depositing each section

of bead and from each completed weld bead.

PEENING

Do not peen weld beads or base metal.

DEFECTS ~

Examine each weld bead and each crater for cracks, pin-holes, incom-
plete fusion, incomplete penetration, overlap, undercut, narrow
grooves, tungsten inclusions, heavy oxide or scale, and other defects.

Check that fillet size and butt weld reinforcement conform to job ®
specification. Check that all beads have normal smooth surface and
contour, and merge smoothly with each other and with base metal.

Remove weld defects by grinding, filing, or machining.

Before depositing each bead, examine weld groove and adjacent base
metal for cracks, laminations, holes, and other defects.

Report to Foreman defects in base metal and any other condition that
might reduce weld quality.

BACK-GROOVING

Before welding the second side of double-welded joints, machine or
grind the back of the root to remove defects.

POSTWELD HEAT TREATMENT
Postweld heat treatment was not incorporated in procedure qualification.
WELDER IDENTIFICATION

Record welder identification for each weld. Do not die stamp base
metal or weld.

INSPECTION

When the Welding Inspector believes inspection necessary, he will
examine base metal or welds at any stage of fabrication; and when

he has reason to question that this Procedure is being followed,

the ability of the welder, or weld quality, he may require supple-
mental inspection, corrective action, or requalification of the welder.

Subject: Cleaning and Storing of Pipe and Fittings to be Used in MSRE
Construction

The pipe and fittings will be stored in B.M. Stores at X-10, Attention:

E. A. Wallace. At a later date part of the material will be stored at 7503
Building. Upon receipt of the material, the B.M. storekeeper will notify

the 7000 Area pipe shop foremen who will furnish craftsmen to clean, cap,

and return the material to Stores. The shop foreman will notify Inspection
Engineering in order that they may witness the cleaning. Inspection Engineering
will furnish and fill out a cleaning inspection form¥* and will forward copies

to J. T. Beall, E. A. Wallace, and B. H. Webster. The material will be cleaned
at the 7000 Ares Cleaning Facility by the focllowing method:

Cleaning Procedures for Pipe and Fittings to be Used in MSRE
Construction

Upon receipt of material at the Cleaning Facility, it is visually
inspected for cleanliness. If grease, oll, or dirt is present, the
material is washed with acetone, hot water, or blown with air to
remove the excess.

The material is then lowered into a vat of five per cent tri-sodium
phosphate (100 pounds of technical grade TSP to 280 gallons potable
water) at 80°C. This solution is cireculated through the vat at 60
gallons per minute. The inlet line is arranged so as to allow maximum
flow through pipe being cleaned. The material is to remain in this
solution for one-half hour minimum.

The material is then lowered into a vat of cold potable water. The
potable water flows through the vat at 50 gallons per minute and is
continuously discharged to waste. The material is rinsed in this vat
for one-half hour.

The material is then lowered into a vat of hot circulated potable
water (80°C) at 20 gpm for one-half hour. It is then removed to a
rack where it is air dried with 90°C filtered air.

Distribution -2- October 19, 1962

The material is then finally inspected for cleanliness and remarked
if the identification was removed during cleaning. Material is to
be remarked by etching, pipe is to be marked on twelve inch (12")
centers, and fittings marked in two places.

If possible, the material will be delivered to E. A. Wallace or to
7503 Stores the same day it is cleaned.

All materials that pass through the Cleaning Facility are logged
in and out. The following information is recorded in the operations

General: Preliminary arrangements have been made with the Stores department
to set up a store in the compressor building just west of T503. X-10 Stores
will furnish a storekeeper to issue materials, keep records, and maintain
inventory during the construction period and possibly during the operation
and maintenance of the MSRE.

Shelves and bins for materials will be furnished by the stores department.

Final arrangements should be made with stores approximately 60 days prior to
the completion date of the contract work in order that the store will be
ready when the ORNL forces are ready to start work in the building.

A. Materials to be Stored

1. Miscellaneous Non-critical Supplies

(a) protective clothing

(b) decontamination equipment and materials
(¢c) small tools

(d) insulation, etc.

2. Critical Materials

Critical materials include all pipe, valves, gages, tubing, and
fittings of any type or material and all INOR and SS material of
any shape or description.

3. BSemi-critical Materials

(a) heaters
(b) electrical disconnects
(e¢) M.I. cable, etc.

B. Receipt of Material
1. All c¢ritical material must be approved by Inspection Engineering.

2. A copy of the materials history must accompany the material to be
stored; this record will show:

Type of Material

Heat No.

IR No.

Cleaning Record

Test Records, etc. (Whatever records may be applicable
to the material in question).

3, Critical materials will not be accepted unless the above mentioned
conditions are met.

4. Non-critical materials may be placed in the store at the discretion of
the storekeeper and project materials control representative.
23

W. B. McDonald -3 Octcber 17, 1962

5.

Semi-critical materials will have been inspected and accepted at the
vendor's and may be stored as they are received providing records are
presented with the material or equipment.

Rules for Issuing Materials

L.

L.

Critical and semi-critical materials will be issued only on the
signature of cne of the following: J. T. Beall, L. P. Pugh, ¥. T.
Anderson, H. J. Klemski, J. P. Jarvis, W. D. Todd, J. W. Teague,
C. K. McGlothlan; B. E. Webster,; R. S. Jackson, P. Leinart.

Materials listed as critical will not be available to project personnel
(including E and M people)} from any source other than the 7503 Store.
Preliminary discussions with the X-10 Stores Supervisor indicate

that limitsations can be placed on the type of material that can be
bought on any given work order number from the regular X-10 Stores.

Respcnsibility will be assigned to one person to see that unused
criftical materiszl is sent to Inspection Engineering for rechecking
or returned to Stores.

Nen-critical meterials may be bought at X-10 Stores; however, an
attempt will be made to store as many items as possible in the 7503
Stcres. These items wili bte issued in the normal manner.

Records

Receiving reports, inspection reports, cleaning records, etc., will be
turned cver to a project materials control representative after material
is sccepted by Stores.

Speciai forms* will be provided for issuing critical and semi-critical
material. These forms will te made out in duplicate, one copy tc te
retained by the stcrekeeper as an assist in maintaining the proper
inventory,; and one copy turned over to the project materials control
represertative t¢ he kept cn file along with receiving reports,
inspection repcrts, etc.

=

e sturekeeper will maintain a pre-determined inventory of non-
ritical materials by whatever method is normally used by the stores
department. .

Materials Which Have Been Analyzed for Use on INOR-8 and Stainless
Steel for the Mclten-Salt Reactor Experiment

Distribution

B. H. Webster -

ABSTRACT

During the fabrication and installation of the MSRE a number of
commercial products were analyzed to determine what would be accept-
able as cleaning agents, lubricants, insulation, threading and tapping
compounds, etc., on INOR-8 and stainless steel materials. All of these
commercial items were analyzed for sulphur, since we have found sulphur
to be extremely harmful to INOR-8. It may be noted that mest items were
analyzed for low-melting metals and alloys which are also harmful to
INOR~8 under certain condtions. This listing is submitted with the

hope that it will be beneficial to other groups in the Laboratory.
