DEVELOPMENT OF A MODEL FOR COMPUTING 12%Xe
MIGRATION IN THE MSRE

- R. J. Kedl A. Houtzeel

Abstract

 The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) is a fluid-

fueled reactor with a potential as a thermal breeder. Because
of the importance of neutron economy to the breeder concept, it
is necessary to know the dynamics of 135%e in the 01rculat1ng—

- fuel system. There are several "sinks" where xenon may be de-
posited from the fuel, notably in the gas space of the pump

- bowl and in the voids of the unclad graphite of the reactor
core. Since *?%Xe in the core impairs the neutron economy, it
is important to understand the mass transfer mechanism involved
and the parameters that may be varied to control it.

This report deals prlmarlly with developing 'a model for
computing the migration of. 135%e in the MSRE and with experi-
ments conducted to establish the model. A preoperational ex-
periment ‘was ‘run in the MSRE with 85kr tracer, and many of the
gas~-transport constants were 1nferred from the results. Equiva- .
lent transport constants for calculatlng the *35Xe migraticn

- “gave & poisoning of about 1. 4% without circulating bubbles and
well below 1% with bubbles. Preliminary measurements made on
the critical reactor show xenon poisoning of 0.3 to 0.4%. Slnce
1phys1cal measurements confirm that there are bubbles in the sys-
tem, the conclusion is drawn that the computation model, the
krypton experlment and reactor operatlon agree.

The goal of the Molten Salt Reactor Program is to develop an effi-
01ent power-produclng, thermal—breedlng reactor. The Molten Salt Reactor
Exper1ment (MSRE) is one step toward that goal, although it is not a

breeder. Nuclear p01sons, notably 135Xe, can detract S1gn1f1cantly from

fthe breed1ng potentlal It was therefore con31dered approprlate to in-

:vestigate in some detall the dynamlcs of noble gases 1n th1s pllot-plant-

scaled reactor and w1th thls 1nformatlon to predlct quantltatlvely the _
xenon p01soning.%v: } _ _
The 135%e polsonlng is a functlon of the steady-state 135Xe concen-

'tratlon 1n the reactor core.‘ It is computed by balanclng the rates as—

'soclated w1th the varlous source and s1nk terms 1nvolved. Slnce the MSRE

is fluid fueled, xenon and iodine are generated directly in the salt, ‘and

 
 

 

 

the source term is essentially a constant.  The sink terms, however, are
more complex. Xenon may be removed from the system via a stripping de- '

vice, it can decay or be burned up in the-éalt, or it may be absorbed by

. the graphite and ultimately decay or burn up. Xenon may also be absorbed

by circulating helium bubbles, which complicate the model because of
their relatlvely unknown dynamics.
This report is concerned principally W1th developing a model for

estlmatlng the 135%e p01son1ng in the MSRE. waever, the first part dls-

cusses. an experiment, referred to as the krypton experiment, in which

some of the more elusive rate constants were evaluated.’

DESCRIPTION OF THE MSRE
The MSEE is a circulating-fluid-fueled graphite;moderated{single-

region reactor. The fuel consists of uranium fluoride dissolved in a
mixtume of lithium, beryllium, and zirconium fluorides. The normal oper=-
ating temperature is 1200°F, and the thermal power level is 7.5 Mw. The
reactor system consists of a primary loop containing the core and a sec-
ondary loop to remove the heat. Our ‘concern is only with the primary
loop, & schematic diagram of which is shown in Flg. 1. EsSentiaily it
consists of a pump, heat exchanger, ‘and reactor core. A detailed de-
seription of the MSRE is contained in Ref. 1, and pertinent design pa-'
remeters are listed in Appendix A. ~

" Figure 2 shows details of the fuel pump. It is rated for 1200 gpm
at a 48.5-f% head.' The volute is completeiy enclosed in a vessel re-
ferred to as the pump bowl, which serves prlmarlly as an expansion vol-
ume for the fuel salt. The overflow tank serves as an additional expan-

51on volume for the system.and is fed by an overflow llne that penetrates

up 1nto the pump bowl. The normal operatlng hellum.pressure in the pump

bowl is 5 psig, which is also the pump suctlon pressure. -There is a
continuous flow of salt and hellum.through the pump bowl. The pr1nc1pal

salt flow is through the xenon strlpper, which is a toroid contalnlng

numerous small holes that spray salt through the hellum atmosphere. The -

'"salt flow is controlled with an orifice and has been calcu;ated to be

porous structure; the graphlte acts as & 13%Xe concentrator in the core.
The theoretical void. percentage of MSRE graphite (grade CGB) is 17. 7%,
and slightly over half of it is accessible to a gas such as xenon.2
Other pertinent properties of this graphite are listed in Appendix A,

and more detailea information is available in Refs. 3 and’é. The rate

- at which 135Xe diffuses to the graphite.is a function of the salt-to-

graphite mass transfer. coeffr01ent Whlch is, in turn, a function of the

- fuel-salt Reynolds number.

The moderator reglon can be d1V1ded into three fluid dynamic regions

of interest. First there 1s_the bulk of the graph1te_(~95%), which is

characterized by salt velocities of about 0.7 ft/sec and a Reynolds num-

ber of about 1000. One would expect laminar flow; however, the entrance

to these channels is orificed end quite tortuous because of a layEr of
graphite grid bars across the bottom of the moderator that are used to
space and support the core blocks. The effective mass trahsfer coeffi-
cient is probably somewhere between the coefficients for laminar flow
and turbulent flow. The second fluid dynamic region is composed of the
centermost channels in the core (about 18). : They do not have orificing
grid bars below them, so the fuel velocities are higher, about 1.8 ft/sec,
and give a Reynolds number of about 2500. Accordingly the mass transfer
coefficient is higher than for the bulk of the graphite and is for tur-
bulent flow. This region comprises about 1.5%_of the graphite and is in
a zone of high nuclear importance. The third“fluidtdynamic region is

the cherulayer of graphite grid bars mentioned above, which do the ori-

~ ficing. These grid bars are subject to high salt velocities, a maximum

of about 5 ft/sec, and comprise a fluid dynamic entrance region. In ad-
dition, the jets formed by the grid bars impinge on the bottom.of the

core blocks. The entire region then is subject to much higher mass trans-
fer coefficients than the bulk graphite."This region is not too well
defined but probably comprises about 3.5% of the total graphite. It is

in a zone of very low nuclear importance.

KRYPTON-85 EXPERIMENT

‘Deseription of the Problem

Xenon-135 p01son1ng in the MSRE was. cons1dered prev1ously,5__7 but

cthese calculatlons were generally of an approx1mate design nature be-:

cause of lack of 1nfbrmat1on on the values of the rate constants in-
volved.: In order to calculate the steady -state 135Xe poisoning in the

reactor, it was first necessary to compute the }35Xe concentration dis-~

~solved in the salt. This was done by equating the various source and
_sink rate terms involved and solv1ng for the xenon concentration.. The

_ most signlflcant 135Xe source term 1s that Wthh comes from the decay

of 1351 in addition a small amount is produced dlrectly from fission.

The sink terms are discussed in some detail later, but we will initially

consider only the following terms and their associated rate constants:

timately be burned up, de-
cay, or be stripped in the

pump bowl

The stripping efficiency of the pump bowl spray ring was measured
at the University of Tennessee as part of a mesters dégree thesis.8»?
This ﬁork was done with a COg-ﬁater system maintained bubble free and
later confirmed with and O,-water system, also maintained bubble free.

A prototype of the xenon stripper was used in these tests. It was felt

desirable to check the results with & xenon and sal# system, particulériy

with circulating bubbles present. )
Xenon-135 burnup and decay rates are relatively well known. Migra-
tion of xenon to graphite is controlled-by the mass transfer coefficient
and by the diffusion coefficient of xenon in graphite; The mass trans-

- fer coefficient can be estimated from heat-mass transfer anaiogies (see
Appendix C), but the unknown mode of fluid flow (lamiﬁar or turbulent);
'the unwettability of graphite by molten salt, the question of mass trans-
fer to a porous surface rather than s continuous SurfaCe, and some natu-
ral resistance toward assuming a high degree of reliability for the heat-
mass transfer analogies made the estimated coefficients seem questionable.

The quantitative-effect of circﬁlatihg bubbles was almost completely

- unknown, except that their effect would be prominent because of the ex-

tremely low solubility of xenon in salt. In addition there may be other
effects not considered. Generally fhe state of knowledge of the rate
constants was considered somewhat wanting. Each of these rate constants
could be investigated individually in the laboratory, but this would Sé
too expensive and time consuming. Rather, after other approaches were
considered, it was decided to conduct a single summary experiment on the
reactor and extract as many of the rate constants as possible, or at
least set limits on them. The experiment was referred to as the krypton

experiment.

_ Description of the Experiment

 

Essentially the experiment was divided into two phases and took place
during the précritical period of MSRE operations. The first phaSe was
an addition phase and consisted of adding ®°Kr to one of the pump-bowl
level-indicator bubbler lines at a steady rate for a period of time. Dur- -
ing this phase tpe pump bowl reached some equilibrium 85Ky concentration:
almost immediately; then the salt dissolved krypton via the xenon-strip-
per sprayfring;‘and the graphite absorbed krypton from the salt. The
second'phasé'began by turning off the krypton flow but maintaining all
bubbler and purge helium flows. Then the reverse processéS'took place.
The pump bowl purged clean of kryptoﬁ; the'salt ﬁas stripped; and finally
the graphite was leached. During the entire experiment the off-gas line

wes monitored cdntinuously with a radiation counter. By analyzing the

krypton cdnCentration‘decay rate i the off-gas during the stripping

phase of the experiment, we evaluated some of the rate constants in-
volved. The experiment'had'the advantage of evaluating the actual reac-

tor under operating conditions rather than models underrsimulated con-

‘ditions. The experiment had the limitation that several parameters had

to.be evaludted from esséntially:a single set of data and were therefore

subject to a certain'amouht_ofjpersonal'interprétation. Also, transient

experimehts are inherentlyfmorewdifficult to analyze than steady-state
experiments. Krypton-85 was chosen for the experiment primarily for ease

of continuous monitoring at low concentrations in the off-gas line; also

its low cost and availability were considerations.

Figure 5 is a schematic diagram of the krypton experiment‘facilities.
Bésically, it consists of an addition station ahd a monitoring station.
The'additioﬁ station controls the flow of aﬁ 8 5Kr-He mixture into bubbler
line 593. The normal bubbler flow of Pure helium (0.37 std liters/min)
was maintained to transﬁort the krypton-helium mixture into the pump bowl.
The reactor contains two bubblers. The second bubbler was used to;per-
form its various reactor control functions. |

- The krypton-helium container was'made‘from 12-in. sched.-80 carbon
steel pipe and pipe caps and was about 5 ft long. It was hydrostatically
tested at 520 psig. On one end was a‘U-tube and valve arrangement that
was used,to transfer &%Kr from its shipping container to the experiment
container. The transfer was accomplished by first evacuating the experi-

, ment container and then opening the valve on the shippihg container. This
‘fesulted in about 95% trdnsfer. The remginihg krypton was transferred by

using the U-tube as & cold trap and freezing it with liquid nitrogen.

- This two-step procéss resulted in the almost perfect transfer of the 120

curies of 8%Kr purchased. The experiment container was then pressurized
to 180 psig with helium. - After the first run it was further pressurized
with helium to 275 psig. Dilution was necessary in order to have enough

gas to measure and control adequately. The original 120 curies of 85Ky

- amounted to only about two iiters, and this had to be added continuously

to the reactor for a period of several days.

Based on experience of the personnel in tﬁe Isotopes Division of
ORNL, krypton mixed with helium will tend to settle out over a period
of time. To counter this effect the krypton-helium container was equipped
with & hermetically sealed agitator. It consisted of an 8-in. aluminum
ball inside the tank that rolled back and forth as the tank was rocked.
A large coil of 1/4-in. stainless steel tubing was located between the
krypton-helium container-and flow control equipment to compensate for
the rocking motion. The limiting fldw valve was set to limit the flow
from the container to about 20 std liters/hr in case of a complete rup-
ture downstream. The-remaindei.of7the_flow control system consisted of
conventional filters (5 to 9 u), pressure'gagéé, and low-capacity valves.
The flowmeter was a Hanovef-matrix type and was calibrated for various
outlet pressures. |

As shown in Fig. 5, all the reactor off-gas from the pump bowl went
through the monltorlng station. It could pass through either one of two
identical monitors or a bypass line. The monitors were labeled A and B.
Monitor B was used for all runs.: Monitor A was intended as a spare but
was never neéded. They were designed for a range of five decades of ac-

tiViﬂy. 'Each consisted of four amperex ‘90NB GM tubes, which were shlelded

as follows:

12

The four GM tubes were suSpended in a 2-liter stainless steel labo-

ratory'beaker.- The monitors were calibrated with small samples of 8 5kr.

- During the first run of the experiment, it was found that the plastic
shielding on GM tube No., 2 sbsqrbed 85kr and gave a false count rate;

also it affected other tubes in the array. To correct fbr this, the plas-

‘tic was removed and GM tube No. 2 became identical with tube No. 1.. The

GM output was fed into a decade scaler and a count rate meter. The de-
cade scaler was used for recording data, and the count rate meter was
used for experiment control assistance.’ ‘

Much considerstion’was givén,to the safety aspect of handling'120-
curies of 8%Kr. The half-life of 8°Kr is 10.3 y and it gives off 0.695-
and 0.15-Mev beta particles and a 0.54-Mev. gamma ray. The daughter prod-
uct is 87Rb, which is stable. The area in which the experiment was con-
ducted was equipped with radiation detectors. and air monitors. A con-
tinuous flow of air (17,000 to‘20,000 cfm).ﬁas maintained through the re-
actor building and released to the atmosphere through a 100-ft stack.:
Bricks were stacked around the krypton-hslium tank, and the activity level
outside the bricks was negligible. Special beta-sensitive monitor badges
were worn by personnel operating the experimént. Detailed procedures for
transferring 85Kr, pressurizing the container, and conducting the additidn
and stripping phases of the experiment were written and approved by ap-

propriate personnel.

Procedure and Description of Runs

The procedure used to start the addition phase was to adjust the

- krypton-helium container regulator so that the pressure gage Just up-

stream of the main flow control valve was about 10 psig, that is, about

- 5 psi over the pump bowl pressure. The flow rate was then controlled

with the main flow control valve. During the addition phase the system
was checked every 1/2 to 1 hr, and the flow control was adjusted as nec-
essary to maintain a constant activity in the off-gss line. The krypton~-
helium container was agitated for about 15 min every 2 to 4 hr. For
various runs the krypton-helium injection rate ranged from 2 to 6.3 std

liters/hr but was held constant for each run.

Zero time in the procedure was defined as the time when the krypton-
helium flow was turned.off. This was accqmplished by closing the krypton-
off valve and then the regulating valve. It took a minute or so before
the monitor started dropping_because all the lines had to be purged. At
the start ef the stripping phase, a l-min count was taken every 1 1/2 min.
The times gradually increased until at the end of the long runs (2 and
3) a 1/2-hr count was teken every hour. Note from Fige. 1 and 2 that
there are two essentially stagnant lines entering the pump bowl, the sam-
pler-enricher line and the overflow line. These lines were purged free
of 8%Kr before the stripping phase sterted and at various times during
the stripping operation.

Six 85Kr addition and stripping runs were made. Table 1 summarizes
the operational parameters ih these runs. Figures 6 through 11 show the
results of these runs. The count rate in the off-gas monitor is plotted
against time during the stripping phase and has been corrected for dead
time of the GM tubes. No correction was necessary for the decay of 8 5Ky
because its-half-life is so leng compaied with the time scale of each
run. As pointed out previously, the data from run 1 are erroneous be-
cause of &%Kr absorbed on the plastic ehielding s GM tube 2. This plas-
tic was removed for subsequent runs. Nevertheless, as an added check,
the monitors were purged periodically with pure helium, and a background
count was measured. In all cases after run 1 the background count for
tubes 3 and 4 was less then 15 cpm. |

ANAIYSIS OF THE ®°Kr EXPERIMENT

General Approach

 

Analysis of the 8 5Ky experiment is concerned with the stripping
phase of the runs. The principal stripping processes involved, in order
of occurrence, are purging the pump bowl, stripping the salt and asso-
ciated circulating bubbles (if present), and then leaching the graphite.
Other leaching processes of no fundamental interest but of importance
because they contribute to the measured flux decay curve are diffusion
out of the stagnant bubbler kidney described earlier and leaching 85kr
that may have been trapped in gas pockets located in the primary loop.
Locations of potential gas pockets in the loop are in the freeze flanges,

graphite access port, and the spaces formed by the assembly of the core

blocks. There are various bits of evidence that pockets actually exist,
although their 1ocation:and-capacity-are.not,certain.-

The fuel-salt circuit time around the loop is 25 sec, which is short
compared with the time scale of the stripping process involved, so the
fuel loop can be considered as a well-stirred pot.{’At,any specific time
therefore, the krypton concentration is considered to be constant through-
outathe,loop. In the simplest case, it can be shown that each transient

stripping process, when unaffected by any other stripping process, will-

- obey an exponential decay law; that is at time %,

Kr flux_ = Kr flux_ i

- In the actual case, however, each stripping process will affect every

other stripping process to a greater or lesser extent. Note that pump

" bowl purging, salt Stripping,'and graphite leaching are series processes;

that is)_they occur in the sequence given; while leachings of the several
graphite regions are parallel processes; that is, they occur simulta-
neously after the krypton concentration in the salt starts to drop. Quali-

" tatively, the measured decay curve would be expected to be the sum of the

contributions of each leaching process, as shown in Fig. 12. Note that

on the remaining data was then determined and_again subtracted. This
procedure was repeated to a logicalféonclusion; that is, until continued
subtracting from the data gave negligible values. This procedure for

run 3 resulted in five exponehtials,‘which is somewhat, significant be-
cause of the five major stripping operations (pump bowl, salt, including
bubbles, and three gr@phite regions). This general approach is in error
in that it assumes that each stripping process starts at zero time and
proceeds independently at all others. It will be seen, however, that this
approach is adequate for both the very slowest rate constant prodésses
(leaching bulk graphite) and the very fastest rate constant processes

(purging pump bowl), but it is inadequate for intermediate processes

(stripping salt and faster rate constant graphite). Figure 14 shows the

results of this exponentiallpeeling process on run 3. The rate constants
are a function only of the slopes of the exponentials involved, so abso-
lute calibrations of the monitor and detailed knowledge of the ®°Kr con-

centrations are not necessary. Numerical results of peeling run 3 and

their interpretation are given in Tablé 2. This ‘approach to analyzing
the data was the principal method used. It is of necessity confined to
the fastest and slowest rate procesées ﬁnvolved. But when applied to

these proCesses, the results have a high degree of reliability, as will

| be seen.

A second method of analy51s of the data was undertaken primarily as
an attempt to determine rate constants for the intermediate processes in-
volved,_Such as stripping efficiency ahd'mass transfer to the faster rate
constant graphite regions. In this approach, unsteady-state differential
equatlons were set up" around the pump bowl gas phase, fuel salt, and
three graphite regions. The resulting flve equatlons could be solved
simultanedusly for the rate constants involved. Physically this was done

with a computer, and the rate constants were solved for by the method of

~ steepest. ascént. The approach'was not too successful, probably for the

In the first term C~ is the mean ®%Kr concentration in the gas phase of
the pump bowl and the product Ec: is the concentration in the off-gas

term represents the rate at which krypton is stripped from the salt,
where S is the stripping efficiency. The third term is the rate at which
.krypton is stripped from the circulating bubbles, where ¥ is the void
- fraction and S/ is the bubble stripping efficiency.

If these three terms are evaluated at the beginning of the‘stripping
phase, the second term is approximately 1/500 of the first term, so it

“can be neglected. The third term is about 1/20 or less of the first term

for expected values of ¥ and S/. It must be neglected because of inade-
quate knowledge of V¥ and S8/. The error introduced, however, will not be
great. The above equation also neglects the 85Ky contribution by the

Xénon Stripper Efficiency

As pointed out previously, values for the stripping efficiency could
not be extracted from the data with any degree of accuracy, even though
runs 4 5, and 6 were performed with this goal in mind. Very rough cal-
culatlons do indicate that the strlpplng efficiencies are more or less

con81stent with those measured at the Unlver51ty of Tennessee in a 002-

'water system, but the calculations are so approximate and dependent on

hazy assumptlons that they W1ll not be presented here.
~ 'Mass Transfer to Graphite

a;To;review_briefly,the_grephite-regions,;recall that three regions

were identified from fluid dynamic considerations. First there is the

 
 

 

 

30

bulk graphite region (~95%) that is characterized by salt velocities of
about 0.7 ft/seé and a Reynolds number of sbout 1000. The mass transfer
coefficient will be between that for laminar and that for turbulent flow.
Second, there is the graphite éssodiated_with the centermost fuel chan-
nels, which comprises about 1.5% of the graphite. The fuel velocity and
the mass transfer coefficient in this region will be higher than in the
bulk graphite region. Third, thefe is a region of structural graphite
across the bottom of the core. It is difficult to determine the exact
boundary'of'this region, but it probably consisﬁs of approximately 3.5%
of the graﬁhite and is in a zone of low nuclear impgftance. It is char-
acterized by orificing effects, impingement of salt, and fluid dynamic
entrance regions; therefore it will have the highest mass transfer coef-
ficients. | o o

The first questioh to be resolved concerns salt-to—graphite coupling
via the mass transfer coefficient. The krypton flux from the'graphite

can be expressed as

Kr flux from graphite = hﬁAG(cls{i - Cl;) s
where Cgi is conventionally defined as the krypton concentration in the
salt and at the interface, where the interface is continuous. In this
case the salt-gas interface is inside a pore that occupies only a small
fraction of the total graphite surface area. Therefofe we need a rela-
tionship between this concentration at the pore interface and the more
conventional Cgi' This is discussed in Appendix B, where it is shown
that the mean concentration of krypton in a continuous salt film across

the graphite surface is approximately equal to the krypton concentration

in the salt at the salt-gas interface inside a graphite pore.

~ The rate at which 8%Kr is leached from the graphite is a function
of several parameters; for instance, the diffusivity of krypton in graph-

in the bulk salt, which is in turn a function of the xenon stripper effi-
ciency. The general ipproach in the gfaphite analysis will be to first

~ show that this rate is very insensitive to expected values of the dif-

fusion coefficient of krypton in graphite. This being true, we can

determine a relationship between the mass transfer coefficient and the

stripping efficiency, any combination of which will result in a flux curve

- as measured. Then by weighting this relationship with the value of strip-

ping efficiency measured at the University of Tennessee, theoretical
values for the mass transfer coefficient (see Appendix C), and other con-
siderations, we ﬁill obtain a very narrow range of possible values for
the mass transfer coefficient. Generally, this procedure will be fol-
lowed for all the graphite regions considered. Most of the calculations
will be confined to run 3, which was éohéerned primarily with measuring
graphite rate constants. |

Consider the ®%Kr flux from graphite as a function only of its in-
ternal resistance (Dg) and its external resistance (Fﬁ). Also specify
that, for times equal to or greater than zero, the krypton concentration
dissolved in the fuel salt is Zéro. Cylindrical geometry is used; that
is, each core block is considered to be a cylinder, the surface area of
which is equai'to the fuel channel area asSociated with a single core
block. The volume of a graphité cylinder of thié sort is very close to
the volume of the gctual core blocks of the same length. The differen-

tial equation that déséribes this case is

From this equation it can be seen that the krypton flux from any
given grephite region is the sum of a series of exponentials, with the
slope of each exponential being determined by the exponent of e. The.

problem now is one of relating these exponentsito the slopes of the peeled

flux curves. Considering run 3 it is obvious that the slowest exponent
(t1/2 = 198 hr) is related to the bulk graphite, and it is expected that
the next exponential (t1/2 = 15.5 hr) is relafed to the graphite region
located at the center line of the core. The next exponential (t1/2 = 4.52
hr) has a fairly low order of confidence in equating it to any specific
graphite region and wiil not be considered. It can be shown that for
each of the two graphite regions considered, only the first term of the
above series is significant. Therefore the exponent of e can be related
to the measured half-life, as follows:

Now, by evaluating this eguation in conjunction with the eigenfunction
equation, we can relate valueé‘of h and Dg. This was done with the fol-
lowing parameter values, and the results appear in Fig. 17:

t1/2 (bulk graphite) = 198 hr (run 3), |

t1/2 (center-line graphite) = 15.5 hr (run 3),

€ = 0.10,

r, = 0.0905 ft,

H=8.5X 107° moles/cc-atm,

CHRT = 6,43 X 1074, |

The ‘ordinate represents the range in which‘Dg is expected to lie. Note

/ thét:for bulk graphite the value of h;-is almost completely independent

of Dg; therefore the mass transfer coéfficient'is’controlling the krypton
flux from this graphite region. For the center-line graphite region,

the depéndence'of flux on Dg becomes significent only at low values of
Dg. . S | e
It is difficult to extract hﬁ information from run 2 because the
time intervals involved were too short. The krypton addition and strip-
ping‘phaseé were about'60 hr each. .Duringvthis rélatively short addition
timekthe bulk grgphite reached only about 20% of its -saturated value, in
contrast to run 3} where it reached about 70% of its saturated value.

For both runs the center-line graphite region (t1/2 = 15.5 hr in run 3)

slope of the flux curve is not determined by a single graphite ;egioﬂ

but is still under the influence of two graphite regions, and it cannot

be peeled by the same technique as run 3. Nevertheless, run 2 was looked

at, and without presenting any results, it will be stated thét it was

consistent with run 3.

Now, since hﬁ is not a strong function of Dk, we can determine the

G

relationship between hﬁ and S (stripping efficiency). This will be done

for the bulk graphite region after sufficient time so that other tran-

sients are negligible. First, we will make the following rate balance:

of krypton in salt. Iniaddition the expected range of stripping effi-
ciency is outlined.. Note that the calculated curves fall within the ex-
pected range. . | o |

‘In order to pick out more exp11c1t values of th, we can weight this
curve with the following two considerations. First, it is expected that
some circulating bubbles were present, as will be shown in the next sec-
tion on Capacity Consiuerations. Furthermore, it is expected that cir-
culating bubbles increase the effective stripping efficiency to the high
end of the indicated range, and Iikely even highef. Second, most of the
salt‘in the bulk graphite region is of a leminar character, rather than
turbulent, 80 hﬁ? ought to be on the lower end of the expected range.
Therefore, from Fig. 18 and with the above weighting considerations, we
might pick out.a probeble range of h;B to bulk graphiteras

The next graphite region (t1/2'='15;5 hr), interpreted as the center-
line graphite region, is more difficult to handle. The previous deriva-
tion assumes thateall_the krypton dissolved in salt comes from the graph-
ite region under consideration. Now, when working with the center-line
region, we must also considef the krypton dissolved in salt that origi-
nates in the bulk graphite. ‘An equation whose derivation is similar to

The results of this calculation appear on Fig. 18. Also shown is the
theoretical range of hﬁ?L based on turbulént flow and displ&ying'therun-
cértainty in diffusivity of krypton in salt. The equation for hﬁ?L is
invalid at low values of S b¢Cause kﬁ? approaches infinity; hen;g the
lines are terminated as they approach the equivalent line for hm . Nev-
ertheless, it seems that a reasonable range of hﬁPL for the MSRE would

be between 0.25 and 0.4 ft/hr.

Capecity Considerations

In addition to rate constant determinations from slopes of the peeled
exponentials, we should be able to integrate under the curves and deter-
mine information on the capacity of the system. For instance, the inte-
gral of the bulk graphite curve (t1/2 = 198 hr) should yield the approxi-
mate ®°Kr capacity of this graphite. Then, from knowledge of the 8%Kr .
addition concentration, we could compute the approximate grephite void
fraction available to krypton. When this calculation was performed with
the addition concentration taken as the mean pump bowl concentrétion,
the graphite void fraction came out to be sbout 0.40. This is obviously
incorrect, even when the rough nature of the calculation is considered.
The reason for this is that krypton was added through a bubbler, and it
bubbled up through the salt at approximatély one order of magnitude higher
in concentration than in the pump bowl proper. These highly concéntrated
krypton bubbles were caught in the turbulent and recirculating zone formed
by the spray ring. Very likely some of these bubbles, or micro bUbblés,
were cerried into the primary loop énd circulated with thersalt. - The re-
sult was that the concentration of dissolved krypton in the fuel salt was
 

 

 

o

¥a

41

much higher than it would have been based on the mean pump bowl concen-
tration. Now, if we compute the graphite void fraction based on the dis-
solved krypton in the salt being in equilibrium with the bubbler addi-

-tion stream, the result is about 0.04, and this is lower than would be

expected.> The true void fraction is between the limits of what can be

calculated, and insufficient information is available to compute it more

‘accurately. The same is true for all other graphite regions and the fuel

salt, therefore little useful information on capacity is available from
the data. It should be pointed out thet the choice of & bubbler line

for 85K:r-.rzu,rfi.d.:i.’cion as opposed to the pressure reference leg, which would
not have given this deleterious effect, was &ictated by other consider-

ations.

XENON-135 POISONING IN THE MSRE

General Discussion -

To calculate the steady-state 135%e poisoning in the MSRE, it is
first necessary to compute the steady-state 135%e concentration dissolved
in the salt. This is because-the 13%Xe is generated exclusively in the

salt, at least it is assumed to be. The xenon conéentration in the salt

is cdmputed'by equating the sourcé and sink rate terms involved. The
_most Significant of these terms and considerations involving them are

- discussed below.

Dissolved Xenon Sburce Terms and-Considerations |

1. Xenon Direct from Fission. The 135%e generatlon rate dlrect

 

from fission 'is about 0.3% per fission.

2. Xenon from Iodine Decay.j The 1371 generatlon rate is 6.1% per
f13$1on, elther direct or from the decay of 135Te, It in turn decays to.
135Xe with a 6.68-hr half-llfe. The total 135y¢ generatlon rate is there-
fore 6.1 + 0.3 = 6.4% per fission, and, as will be seen from the next

consideration, is confined completely to the salt phase. Since the prin-

“cipal 3%Xe source is from the decay of iodine and since the 35I half-

 
 

 

42 L

life is long compared with the fuel-loop cycle time (25 sec), it will be
assumed that 135Xe is generated homogenecusly throughout the fuel loop.
3. Iodine and‘TelluriuﬁvBehavior. Since 35T and '35Te are pre-
cursors of l35Xe, their chemistry is important. In this model it is as-
sumed that both elements remain in solution as ions, and therefore will
not be removed fromISOlution.by the xenon stripper or diffusion into the
| graphite. Concerning iodine, its thermodyneamic properties indicate this
to bé true.19® Recent evidende from the reactor also indicates this to
be true. Some iodine has been found in the‘off#gas system (but very 1lit-
tle, if any, 135I), but this is due to the volatilization of the precur-
" sor tellurium. Since ?5Te has such a short half-life (<0.5 min), very
little-pf it will have a chance to voletilize; therefore this effect is
neglected. It is also assumed fo} this model that iodine ahd tellurium
will not be absorbed on any internsal reactbr surfaces, such as the con-

tainment metal and graphite.

Dissolved Xenon Sink Terms and Considerations

1. Xenon Decay. Xenon-135 decays with a half-life of 9.15 hr, and
decay takes place throughout the entire fuel lodp. | _

2. Xenon Burnup. Xenon-l1l35 has a neutron absorpﬁion cross section
of 1.18 X 10° barns averaged over the MSRE neutron spectrum.l?! |

3. Xenon Stripper Efficiency. As ﬂoted earlier, the'efficiency of
the xenon stripper was meaéured at the University of TennesSee with a
COg-water systemP and confirmed later with an Os-water systen/l;l2 Both
tests were for a bubble-free system. The measured rate constants were

then extrapolated to a xenon-salt system.?

The stripping,efficiency is
defined as the percent of dissolved gas transférred from the salt to the
gas phase in passing through the xenon stripper spray system. In magni-_
tude it turns out to be between 8 and 15%. | |

4. Xenon Adsorption. Xenon is not adsorbed on graphite signifi-
cantly at these temperatures,'?s1% and it is very unlikely that it will
be adsorbed on metal surfaces. ‘ |

5. Xenon.Migrationhto Grephite. The amount of xenon transferred
to the graphite is & function of the mass transfer coefficient, diffusion

- coefficient of xenon in graphite, and the burnup and decay rate on the
 

 

 

 

 

Fi

43

graphite. During manufacture, this graphite was impregnated several times

-to obtain a low permeability. Diffusion experim.ents2 with a single sam-

ple of CGB graphite yielded a diffusion coefficient of xenon in helium
at 1200°F and 20 psig of about 2.4 X 1077 cm?/sec (9.2 x 10~° f£t2/hr).
This was measured in a single sample of graphite and may not be repre-

sentative of the reactor core; however, it will be seen later that the

poison fraction in the MSRE is not a Strongifunctidn of the diffusivity.

As previously pointed out, the core,graphite may be divided into three
fluid dynamic regions, bulk, center iihe, and lower grid. The krypton
experiment did not yield any reliable information on the lower-grid re-
gion,.and since it is in a region of very low nuclear importance, it will
not be considered. The bulk and center-line regions will, however, be
considered.

6. Xenon Migration to Circulating Bubbles. ‘'As will be seen, the
effect of circulating bubbles iS'very significant because xenon is so
insoluble in salt. Although information on circulating bubbles is meager,
they will be considered.

Other Assumptions and Considerations

1. The '25Xe concentration dissolved in the fuel salt was assumed
to be constant'throughout the fuel loop. From the computed results it
can be shown to change less than 1%. |

2. Tt was assumed that the 13%Xe isotope behaves independently of
all other xenon 1sotopes present. |

3. The 135%e generated in the lamlnar sublayer of salt next to the
graphlte was considered as orlglnatlng in the bulk salt.

4. The core was con51dered as belng composed of 72 annular rlngs,

44

'Average values of parameters such as neutron flux; percent grsphite, mass
transfer coeffioieﬁt, etc., were used for each ring; |
5. The reactor system was assumed to the isothermal at 1200°F.
Consistent with all previogs assumptions, the rate balance of 135%e
dissolved in the fuel salt at steady state is the following:

.Generation rate = Decay rate in salt + burnup rate in salt
+ stripping rate + migration rate to graphite

+ migration rate to circulating bubbles ,

where the units of each term are *3%Xe atoms per unit time. Each term

will now be considered separately.

~Xenon-135 Generation Rate

The total 3°Xe yield is 6.4% per fission. The corresponding 12°Xe
generation rate is 5.44 X 1012 135%e atoms per hour at 7.5 Mw.

Xenon-135 Decay Rate in Salt

The decay of 135%e dissolved in salt is represented as follows:

0.693V_C%
Decay rate in salt = _
- t1/2

Xenon-135 Burnup Rate in Salt

The burnup rate of-135Xe dissolved in salt is expressed incfementally
by dividing the core into the 72 elements described above and is as fol-

lows:

Burnup rate in salt = ;ZL ¢2eo feV'ecs .

Xenon-135 Stripping Rate

Recalling that the stripping efficiency (S) is defined as the per-
centage of 35Xe transferred from salt to helium in passing through the

pump bowl stripper, the strippiﬂg rate is expressed as -
, i _ X
Strlpplng rate = Q,SPSCS .

Xenon-135 Migration to Graphite

Each graphite Qorevblock will be assumed to be cylindrical. This
seems to be a good compromise between the true case and ease of computa-
tion. The surface-to-volume ratio for a cylinder is very close to the
channel surface area-to-volume ratio of the actual core blocks. Diffu-
sion of 135Xe inside cylindrical core blocks at steady state and with a

sink term is as follows:

Xenon-135 Poisoning Calculations

The xenon poisoning as obtained in this report is defined as the

number of neutrons absorbed by 12°Xe over the number of neutrons (fast

~and thermal) absorbed by 235y and weighted according to neutron impor-

15

tance; it is expressed as a percentage. The weighting function is the

adjoint flux. When considering the core incrementally it is given by

where the first term in the numerator is the rate dissolved 135%e is
burned up, the second is the rate 135%e in the graphite is burned up,
and the third is the rate 135Xe in the bubbles is burned up; all terms
are weighted with the adjoint flux. Now, the term representing the rate

With this substltutlon the p01son1ng of 135Xe in the MSRE can be computed.

The react1V1ty coefficient is related to the poisonlng by a constant,

Wlth the equatlons given above,_135Xe poisoning has been computed

for the MSRE for s varlety of conditions subject to the assumptions dis-

cussed earlier. The procedure was to first solve for the steady-state

135%e concentration dissolved in the salt, and then from this to compute
the poisoning. A code was set up to do these calculations on a computer.
The neutrpn'fluxes used were those reported in Ref. 15 and corrected with
more up to date information.'' Values of meny parameters used are given |
in Appendix A, and others were taken'fram standard reference manuals.
Nominal values of various important rate constants and other variables
were chosen, and the variation of poison fraction with these parameters
waS'computed; These nominal values may be interpreted as approximate
expected values. The first case to be discussed will be the.bubble7free
" situation. Then the case of circulating bubbles will be discussed.

In the bubble-free case the folloﬁing nominal values of various pa-

rameters were chosen:

all others being held constant at their nominal values. The circle in-
dicates the nominal value. From these plots the following observations
can be made. | | , (

of all variables plotted. Note particularly the insensitivity of poison-
ing to dvail&ble graphite void (Fig. 20)'and the diffusion cdefficient’

Of the 135Xe that migrates to the graphite, 52% is burned ﬁp and 48% de-
cays, averaged over the moderator region. Again, for the nominal case,
96.4% of the total poisoning is due to 135%e in the graphite and only
3.6% is due to the 135%e dissolved in the salt.

Estimated.135XeAPoisoning in the MSRE with Circulating Bubbles

 

" Xenon, and all noble gases for that matter, is extremely insoluble

in molten salt. From the Henry's law constant,
Cy = 2.08 x 107 ¢ at 1200°F ,

where the units of concentration are xenon atoms per unit volume. A sim-
ple calculation would show that with a circulating void fraction of 0.01
and the xenon in the liqﬁid.and gas‘phases in equilibrium, about 98% of
the xenon present would be in the bubbles, or if the void fraction is
0.001, 83% of the xenon would be in the bubbles. We would therefore ex-
pect that a small amount of circulating hellum bubbles would have a pro~
nounced effect on 135Xe polsoning.

Circulating bubbles have been observed in the MSRE. The most sig-
nificant indications come from "sudden pressure release tests.” These
experiments consist Qf slcwly.increasing the system pressure from 5 to

15 psig and then suddenly venting‘the'preSSUre off. Dﬁring'the pressure

release phase, the salt level in the pump bowl rises and the control rods

are withdrawn; both motions indicate that circulating bubbles are present.
Void fractions can be computed from these tests that range from 0 to 0.03
but are generally less than 0.01. The reactor operational parameters
that control the void fraction are not cempletely understood, and it ap-
pears to be a Quite complex phenemehon} fof instance, the void fraction
may be a function of how long the reactor has been opereting.

The bubble diameter is extremely difficult to estimate. The only

"direct source of information on this point is from a water loop used for

 
 

 

 

54

“i'?

MSRE pump—testing. In this‘lobp the pump bowl is simulated with Plexiglas
so that the water flow can be observed. The bubbles that migrated from
‘, the pump bowl into the pump suction could be seen and were about the size
of a "pinpoint." For lack of any better measuremeht they were taken to |
be in the order of 0.010 in. in diameter. As will be seen, this is not a
critical parameter in these calculations. o | |
~ Information in the literature on mass transfer to circulating bub-
‘bles is meager. Nevertheless, from Refs. 16 through 19 and other sources,
the mass transfer coefficient was estimated to be in the range 1 to 4
ft/hr and practically'indepehdent of diameter; Again it turns out that
this is not a critical.paraﬁeter, even over this fourfold range. It is
also assumed that the existence of circulating bubbles will haveiﬁo ef-
fect on the salt-to-graphite mass transfer coefficient. This is equiva-
" lent to saying that the circulating bubbles do not come in contact with
the graphite in any significant quantities. |
A parameter that is quite critical is the bubble stripping effi-
ciency., This is defined as the percentage of 135%e enriched bubbles that
burst in passing through the spray ring and are replaced with pure he-
lium bubbles.- At this time there.is no good indication as to what this
value is. It is probably a complex parameter like the circulating-void
fraction and depends on many reactor operational variables. For lack of
any better information, a nominal value was taken as 10%, because this
is about the salt stripping efficiency, but it could just as easily be
in the order of 100%. |

Again the nomina.lr value can be interpreted as the expected value but with

Figure 22 also shows the contribution of each system (salt, graph-
ite, andﬁbubbles)'to“the total 13°Xe poisoning. All parameters are fixed
at their nominal values. This figure illustrates how bubbles work to
lower the-poisoning.\ As the circulating void is increased, more and more
of the dissolved xenon migrates to the bubbles, as noted by the rapidly
increasing contribution to poisoning by the bubbles. In contrast to the
bubble-free case in which the 135%e in the graphite is the greatest con-
tribution to poisoning, the 135Xe concentration of the salt is rapidly
reduced by the'bubbles and is thus not available to the graphite.

At the time this report was written, there was no accurate knowledge
of the extent of 13°Xe poisoning. Preliminary values based on reactivity
balances indicate it is' in the range 0.3 to 0.4%: This ie considerably
below the value calculated for the bubble-free case, but it is well within
the expected range when circulating'helium bubbles are considered. We
conclude therefore that'this model probably does accurately portray the
physical reactor, and good agreement depends only on reliable values of
the variocus parameters involved. Work is currently under way to esti-
mate more aCCurately the circulating void fraction and to determine what
operational variables affect it. An attempt will also be made to esti-
mate the bubble stripping efficiency, although this may be quite an elu-
sive parameter to evaluate. Actually, the most recent information seems
to indicate that the circulating void fraction (V) is in the order of
0.1 to 0.3% and the bubble stripping efficiency (S/) is in the range of
50 te 100%. Equipment is currently being built to measure 135Xe poison

fractions more accurately.

CONCLUSIONS

The analyses presented indlcate the follow1ng

1. A transient experiment such as the B5Kr experlment can be useful\
in determining rate constants and other information for a complex process
such as noble gas dynamics in the MSRE. Thg:e are serious limitations,

however, and a detailed study should be made beforehand.

 
 

 

58

2. The krypton experiment indicated that mass transfer coefficients
- computed from heat-mass transfer analogies are quite good for the molten-
salt porous-graphlte systemn. ‘

3. If the MSRE could be operated bubble free, the computed 135Xe
poieoning would be 1.3 to 1.5% at 7.5 Mw. However, the reactor does not
operate bubble free, so the poisoning should be considerably less. This
results from the extreme insolubility of xenon in salt. When the model
is'modified to ineclude circulating bubbles, the computed values can be
made to agree with preliminary‘measured values (O-3—O.4%)_by adjusting
bubble parameters used over reasonablj'expected ranges. 1t would seem
therefore that the model does portray the physical reactor. waever,
to prove this conclusively, we must have accurate knowledge of the bub-
ble parameters, and with these calculate precisely the 135%e poisoning.
We think the model is quite representative of this‘system and can easily
be extended to other fluid-fueled feactors of this type. '

4. This model should not be taken as final. For instance, it wes
assumed that iodine does not volatilize. If it is later determined thet
iodine does'volatilize, the model will have to be_ adjusted accordingly.

. 5. The cifculating helium bubble concept should be considered se-
riously as a '35Xe removal mechanism in future molten-salt reactors. He-
lium bubbles could be injected into the flowing salt at the core outlet
and be removed with an in-line gas separator some distance downstream.

6. The insensitivity of 135Xe poisoning to the graphite void frac-
tion and diffusion coefficient should be noted. This indicates that the
tight specifications of these variables for the sole purpose of lowering
the *35%e poisoning might not be necessary. Considerable savings could .
be realized in\future reactors. This phenomenon occurred in the MSRE be-
cause the film coefficient is the controlling mechanism for transfer of
135%e to the graphite. Each future reactor concept would have to be
studied in detail to assure that this was still true before the above.

SALT-TO-GRAPHLITE COUPLING —

A question exists concerning the process of mass transfer from a
fluid to a porous medium as opposed to & continuous or homogeneous me-

dium. For example, the krypton flux from graphite to salt is given by

where A, is the total channel surface area of the graphite. The term
hﬁ is defined so that Cgf is not the krypton concentration in salt at

the salt-gas phase interface (located at a pore opening), but rather is
some continuous concentration across the entire surface of the graphite.
‘This is shown schematically below and would be similar for the case of

The mean pore -entrance diameter for CGB graphite is less than:0.1 M

and probably closer to 0.02 y, which is extremely small compared with the

boundary layer thickness. It seems .reasonable, therefore, that krypton
is transported from the pore opening to the continuous concentration layer
by a process of pure diffusion. Then from the'continuoﬁs layer to the
bulk salt, krypton will be transported by conventional fluid dynamic mass
transfer. Note that since salt will not wet graphite, and because of
the small pore size, the salt-gas interface wili certainly not penetrate
inside a pore. Also inherent in this analysis is the idea that salt will
touch the solid graphite matrix, even though it .will not wet it, and
therefore the salt-gas phase interfane will exist only at the pore open-
ing.' In order to couple the salt to.the graphite, it is necessary to
develop a relationship between c:ls‘f and cgi. ActuaXly it will be shown
that Cr, =~ CF,. ;

THEORETICAL MASS TRANSFER COEFFICIENTS

Theoretical mass transfer coefficients between fuel salt and graph-
ite may be estimated by using standard heat transfer coefficient relation-
ships and the analogy between heat and mass transfer.2°% These conversions
are brought about by‘sﬁbstitufion.of equivalent groups from the following
table into the apprOpriate heat transfer coefficient relationship. They

apply for either laminar or turbulent flow.
