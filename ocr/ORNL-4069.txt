DEVELOPMENT OF A MODEL FOR COMPUTING 135Xe
‘ MIGRATION IN THE MSRE

- R. J. Kedl A. Houtzeel

~ Abstract

The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) is a fluid-
‘fueled reactor with a potential as a thermal breeder. - Because
of the importance of neutron economy to the breeder concept, it
is necessary to know the dynamlcs of 135Xe in the circulating-
fuel system. 'There are several "sinks" where xenon may be de-
posited from the fuel, notably in the gas space of the pump
bowl and in the voids of the unclad graphite of the reactor
core. Since *25Xe in the core impairs the neutron economy, it
is important to understand the mass transfer mechanism involved
and the parameters that may be varied to control it.

‘This report deals prlmarlly with developing a model for
computing the migration of '2°Xe in the MSRE and with experi-
ments conducted to establish the model. A preoperational ex-
periment ‘was run in the MSRE with 85Ky tracer, and many of the
gas-transport constants were inferred from the results. Equiva-
lent transport constants for calculating the 135%e migraticn

-gave a poisoning of about 1. 4% without circulating bubbles and
. well below 1% with bubbles. Preliminary measurements made on
the critical reactor show xenon poisoning of 0.3 to O. 4% Since
physical measurements confirm that there are bubbles in the sys-
.. tem, the conclusion is drawn that the .computation model, the.
- krypton experiment, and reactor operation agree.

The goal of the Molten Salt Reactorwfrogram is to develop an effi-
01ent power- producing, thermal- breedlng reactor.‘ The Molten Salt Reactor
Experlment (MSRE) is one step toward that goal although it is not a
hreeder. Nuclear poisons, notably_1?5Xe, can detract 51gn1f1cantly from
the breedlng potentlal It was therefore considered appropriate to in-.
vestlgate in some detall the dynamlcs of" noble gases 1n thls pllot—plant—
scaled reactor and with this information to predlct quantltatlvely the
xenon p01son1ng.l

llhe 135Xe p01son1ng is a function of the steady-state 135Xe concen-
tratlon in the reactor core. It is computed by balan01ng the rates as-
soc1ated with the varlous source and sink terms 1nvolved. Since the MSRE

is fluid fueled xenon and iodine are generated directly in the salt and
the source term is essentially a constant. The sink terms, however, are
more complex. Xenon may be removed from the system via a stripping de-
vice, it can decay or be burned up in the salt, or it may be absorbed by;
the graphite and ultimately decay or burn up. Xenon may also be absorbed
by circulating helium bubbles, which complicate the model because of
their reiatively unknown dynamics. 7

This report is concerned principally with developing a model for
estimating the 135%e poisoning in the MSRE. waevef, the first part dis-
cusses an experiment, referred to as the krypton experiment, in which

some of the more elusive rate constants were evaluated.-

‘DESCRIPTION OF THE MSRE

The MSRE is a circulating-fluid-fueled graphite-moderated single-
region reactor. The fuel consists of uranium‘fluoride dissolved in a
mixture of lithium, beryllium, and zirconium fluorides. The normal oper-
" ating temperature is 1200°F, and the thermal power level is 7.5 Mw. The
reactor system consists of a primary loop containing the core and a sec-
ondary loop to remove the heat. Our cohcern is only with the primary
loop,>a schematic diagram. of which is shown.ianig. 1. Essentially it
consists of a pump, heat -exchanger, and reactor core. A detailed de-
scription of the MSRE is contained in Ref. 1, and pertinent design pa-
rameters are listed in Appendix A. | |

Figure 2 shows detalls 6f the fuel pump. If is rated for 1200 gpm
at a 48.5-ft head. fhe volute is cdmpletely enclosed in a vessel re-
ferred to as the pump bowl, which serves primarily as an expansion vol-
ume for the fuel salt. The overflow tank serves as an additional exXpan-
sion volume for the system and is fed by an overflow line that penétfates
up into the pump bowl. The normal operating helium pressure in the pump

bowl 1s 5 psig, which is also the pump suction pressure. There is a

continuous. flow of salt and helium through the pump bowl. The pfincipal'

salt flow is through the xenon stripper, which is a toroid containing

——

numerous small holes that spray salt through the helium atmosphere. The

salt flow is controlled with an orifice and has been calculated to be

‘It will be shown later that a very small quantity of” c1rculat1ng bubbles
has a very pronounced effect on xenon dynamlcs. Tn addition to the strip-
per.there’is salt flow of about 15 gpm from behind the impeller, through
a lahyrinth aleng the shaft, and into the pump bowl. The principal.helium
flow through the pump bowl is 2.4 std‘liters/min purge down the shaft to

‘ prevent ‘radioactive’ gases ‘and salt mist from reachlng the bearlng region

of the pump . There is an additional helium flow of 0.9 std llters/mln

toroid is stagnant gas. This stagnant kidney will be referréd_to,in the

contact with the fuel salt, and therefore ;35Xe may diffuse into its
porous structure; the graphite acts as a *?°Xe concentrator in the core.
The theoretical void percentage of MSRE graphitel(grade CGB) is 17.7%,
and slightly over half of it is accessible to. a gas such as xenon. ©
Other pertinent properties of this graphite are listed in-Appendix A,
and more detailed information is available in Refs. 3 and 4. The rate
at which 12%Xe diffuses to the graphite is a function of the salt-to-
graphite mass transfer coefficient, which is, in turn, a function of the

fuel-salt Reyndlds number.

The moderator region can be divided into three fluid dynamic regions "
of interest. First there is the bulk of the graphite (~95%), which is
characterized by salt velocities of about 0.7 ft/sec and a Reynolds num- ®

ber of about 1000. One would expect laminar flow; however, the entrance

to these channels is orificed and quite tortuous because of a layer of
graphite grid bars across the bottom of the moderator that are used to
space and support the core blocks. The effective mass £fahsfer coeffi-
cient is probably somewhere between the coefficients for laminar flow

and turbulent flow. The second fluid dymamic regién.is éompdsed of the
centermost channels in the core.(about 18). They do not have orificing
grid bars below them, so the fuel velocities are higher, about 1.8 ft/sec,
and give a Reynolds number of about 2500. Accordingly the mass transfer
coefficient is higher than for the bulk of the graphite and is for tur-
bulent flow. This region comprises about 1.5% of the graphite and is in
a zone of high nuclear importance. The third fluid dynamic'region is

the lowerhlayer of graphité'grid bars mentioned above, which do the ori-
ficing. These grid bars are subject to high salt velocities, a maximum
of about 5 ft/sec, and comprise a fluid dynamic entrance region. In ad-
diﬁion, the jéfs'forméd-by tﬁe grid bars impinge on the bottom of the
core blocks. The éntire région then is.- subject to much higher mass trans-
fer coefficients than the bulk graphite. This region is not.too well
defined but probably comprises about 3 5% of the total graphlte It is

1n a zone of very low nuclear 1mportance.

KRYPTON~85 EXPERIMENT

- Description of the Problem

_ Xenon-135 poisoning in the MSRE was considered prev1ously,5 7 but
these calculatlons were generally of an approximate design nature be-
cause of lack of 1nformatlon on the values of the rate constants 1n-
volved. In order to calculate the steady-state 135Xe poisoning in the
reactor, it was first necessary to compute. the }?5Xe_concentrat10n dis-
éolvéd in the salt. This was done by equating the various source and
sink rate terms involved and- solving for the .xenon concentration.. The
most significant_135Xe source term is that_whiqh comes from the decay

of .72°I; in addition a small amount is produced directly from fission.

The sink terms are discussed in some detail later, but we will initially
consider only the following terms and their associated rate constants:

Thé stripping efficiency of the pump bowl spray ring was méasured
at the University of Tennessee as part of a-masters degree thesis.®»?
This work was done with a CO,-water system maintained bubble free and
later confirmed with and O,-water system, also maintained bubble free.
A prototype of the xenon stripper was used in these tests. It was felt
desirable to check the results with a xenon and salt system, particularly
with circulating bubbles present. |
Xenon-135 burnup and decay rates are relatively well known. Migra-
tion of xenon to graphite is controlled by the mags transfer coefficient
and by the diffusion coeffiéient of xenon in graphite; The mass trans-
fer coefficient can be estimated from heat-mass transfer analogies (see
Appendix C), but the unknown mode of fluid flow (laminar or turbulent),
the unwettability of graphite by moltep salt, the question of mass trans-
fer to a porous surface rather than a continucus surface, and some natu-
ral resistance toward assuming a high degree of reliability for the heat-
mass transfer analogies made the estimated coefficients seem questionable.

The quantitative effect of circulating bubbles was almost completely

unknown, except that their effect would be prominent because of the ex-

tremely low solubility of xenon -in salt. In. addition there may be other

-effects not considered. Generally the state of knowledge of the rate

constants was considered somewhat wénting. Fach of these rate constants
could be investigated individually in the laboratory, but this would be
too expensive and time consuming. Rather, after other approaches were
considered, it was decided to conduct a single summary experiment on the
reactor and extract as many of the rate constants as possible, or at
least set limits on them. The experiment was referred to as the krypton

experiment.

Description of the Experiment

Essentially the experiment was divided into two phases and took place
during the precritical period of MSRE operations. The first phase was
an addition phase and consisted of‘adding 85Kr to one of the pump-bowl
level-indicator bubbler lines at a steady rate for a period of time. Dur-
ing this phase-the pump bowl reached some equilibrium 85Ky concentration

almost immediately; then the salt dissolved krypton via the xenon-strip-

per spray ring; and the graphite absorbed krypton from the salt. The

second phase began by turning off the krypton flow but maintaining all
bubbler and purge helium flows. Then the reverse processes took place.
The pump bowl-purged clean of krypton;'fhe salt was stripped; and finally
the graphite was leached. During the entire experiment the off-gas line
was monitored continuously with a radiation counter. By analyzing the
krypton concentration decay rate in the off-gas during the stripping
phase of the experiment, we evaluated éome of the rate constants in-
volved. The experiment had the advantage of evaluating the actual reac-
tor under operating conditiohs rather than models under simulated con-
ditions. The experiment had.thg limitation that several parameters had
to be e#aluated from essentially a single set of data and were therefore
subject to a certain amount.of personal interpretation. Also, transient
experiments are inherently more difficult to analyze than steady-state
experiments. Krypton-85 was'chosen for the experiment primarily for ease
of continuous monitoring‘ét low concentrations in the off-gas line; also

its low cost and availability were considerations.
10

~ Figure 5 is a schematic diagram of the krypton experiment facilities.
Basﬁcally, it consists of an addition station and a monitoring station.
The additioﬁ station controls the flow of an ®°Kr-He mixture into bubbler
line 593. The normal bubbler flow of ﬁure helium (0.37 std liters/min)
was maintained to transport the krypton-helium mixture into the pump bowl.
The reactor contains two bubblers. The second bubbler was used to per-
form its various reactor control functions. |

The krypton-helium container was made from 12-in. sched.-80 carbon
steel pipe and pipe caps and was about 5 ft long. It was hydrostatically
tes%ed at 520 psig. On one end was a U-tube and valve afrangement that
Was!used‘to transfer 85Kr from its shipping container to the experiment
container. The transfer was accomplished by first evacuating the experi- | | N
ment container and then opening the valve on the shipping container. This
resulted in about 95% transfer. The remaining krypton was transferred by

using the U-tube as a cold trap and freezing it with liquid nitrogen.

This two-step process resulted in the almost perfect transfer of the 120
curies of %%Kr purchased. The experiment container was then pressurized

to 180 psig with helium. After the first run it was further pressurized

‘with helium to 275 psig. Dilution was necessary in order to have enough

gas to measure and control adequately. The-original. 120 curies of 85Ky

amounted to only about two“liters, and this had to be added continuously

to:the.reactor for a period of several days. |
Based on expefience of the personnel in the Isotopes Division of

ORNL, krypton mixed with helium will tend to settle out over a period

of time. To counter this effect the krypton-helium contéiner was equipped

with a hermetically sealed agitator. It consisted of an 8-in. aluminum

‘ball inside the tank that rolled back and forth as the tank was rocked.

A large coil of 1/4-in. stainless steel tubing was located between the
krypton-helium container and flow control equipment to compensate for
the rocking motion. The limiting flow valve was set to limit the flow
from the container to about 20 std liters/hr'in case of a complete rup-
ture downstream. - The remainder of the flow control system consisted of
conventional filters‘(5 to 9 u), pressure gages, and low-capacity valves.
The flowmeter was a Hanover matrix type and was calibrated for various
outlet pressures.

As shown in Fig. 5, all the reactor off-gas from the pump bowl went
through the monitoring station. It could pass through either one of two
identical monitors or a bypass line. The monitors were labeled A and B.
Monitor B was used for all runs. Monitor A was intended as a spare but
was never needed. Théy were designed for a range of five decades of ac-

tivity. ZEach consisted of four amperex 90NB GM tubes, which were shielded

as follows:

. GM Tube

~100 mg/cm? plastlc window (7.62 X 2. 54 cm)
in 5.9 g/cm brass container

4 5.9 g/cm brass container
12

The four GM tubes were suspended in a 2-liter stainless steel labo-
ratory beaker. The monitors were calibrated with small samples of 8 5kr.
During the first run.of the experiment, it was found that the plastic
shielding on GM tube No. 2 absorbed 85kr and gave a false count rate;
also it affected other tubes in the array. . To correct for this, the plas-
tic waé removed and GM tube No. 2 became identical with tube No. 1. The
GM output was fed into a decade scaler and a count rate meter; The de-
cade scaler was used for recording data, and the count rate meter was |
used for éxperiment control assistance.

Much consideration was given to the safety aspect of handling 120
curies of 85Kr. The half-life of 8%Kr is 10.3 y and it gives off 0.695-
and 0.15-Mev beta particles and a 0.54-Mev gamma ray. The daughter prod- l

L)

uct is 85Rb, which is stable. The area in which the experiment was con-
ducted was equipped with radiation detectors énd air monitors. A con-
tinuous flow of air (17,000 to 20,000 cfm) was maintained through the re-
actor building and released to the atmosphere through a 100-ft stack.
Bricks were stacked around the krypton-helium tank, and the activity level
outside the bficks was negligible. Special beta-sensitive monitor badges
were worn by personnel operating the experiment. Detailed procedures for
transferring 8?Kr, pressurizing the container, and conduéting the addition
and stripping phases of the experiment were written and approved by ap-

propriate personnel.

Procedure and Description of Runs

The procedure used to start the addition phase was to adjust the

krypton-helium container regulator so that the pressure gage just up-

O

- stream of the main flow control valve was about 10 psig, that is, about

5 psi over the pump bowl pressure. The flow rate was then controlled , .
with the main flow control valve. During the addition phase the system

was checked every 1/2 to 1 hr, and the flow control was adjusted as nec-

essary to maintain a constant activity in the off-gas line. The krypton-

helium container was agitated for about 15 min every 2 to 4 hr. .For

various runs. the krypton-helium injection rate ranged from 2 to 6.3 std

liters/hr but was held constant for each run.
)

13

'Zero time in the procedure was defined as the time when the krypton-
helium flow was turned off. This was accomplished by closing the krypton-
off valve and then the regulafing valve. It‘took a minute or so before
the monitor started droppihg because all the lines had to be purged. At
the start of the stripping phase, a l-min count was taken every 1 1/2 min.
The times gradually increased until at the end of the long runs (2 and
3) a l/2—hr count was taken every hour. Note from Figs. 1 and 2 that
there are two essentially stagnant lines entering'the pump bowl, the sam-
pler-enricher line and the overflow line. These lines were purged free
of 87Kr before the stripping phase started and at various times during
the stripping operation. |

Six 8%Kr addition and stripping runs were made. Table 1 summarizes
the operational parameters in these runs. Figures 6 through 11 show the
results of these runs. The count rate in the off-gas.monitor is plotted
against time during the stripping phase and has been corrected for dead
time of the GM tubes. Nb correction was necessary for the decay of 8 5Ky
because its half-life is so long compared with the time scale of eéﬁh
run. As pointed out previously, the data from run 1 are erroneous be-
cause of 8°Kr absorbed.on the plastic shielding a GM tube 2. This plas-
tic was removed for subsequent runs. Nevertheless, as an added check,
the monitors were purged periodically with pure helium, and a background
count was measured. In all cases after run 1 the background count for
tubes 3 and 4 was less than 15 cpm.

Objectives associated with each run were the following:

ANAIYSIS OF THE &°Kr EXPERIMENT

General Approach

Analysis of the 8°Kr experiment is concerned with the stripping

phase of the runs. The principal stripping processes involved, in order

of occurrence, are purging the pump bowl, stripping the salt and asso-
ciated circulating bubbles (if present), and then leaching the graphite.

Other leaching processes of no fundamental interest but of importance

because they contribute to the measured flux decay curve are diffusion

out of the stagnant bubbler kidney described earlier and leaching 8 5y
that may have been trapped in gas pockets located in the primary loop.
Locations of potential gas pockets in the loop are in the freeze flanges,

graphite access port,.and the spaces formed by the assembly of the core

blocks. - There are various bits of evidence that pockets actually exist,
although their location and capacity are not certain..

.The fuel salt circuit time around the loop is 25 sec, which is short
compared with-the time scale of the stripping process involved, so the
fuel loop can be considered as a well-stirred pot. At any Specific time
therefore,-the-kryptbn concentration is considered to be constant through-
out- the loop.‘ In the simplest case, it can be shown that each transient

stripping process, when unaffected by any other stripping process, will

.obey an exponential decay law; that is at time t,

—Qt

Kr flux, = Kr flux_ e :

t

In the actual case, however, each stripping process will affect every
other stripping process to a greater or iessér extent. Note that pump
bowl purging, salt stripbing, and graphite leaching are series processes;
that is, they occur in the sequence given; while leachings of the several
graphite regions are barallel processes; that is, they occur simulta-

neously after the krypton concentration in the salt starts to drop. Quali-

" tatively, the measured decay curve would be expected to be the sum of the

contributions of each leaching process, as shown in Fig. 12. Note that

the count rate in the off-gas line is plotted on the ordinate and is a
unit of concentration; however, since the off-gas 1is fiowing at a con-
stant rate, it also represents the 85Ky flux leaving the reactor. Each
of the component curves should approach an exponential decay after the
initial transient.

Now the problem is to separéte,these individuql processes from the
measured flux turve, with the realization that there may be dther leach-
ing processes not accounted for. It should be pointed out again that
the breaking down of a single composite data curve into several individual
processes and the determination of rate constants for each is quite com-
Plex and necessarily subject to a certain amount of personal interpreta-
tion.-

Two approaches were used in analyziﬁg the data. The most success-
ful method consisted of an exponential peeling technique, as shown quali-
tatively in Fig. 13 for run 3. The assumption is made that the tail of
the decay curve is determined completely by leaching the slow (bulk) rate
constant graphite. The procedure was fhen to determine the equation for
the slowest exponential that fit asymptotically on the curve and subtract
it from the data. ‘The next exponential equation that fit asymptotically

on the rémaining data was then determined and again subtracted. This

‘procedure was repeated to a logical conclusion; that is, until continued

subtracting from the data gave negligible values. This procedure for

run 3 resulted in five exponentials, which is somewhat significant be-
cause of the five major stripping operations (pump bowl, salt, including
bubbles, and three graphite regions). This general approach;is in error
in that it assumes that each strippiﬁg process starts at zero time and
proceeds independently at all others. It will be geeﬁ, however, that this
approach is adequate for both the vefy slowest rate constant processes

(leaching bulk graphite) and the very fastest rate constant processes

(purging pump bowl), but it is inadequate for intermediate procesées

(stripping salt and faster rate constant graphite). Figure 14 shows the

results of this exponential peeling process on run 3. The rate constants

"are a function only of the slopes of fhe exponentials involved, so abso-

lute calibrations of the monitor and detailed knoﬁledge of the &%Kr con-

centrations are not necessary. Numerical results of peeling run 3 and

‘their'intefpretation are given in Table 2. This approach to analyzing

the data was the principal method used. It is of necessity confined to .
the fastest and slowest rate processeé involved. But when applied to
these processes,‘the results have a high degree of reliability, as will
be seen.

A second method of analysis of the data was undertaken primarily as
an attémpt to determine rate constants for the intermediate processés in-
volved, such as stripping efficiency and mass transfer to the faster rate
constant graphite regions. In this approach, unsteady-state differential
equations were set up around the pump powl gas phase, fuel salt, and
three graphite regions. The resulting five equations could be solved
simultaneously for the rate constants involved. 'Physically this was done
with a computer, and the rate constants were solved for by the method of
steepest ascent. The approach was not too successfﬁl,_probably for the
following reasons: , '

1. There were actually more than five 8°Kr sources in the system,
so the mathematipal'model.Was bverly simplified. Primarily the,effects

of circulating bubbles were not adequately accounted for.

In the first term Cz is the mean ®°Kr concentration in the gas phase of
the pump bowl and the product Ec: is the concentration in the off-gas
line; therefore, E can be thought of as a mixing efficiency. The second
term represents the rate at which krypton is stripped from the salt,
where S is the stripping efficiency. The third term is the rate at which
krypton is stripped from the circulating bubbles, where | is the void
fraction and S’/ is the bubble stripping efficieﬁcy.

If these three terms are evalﬁated at the beginning of the stripping
phase, the second term is approximately 1/500 of the first term, so it
can be neglected. The third term is about 1/20 or less of the first term
for expected values of ¥ and S/. It must be neglected because of inade-
quate knowledge of ¢ and S’/. The error introduced, however, will not be
great. The above equation also neglects the 85Kr contribution by the

that this is also an adequate assumption.

Xenon Stripper Efficiency

As pointed out previously, values for the stripping efficiency could
not be extracted from the data with any degree of accuracy, even though
runs 4, 5, and 6 were performed with this goal in mind. Very rough cal--
culations do indicate that the stripping efficiencies are moré or less
consistent with those.measured at the University of Tennessee in a COjz-

- water system, but the calculations are so approximate and dependent on

hazy assumptions that they will not be presented here.

Mass Transfer to Graphite

-

- To review briefly the graphite regions, recall that three regions

were identified from fluid dynamic considerations. First there is the
30

bulk graphite region (~95%) that is characterized by salt velocities of
about 0.7 ft/sec and a Réynolds number of about 1000. The mass transfer.
coefficient will be between that for laminar and that for turbulent floﬁ.
Second, there is the graphite associated with the centermost fuel chan-
nels, which comprises about 1.5% of the graphite. The fuel velocity and
the mass transfer coefficient in this region will be higher than in the
bulk graphite region. Third, there is a region of structural graphite
across the battom of the core. It is difficult to determine the exact
boundary of this region, but it probably consists of approximately 3.5%
of the graphite and is in a zone of low nuclear importance. It is char-
acterized by orificing effects, impingement of salt, and fluid dynamic
entrance regions; therefore it will ha&e the highest mass transfer coef-
ficients. : ' ‘ _ g
‘The first question td be resolved concerns salt-to-graphite coupling
via the mass transfer coefficient. The krypton flux from the' graphite

can .be expressed as |

Kr flux from graphite = hIiAG(Clgi - Cl;) 5

where Cgi is conventionally defined as the krypton concentration in the
salt and at the interface, where the interface is continuous. In this
case the salt-gas interfgce is inside a pore that occupies only a small
fraction of the total graphite surface area. Therefore we neéd a rela-
tionship between this concentration at the pore interface and the more
conventional CEi' This is discussed in Appendix B, where it is shown
that the mean concentration of krypton in a continuous salt film across
the graphite surface is épproximately equal to the krypton concentration
in the salt at the salt-gas interface inside a graphite pore.

The rate at which €°Kr is ieached from the graphite is a function
of several parameters; for instance, the diffusivity of krypton in graph-
ite, the mass transfer coefficient, and the 85Kr concentration dissolved
in the bulk sait, which is in turn a function of the xenon stripper effi-
ciency. The general approach in the graphite analysis will be to first
show that this rate is very insensitive to expected values of the dif-

fusion coefficient of krypton in graphite. This being true, we can

e
31

determine a relationship between the mass. transfer coefficient and the
stripping efficiency, any combination of which will result in a flux curve
as meesured. Theﬁ by weighting this.relationship'with’the value of strip-
ping.efficiency measured at the University of Tennessee, theoretical
velues for the mass transfer coefficient (see Appendix C), and other con-
siderations, we will obtain a very narrow range of‘possible values for

the mass transfer coefficient. Generally, this procedure will be fol-
lowed for all the graphite regions considered. Most of the calculations
wili be confined to run 3, which was concerned primarily with measuring
graphite rate constants.

Consider the ®°Kr flux from graphite as a function only of its in—
ternal resistance (Dg) and its external resistance (pi). Also specify
that, for times equal to or greater than zero, the krypton concentration
dissolved in the fuel salt is zero. Cylindrical geometry is used; that
is, each core block is considered to be a cylinder, the surface area of
which is eqﬁal £b the fuel ehannel area aseociated with a single core
block. The volume'of a graphite cylinder ef this sort is very close to
the volume of the actual core blocks of the same length. The differen-

tial equation that describes this case is

From this équation it can be seen that the krypton flux from any
given graphite region is the sum of a series of exponentials, with the
slope of each exponential being determined by the exponent of e. The

problem now is one of relating these exponents to the slopes of the peeled
- 33

flux curves. Considering run 3 it is obvious that the slowest exponent
(t1/2 = 198 hr) is related to the bulk graphite, and it is expected that
the next exponential (ti1,2 = 15.5 hr) is related to the graphite region
located at the center line'of_the‘cofe. The next exponential (ti,z = 4.52
hr) has a fairly low order of confidence in equating it to any specific
graphite region and will not be considered. It can be shown that for
each of the two graphite regions considered, only the first térm of the
above series is significant. Thérefore the exponent of e can be related

to the measured half-life, as follows:

-

Now, by evaluating this equation in conjunction with the eigenfunction

equation, we can relate values .of hm and Dk This was. done with the fol-

lowing paramgter values, and the results agpear in Fig. 17: -
t1/, (bulk graphite) = 198 hr (run 3),

¢ = 0.10, " -
r, = 0.0905 ft, )
H = 8.5 X 107% moles/cc-atm,
HRT = 6.43 X 107%.

The ordinate represents the range in which»Dg is expected to lie. Note
that for bulk graphite the value of hi is almost completely independent
of Dé; therefore the mass transfer coefficient is controlling the krypton
flux from this graphite region. For the center-line graphite region,

the dependence of flux on Dg

It is difficult to extract hi information from run 2 because the
time intervals involved were too short. The krypton addition and strip-
ping phases were about 60 hr each..'During this relatively short addition
time the bulk graphite reached only about 20% of its saturated value, in
contrast to run 3, where it reached about 70% of its saturated value.

was almost completely saturated. After stripping for 60 hr in run 2, the
slope of ﬁhe flux curve is not determined by a single graphite region
but is still under the influence of two graphite regions, and it cannot
be peeled by the same technique as run 3. Nevertheless, run 2 was looked
at, and without presenting any results, it will be stated that it was
consistent with run 3.

Now, since hm is not a strong‘function of Dg, we can determine the
relationship between hﬁ and S (stripping efficiency). This will be done
for the bulk graphite region after sufficient time so that other tran-

sients are negligible. First, we will make the following rate balance:

Kr flux from xenon stripper = Kr flux from graphite
+ dilution rate of Kr in salt,

where

laminar and turbulent flow; it displays the uncertainty in the diffusivity
of krypton in salt. In addition the expected range of stripping effi-
ciehcy is outlined. Note that the calculated curves fall within the ex-
pected range. _ |

In order to pick out more explicit values of th, we can weight this
curve with the following two cons1deratlons. First, it is expected that
some 01rculat1ng bubbles were present as will be shown in the next sec-
tion on Capacity Considerations. Furthermore, it is expected that cir-

- culating bubbles increase the effective stripping efficiency to the high
end-of the indicated range, and'likely even higher. Second, most of the
salt:iu the bulk graphite region is of a laminarrcharaoter, rather than
turbulent, so h;? ought to be on the lower end of the‘expected range;
Therefore, from Fig. 18 and with the above weighting considerations, we
might pick out a probable range of hﬁ?'to bulk graphite as

0.05 < K < 0.09 £t /hr .

The next graphite region (tl/é = 15.5 hr), interpreted as the center-
line graphite region, is more difficult to handle. The previous deriva-
tion assumes that all the krypton dissolved in salt comes from the graph-
ite region under consideration. Now, when working with the center-line
‘region, we must also consider the krypton dissolved in salt that origi-
nates in the buik graphite. "An equation whose derivation is similar to

the above and which partially compensates for tlis is

Fluxg = 3574 counts/min (intercept of peeled curve at t = O fer

bulk graphite),
FluxgL = 2178 counts/min (intercept of peeled curve at t = O for

bulk graphite).

Th% results of this caig;latiop appear on Fig. 18. Also shown is the |
theoretical range of hm based on turbulent flow and displaying the un-
certainty in diffusivity of krypton in salt. The equation for hkCL is
1nvalld at low values of S because kkB approaches 1nf1n1ty, hence the
llnes are terminated as they approach the equivalent line for th Nev-
er?heless, 1t seems that a reasonable range of hkCL for the MSRE would

be between 0.25 and 0.4 ft/hr.

Capacity Considerations

In addition to rate constant determinations from slopes of the peeled
exponentials, we should be able to infegrate under the curves and deter-
mine information on the capacity of the system. For instance, the inte-
gral of the bulk graphite curve (t1/2 = 198 hr) should yield.the approxi-
mate &Kr capacity of this graphite.. Then, from knowledge of the 8 5kr
addition concentration, we could compute the‘approximate graphite void
fraction available to krypton. When this calculation was performed with
the.additioh concentration taken as the mean pump bowl concentration, _
the graphite void fraction came out to be about 0.40. This is obviously
incorrect, even when' the rough nature of the calculation is considered.
The reason for this is that kryp%on was added through a bubbler,'and it
bubbled up through the salt at approximately one order of magnitude higher
in concentration than in the pump bowl proper. These highly concentrated
krypton bubbles were caught in the turbulent and recirculating zone formed
by the spray ring. Very likely some of these bubbles, or micro bubbles,
were carfied into the primary looﬁ and circulated with the salt. The re-

sult was that the concentration of dissolved krypton in the fuel salt was .

41

much higher than it would have been based.on the mean pum@ bowl concen-
tfation. Now, if we compute the graphite void fraction based on the dis-
solved krypton in the salt being in equilibrium with the bubbler addi-
tion stream, the result is about 0.04, and this is lower than would be
expected. The true void fraction is between the limits of what can be
calculated, and insufficient information is available to compute it more
accurately. The same‘is true for all other graphite regions and the fuel
salt, therefore little useful  information on capacity 1is available from
the data. It should be pointed out that the choice of a bubbler line

for 85K; addition as opposed to the pressure reference leg, which’would
not have given this deleterious effect, was dictated by other consider-

ations. -

XENON-135 POISONING IN THE MSRE

General Discussion

To calculate the'steady—staté'l35Xe poisoning in the MSRE, it is
first necessary to compute the steady-state 135%e concentration dissolved
in the salt. This is because the ?%Xe is generated exclusively in the
salt, at least it is assumed to be. The.xenon concentration in the salt
is computed by equating the éourCe and- sink rate terms involved. The
most significanf of these terms and considerations involving them are

discussed below.

Dissolved Xenon Source Terms and Considerations

1. Xenon Direct from Fission. The 135%e generation rate direct

from fission is about 0.3% per\ﬁissibn.

2. Xenon from Todine Decay. The *3°I generation rate is 6.1% per
135
) Te-

fission, either direct or from the decay of It in turn decays to
135¥e with & 6.68-hr half-life. The total ?°Xe generation rate is there-
fore 6.1 + 0.3 = 6.4% per fission, and, as will be seen from the next
consideration, is confined completely to the salt phase. Since the prin-

éipal 135%e source is from the decay of iodine and since the 1351 nalf-
42

life is long compared with the fuel-loop cycle time (25 sec), it will be
assumed that 135Xe is generated homogeneously throughout the fuel loop.

‘3. Iodine and Tellurium Behavior. Since '2°I and '35Te are pre-

cursors of 3%Xe, their chemistry is important. In this model it is as-
sumed that both elements femain in solution as ions, and therefore will
‘not be removed from solution by the xenon stripper or diffusion into the
grabhite. Concerning iodine, its thermodynamic properties indicate this

10 Recent evidence from the reactor also indicates this to

to be true.
be true. Some iodine has been found in thé off-gas system (but very lit-
tle, if any,_1351), but this is due to the volatilization of the precur-
sor tellurium. Since 135Te has such a short half-life (<0.5 min), very
little of it will have a chance to volatilize; therefore this effect is
neglected. It is also assumed for this model that iodine and tellurium
will not be absorbed on any internal reactor surfaces, such as the con-

tainment metal and graphite.

Dissolved Xenon Sink Terms and Considerations

1. Xenon De¢ay. Xenon-135 decays with a half-life of 9.15 hr, and

decay takes place throughout the entire fuel loop.

2. Xenon Burnup. Xenon-135 has a neutron absorption cross section
11

of 1.18 X 10° barns averaged over the MSRE neutron spectrum.

3. ZXenon Stripper Efficiency. As noted earlier, the efficiency of

the xenon stripper was measured at the University of Tennessee with a
COs-water systemg and confirmed later with an Oj-water system.12 Both
tests were for a bubble-free system. The measured rate constants were

then extrapolated to a xenon-salt system.?

The stripping efficiency is
defined as the percent of dissolved gas transferred’from the salt to the
gas phase in passing through the xenon stripper spray system. In magni-
tude it turns out to be between 8 and 15%.

4. Xenon Adsorption. Xenon is not adsorbed on graphite signifi-

cantly at these temperatures, 3,14 and it is very wnlikely that it will
be adsorbed on metal surfaces. '

5. Xenon Migration to Graphite. The amount of xenon transferred

to the graphite is a function of the mass transfer coefficient, diffusion

coefficieht of xénon in graphite, and the burnup and decay rate on the
43

graphite. During manufacture, this graphité was impregnated éeveral times
to obtain a low permeability. Diffusion experim.ents2 with a - single sam-
ple of CGB graphite yielded a diffusion coefficient of xenon in helium

at 1200°F and 20 psig of about 2.4 X 1075 cm?/sec (9.2 x 10-5 £t2/hr).
This was measured in a single sample of graphite and may not be repre- |
sentative of fhe reactor core; however, it will be seen later that the
poison fraction in the MSRE is not é strong function of the diffusivity.
As previously pointed out, the core grgphite_may.be divided into three
fluid dynamic regions, bulk,.center line, and lower grid. The krypton
experiment did not yield any reliable information on the lower-grid re-
gion, and since it is in a region of very low nuclear importance, it will
not be considered. The bulk and center-line regions will, however,_be
considered. ' |

6. Xenon Migration to Circulating Bubbles. As will be seen, the

effect of circulating bubbles is very significant because Xenon is so
insoluble in salt. Although information on circulating bubbles is meager,

they will be considered..

Other Assumptions and Considerations

7

1. The '3°Xe concentration dissolved in the fuel salt was assumed
to be constant throughout the fuel loop. From the éomputed results it .
can be shown to change less than 1%.
2. Tt was assumed that the 12°Xe isotope behaves independently of
all other xenon isotopes present.
" 3. The 13%%e generated in the laminar sublayer of salt next to the”
~ graphite was considered as originating in the bulk salt.

4, The core was considered as being composed of 72 annular rings,

44,
Average values of parameters such as neutron flux, percent graphite, mass
Itransfer coefficient, etc., were used for each ring. :
5. The reactor system was assumed to the isothermal at 1200°F.
Consistent with all previous assumptions, the rate balance of 13°Xe

dissolved in the fuel salt at steady state is the following:

Generation rate = Decay rate in salt + burnup rate in salt
+ stripping rate + migration'rate to graphite

+ migration rate to circulating bubbles P

where the units of each térm‘are ;35Xe atoms per unit time. ZFach term

will now be considered Separately.

Xenon-135 Generation Rate

The total 13%Xe yield is 644% per fission. The'cérresponding 135xe

generation rate is 5.44 x 10'° 1?Xe atoms per hour at 7.5 Mw.

Strlpplng‘rate = Q,SPSCS .

Xenon-135 Migration to Graphite

Each graphite core block will be assumed to be éylindrical. This
seems to be a good compromise between the true case and ease of computa-
tioh. The surface-to-volume ratio for a cylinder is very close to the
channel surface area-to-volume ratio of the actual core blocks. Diffu-
sion of 1?°Xe inside cylindrical éore blocks at-steady state and with a

sink term is as follows:

Xenon-135 Migraﬁion Rate to Circulating Bubbles

The rate of *35Xe migration to the circulating bubbles is represented

by
Migration rate to bubbles = h A (c: - c¥,

in units of '35Xe atoms per hour. The salt film is by far the control-
ling resistance; therefore the 135%e concentration in the bubble is uni-
form and at equilibrium with the concentration in the salt at the inter-

face. Consequently the previous equation can be written as

[
f

Migration rate to bubbles = hpA_ @: - HRTC%) :

At steady state the migration rate to the bubbles equals the rate

that_135Xe is removed from the bubbles, therefore

and the burnup rate of '2°Xe in the bubbles is handled the same as in the
salt, that is, by dividing the core into 72 elements of volume and adding
up the burnup in each element. Substituting the individual rate terms in

Xenon-135 Poisoning Calculations

Estimated '3°Xe Poisoning in the MSRE Without Circulating Bubbles

With the equations given above, 135%e poisoning has been computed
for the MSRE for a variety of conditions subject to the assumptions dis-

~cussed earlier. The procedure was to first solve for the steady-state
50

1é’!s}(e concentration dissolved in the salt, and then from this to compute
the poisoning. A code was.set up to do these calculations on a computer.
Thé neutron fluxes used were those reported in Ref. 15 and corrécted with
more up to date information.'! Values of many parameters used are given
in Appendix A, and others were taken from standard reference manuals.
Nominal values of various important rate constants and other variables
were chosen, and the variation of polson fraction with these parameters
was computed. These nominal values may be interpreted as approximate
expected values. The first case to be discussed will be the bubble-free
situation. Then the case of circulating bubbles will be discussed.

In the bubble-free case the following nominal values éf various pa-

rameters were chosen:

Available void fraction in graphite, € 0.10
Diffusion coefficient of Xe in graphite, 1 x 1074
DE, ft3 of void per hr per ft of graphite

Mass transfer coefficient to bulk graph- 0.0600
ite, hXB, ft/hr

Mass transfer coefficient to center-line 0.380
graphite, hﬁgL, ft/hr

Stripping efficiency of spray ring, S, % 12

Reactor thermal power level, Mw 75

The pump bowl mixing efficiency was found to have a negligible effect and
was not considered. A

The results of the calculation are given in Figs. 19 and 20. Each
plot shows the poisoning as a function of the parameter indicated, with
all others being held constant at their nominal values. The circle in-
dicates the nominal value. From these plots the following observations
can be made. _ — ,

1. For the bubble-free case, the 1?5Xe poisoning in the MSRE should
be 1.3 to 1.5%.

2. Generally speaking the poisoning is a rather shallow function
of all variabies plotted. DNote particularly the insensitivity of poison-
ing to available graphite void (Fig. 20) and the diffusion coefficient
(Fig. 20). The reason is that hz'controls the '?°Xe flux to the graph-

ite. This could be an important economic consideration in future reactors

Of the 135Xe that migrates to the graphite, 52% is bufned up and 48% de-
cays, averaged ovef the moderator region. Again, for the nominal case,
96.4% of the total poisoning is due to *?%Xe in the graphite and only
3.6% is due to the "?°Xe dissolved in the salt.

Estimated 12%Xe Poisoning in the MSRE with Circulating Bubbles

Xenon, and all noble_gases_for that matter, is extremely insolﬁble

in molten salt. From the Henry's law constant,

2

c§ = 2.08 X 10~ cz at 1200°F

where the units of concéntration'are xenon atoms per unit volume. A sim-
ple calculation would show that with a circulating void fraction of 0.01
and the xenon in the liqﬁid and gas phasesvin equilibrium, about 98% of
the xenon present would be in the bubbles, or.if the void fraction is

- 0.001, 83% of the xenon would be in the bubbles. We would therefore ex-
pect that a small amount of circulating heliﬁm bubbles would have a pro-
nounced effect on *?°Xe poisoning.

Circulating bubbles have been observed in the MSRE. The most sig?
nificant indications come from "sudden pressure release tests." These
experiments consist of slowly increasinglthe system pressure from 5 to
15 psig'and then suddenly ventiné“the pressure off. During the pressure
release phase, the salt level in the pump bowl rises and the éontrol rods
are withdrawn; both motions indicate that circulating bubbles are present.
Void fractions can be computed from these tests that range from C to 0.03 |
but are generally less than 0.0l. The reactor operational parameters
thaﬁ controi the void fraction are not completely understood, and it ap-
pears fo be a quite complex phenomenon. For instance, the void fraction
may be a function of how long the reactor has been operating.

The bubble diameter is extremely difficult to estimate. The only

direct source of information on this point is from a water loop used for
54

MSRE pump testing. In this loop the pump bowl is simulated with Plexiglas
so that the water flow can be observed. The bubbles that migrated from
the pump bowl into the pump suction could be seen and were about the size
of a "pinpoint." For lack of any better measurement they were taken to
be in the order of 0.010 in. in diameter. As will be seén, this is not a
critical parameter in these calculations.

Information in the literature on mass transfer to circulating bub-
bles -is meager. Nevertheiess, from Refs. 16 through 19 and other sources,
the.mass transfer coefficient was estimated to be in the range 1 to 4
ft/hr and practically independent of diameter. Again it turns out that
this is not a crifical,paraMeter, even over this fourfold range. It is
also assumed that the existence of circulating bubbles will have no ef-
fect on the salt-to-graphite mass transfer coefficient. This is equiva-
lent to saying that the circulating bubbles do not come in contact with
the graphite in any significant quantities.

A parameter thaf is quite critical is the bubble stripping effi-
clency. This is defined as the.-percentage of 135%e enriched bubbles that
burst in passing through the spray ring and are replaced with pure he-
lium bubbles. At this time there is no good indication as to what this
falue is. It is probably a complex parameter like the circulating-void
fraction and depends on many reactor opefational variables. For lack of
any better information, a nominal value was taken as 10%, because this
is about the salt stripping efficienc&,.but it could just as easily be
in the order of 100%. 4

held constant at their nominal values. From these figures, the following
observations can be made: |

1. Circulating bubbles have a very pronounced effect on 3°Xe poi-
soning, even at very low void percentages.

2. The '3%Xe poisoning is a rather weak function of the bubble mass
transfer coefficient and diameter over the expected range.

3. The poisoning is a strong function of the bubble stripping effi-

ciency.

[}

Figure 22 also shows the contribution of each system (salt, graph-
ite, and bubbles) to the total 135Xe.poisoning. All parameters.are fixed
at their nominal values. This figure illustrates how bubbles'work to
lower the poisoning. - As the circulating void is increased, more and more
of the dissolved xenon migrates to the bubbles, as noted by the fapidly
increasing contribution to poisoning by the bubbles. In contrast to the
bubble-free case in which the *2°Xe in the graphite is the greatest con-
tribution to poisoning, the 135%¢ concentration of the salt is rapidly-
reduced by the bubbles and is thus not available to the'grapﬁite.

At the time this report was written, there was no accurate knowledge
of the extent of 2Xe poisoning. Preliminary values based on reactivity
balances indicate it is in the range 0.3 to 0.4%. This is considerably
below the value calculated for the bubble-free case, but it is well within
the expected range when circulating helium bubbles are considered. We
conclude therefore that this model probably does accurately portray the
physical reactor, and good agreement depends only on reliable values of
the various parameters involved. Work is currently under way to esti-
mate more accurately the circulating void fraction and to determine what
operational variables affect it. An attempt will also be made to esti~
mate the bubble stripping efficiency, although this may be quite an elu-
sive parametér to evaluate. Actually, the most recent information seemsk
to indicate that the circulating void fraction (V) is in the order of
0.1 to 0.3% and the bubble stripping efficiency (S/).is in the range of
50 to 100%. Equipment is currently being built to measure 135%e poison

fractions more accurately.

CONCLUSIONS

The analyses presented indicate the follOW1ng

1. A transient experlment such as the ®°Kr experiment can be useful
in determining rate constants and other 1nformat10n for a complex process
such as noble gas dynamics in the MSRE. There are serious limitations,

however, and a detailed study should be made beforehand.
58

2. The krypfon'experiment indicated that mass transfer coefficients
computed from heat-mass transfer analogies are quite good for tﬁe molten-
salt poroungraphite system. :

3., If the MSRE could be operated bubble free, the computed 135%e
poisoning would be 1.3 to 1.5% at 7.5 Mw. However, the reactor does not
operate bubble free, so the poisoning should be considerably less. This
results from the extreme insolubility of xenon in salt. When the model
is modified to include circulating bubbles, the compﬁted values can be
made to agree with preliminary measured values (0.3-0.4%) by adjusting
bubble parameters used over reasonably expected ranges. It would seem
therefore that the model does portray the physical ‘reactor. However,
to prove this conclusively, we must have accurateAknowledge of thé bub-
ble parameters, and with these calculate precisely the l?SXe poisoning.
We think.thé model is quite representative of this system and can easily
be extended to_éther fluid-fueled reaétors of this type.

4. This model should not be taken as final. For instance, it was
assumed that iodine does not volatilize. If it is later determined that
iodine does volatilizé, the model will have to be adjusted accordingly.

s, The'circulating helium bubble concept should be considered se-
riously as a 135%e removal mechanism in future molten-salt reactors. He-
lium bubbles could be injected into the flowing salt at the core outlet
and be removed with an in-line gas.separator some distance downstream.

6. Thé_insensitivity of 135%e poisoning to the graphite void frac-
‘tion and diffusion coefficient should be noted. This indicates that the
tight specifications of these Variables for the sole purpose of lowering
the 135%e poisoning might not be necessary. Considerable savings could
be realized in future_reactors. This phenomenon occurred in thé MSRE be-
cause the film coefficient is the controlling mechanism for transfer of
l?5Xe to the graphite. Each future reactor concept would have to be
studied in detail to assure that this was .still true before the above

statement was applicable.

SALT-TO-GRAPHITE COUPLING

fluid to a porous medium as opposed to a continuous or homogeneous me-

dium. For example, the krypton flux from graphite to salt is given by

The mean pore entrance diameter for CGB graphite.isvless than O.1 H .
and probably closer to 0.02 i, which is extremely small compared with the
boundary layer thickness. It seems reasonable, therefore, that krypton
-is transported from the pore opening to the contihuous concentration layer
by a process of pure diffusion. Then from the continuous layer to the
bulk salt, krypton will be transported by‘conventional fluid dynamic mass
transfer. Note that since salt will not wet graphite, and because of
the small pore size, the salt-gas interface will certainly not peqetrate
inside a pore. Also inherent in this analysis is the idea that salt will
toﬁch the solid graphite matrix, even though it .will not.wet it, and
therefore the salt-gas phése interface will exist only at the pore open-
ing. In order to couple the salt to the graphite, it is necessary to
