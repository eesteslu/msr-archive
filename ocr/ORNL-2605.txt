ABSTRACT |

~ One.of the major problems in the economic evaluation of‘the application
of forced c1rculat10n, gas cooling to high tem@erature, molten salt pover
reactor systems is the definltlon of the requmred heat transfer equipment
its size and operating cost. A design study of the. salt-tongas heat ex-~
changers for such a gas-cooled system has recently been completed, and the
results are. reported ' _

Heliumy hydrogen and steam are con51dered as coolants._ The effects of é

vafylng heat exchanger tubing 31ze, coolant lnlet temperature, coolant pres~ B
sure level allowable salt pressure -drop and uranium enrichment of the molten

 

salt are demonstrated.

The relafionship between heat exchanger dimensions, fuel inventory and
blower power requirements is presented in graphiCal form for the most |
pertinent cases., Comparisons are_made of_annqal operating costs -and heat
exchanger overall size aé a function of coolant type and oﬁerating conditions.

Hydrogen isishown to bé the most effective of the coolants considered,
with steam aﬁdxhelium.being.rcughly compareble, Assuming other conditions
to be equal, helium can be made’competitive with hydrogen by operaﬁing with
a 50 - 60% higher helium temperature gradient through the heat exchanger.,
Optimum heat'exchanger geomefries based on gas blower power costs and en-
riched fuel inventory eharges requlre s total blower power investment of |
approximately 0.5% of the plant gross electrical output Hnwevev substantial
reductions in heat exchanger size can be realized by going to hlgher blower

Introduction
Since the early pﬁasee of design evaluation on a molten salt power_reactOr
system, it has been desired to inrestigate the’problems associated with the use
of gas as the primary coolant 'As a step in this direction, a design study has
been carried out to define the salt to-gas prlmary’heat exchanger which would
be required in such a system. The study concerns a reactor having a thermal
output of 640 megawatts (10% generated in blanket and removed through blanket
cooling system) and a'gross electrical output of 275 megawatts. Consideration
has been given to the use of helium, hydrogen and steam as coolants. The re-
ference design was based on the following:
| 4 primary heat exchangers
1/2" Tnconel tub:z.ng (o 050" wall)
Circumferential Inconel fins
Helium coolant - 623 1b/sec
Inlet 850°F
Outlet 1025°F
Pressure 300 psig
Cross flow
Molten Salt (Fuel 130) 1768 lb/sec
Inlet 1210°F
Outlet 1075°F
 Four pess serpentlne flow

the effects of varylng tube smze, coolant inlet temperature, coolant pressure '

A de31gn study Has been: compleued covereng the applicatlon of gas as the
'prlmafy coolant in. a molten 'salt: power reactor: system. The use - of hellum,
”hydfoven and steam was investigated: along with the effect of gas pressure ,
level, gas inlet temperature: level and tubing size.
 The ba31c heat exchanger geometry studied was a Cross, countercurrent

.flOW'arrangement with, the. molten salt (Mixture 130 - 62 mol % LiF, 37 mol %
Bebe, 1 mol % UFh) making four:- serpentlne passes‘across the gas stream (see
Fig. 2). One-half inch Inconel. tubing with. circumferential Inconel fins was
used in all the final. heat- exchanger: calculations.. Con31derat10n_wa5-g1ven

 chosen is felt to approachatheJoptimumel |

Heat.exchanger;optimizetionahas been’'based on three criteria: first,
fuel inventory in heatxexnhanger.tubes,_retufntbends and headers; second, gas
blower power requirements; and third, minimum heat exchanger container di--
mensions, Fuel inventory-was® evaluated at $1325/ft /year and. electrleal pover
at 9 mills/kwh.

Results of the study (Figs. 12 and 14) have shown that, at a given heat
exchanger gas inlet temperature with thegout@etgtemperaturenflxed, the usei
of hydrogen resvlts in a smaller unit with a lower .fuel inventory and power
requirement than either helium or;steam, However, the hazards of large scale
hydrogen usage must-be balance@ against these obvious advantages. The optimum
helium and steam heat exchanger are approximately the same in dollars invested |
in fuel and power but differ geometrically.in tha*«the stean unit is laraef'in
diameter and shorbter in length, Slnce a greater Ppremium is attached to dlameter
in the construction:of the. reqpﬂred heat eAchanger conteinment- pressure vessel,
the steam unit is Judged sllghtly inferior to.the helium unit dimen31onally. |
However, there are -important 1ncent:ves for the use of steam coollng. The
criginal cost of the steam 1nventory is negllglble and the contalnment problem
”'becomes o; minor 1mportance. In additi .on, etanderd and well deve-oped auxiliary
components can be used throughout a steam sy:stem° On this basis, 1t 1s con—: |
cluded that the application of steam to the gas cooling cycle would have eco-
nomic advantages over helium,

square of the pressure ratio (i. e., doubling pressure reduces pumping power to
one-fourth). Changing the coolant pressure level while maintalning a reason- -

ably constant blower power input affects primarily the required face area of

- the heat exchanger with coneequent changes in eontainer size,

“Increasing the allowable salt side pressure drop increases the heat ex-
chenger container diameter while reducing its length. Optimization of this
variable was not undertaken in the present design study. |

Decreasing salt enrichment by a factor of five results in a reduction
of yearly heat exchaﬁger costs by'faetors.of 2.5-h in the cases of'primarye
interest. | - | o - e

The results of a companlon study on longltudinal, countercurrent flow
of coolant over 01rcumferent1ally flnned stralght tubing showed this arrange-
ment to be somewhat less attractive than the eomparable crossflow case. Although
the heat exchanger container diameters were approximately the same, the re-
quired container lengths were 30 - 40% grester. The use of such & straight
tube geometry leads to thermal stress problems assoclated with discrete tube

plugging or flow variations from tube to tube.

the number of passes to a minimum results in the most compact heat ex-
changer geometry.

One disadvantage of this arrangement is that, since straight tubes

of one tube could lead to a serious differential thermal expansion
condition. To a lesser extent, flow disparities between separate

tubes could cause thermal stresses to be imposed on the tubing and

fiow fluctuations in individual tubes could lead to strain cycling of
tubing material. Since this condition could be relieved somewhat by

a simple geometrical arrangement such as a right angle bend in ﬁhe.tubing

at or near either the upper or lower header, it cannot be con51dered as

 

a major stumbling block to the use of this gecometry. The primary dbstacle ‘&

All final optimization- studies were done on the basils of the serpen-

tine salt tube arrangement.

 

A study was also made of the required heat exchahger gebbétry‘and
operating costs for the case of countercurrent flow of helium over cir- é
cumferentially finned tubing. The finned tubing geometry was not opbimized
80 the results may not represent the best that can be done with this heat

 

exchanger type. However, they are satisfactory as a rough tie-in with the

remainder of the study.

2. Finned Tubing
Several design restrictions imposed at the time the heat. exchanger

study was undertaken made it desirable to select a finmed tabing'fer'con;j

Inconel tubing was chosen since data on the thermal con@ucﬁ1v1ty of INOR~8

primarily from a materials cbmpatability standpoint. On the basis of
information received from the Griscom-Russell Corporation 1), a bond
efficiency of 100% was aséigned to the mechanical boﬁd between the
Tnconel fins and tubes., | |

The use of longitudinally finned tubing with the coolant in pure
countercurrent flow wasg not investigated, since llterature references( »3)
indicate a continuous longltudlnal fin to have poor heat transfer
characteristlcs. The use of a split longitudlnal fln or pin fins might
result in a competltive heat exchanger, however, these chelces were not
investigated since it was falt that 51mple mechanlcal bonding of such
fins to the tubing could not be guaranteed to give the required degree
of structural reliabllity,

The circumferentlally finned tublng configuratlon chosen was ex-
perimentally evaluated by Kays ‘and London(h). The tubing dlmen31ons
llsted below were scaled up from the experimental tube as indicateda

Tubing Size :

 The majority of the design study was- based on 1/2 inch tublng w1th T
& .050 inch wall thickness. Figure 4 presents the pertlnent 1nformatlon |
leading to the choice of this tubing size.

It can be demonstrated that the optimum salt inventory for a given
set of de51gn conditions occurs when. the unit is sized so that the salt |
pressure drop through the heat exchanger is at the ‘maximum allowable
value. This maximum is 36 psi, since 10% of the available hO psi which

by entrance and exit effects.
| Furthermore, based on the assump+1on that the amount of power to

 

plant gross electrical output as extremes, 1t is possible to define
the range of tube lengths and number of tubes which meet de31gn re-
quirements for a given tube size, |

On this basis, the lines representing the length vs number of tubes

<

at maxiium salt pressure drop for 3/4 inch, 1/2 inch and 3/8 inch tubing
with 0,050 inch wall were established, The location of the lines re-
presenting blower power investments of 0.5% and 10% of the plant gross
electrical output demonstrate that there is a fairly narrov raﬁge;of
length-number of tubes combinations which will satisfy the design re-
guirements.

Three-fourths inch tubing was judged to be.undesirable because of
the excessive length requirement, although the number of tubes required . .

for the heat exchanger was very attractive. Three-eighths inch tubing

 

was judged somewhat unsatisfactory for the opposite reason. Although
the tube length was satisfactory, the mumber:-of tubes required was
judged excessive, One-half inch tubing seemed %o represent a reasonable -

approach to optimum, although 7/16 inch tubing might be presumed eqpaily

 

satisfactory. :

It should be pointed out that increasing the wall thickness of ‘the - E
heat exchanger tubing from 0.050 to 0.060 - 0.065 inch would have a o
negligible effect on the calculations. The total resmstance of the metal " '_ E

wall to heat transfer normally approximated 10% of the overall r851stange.

lelded among four primary heat exchangers of 143.5 megawatts cepa01ty
each Coolant blower eff1c1ency was taken as 80%. Salt and hellum
phy31cal propertles were evaluated at their mean temperature in the

heat exchanger. The pressure drop distribution in the.coolant circuit

was erbitrerily assigned as follows:

Heat . Exchanger 60%
Steam Generator  30%
Ducts 10%

Fln efflclenc1es were taken from correlatlons presented by Gardner( )

| rThe salt pressure drop was taken as 40 psi. total, with 10% a351gned to

"losseso Coolant blower power cost was evaluated at 9 mills/kwh, and a load

'entrance and exit effects and 90% assigned to heat exchanger tube frlctlon :

factor of 80% was a351gned to the power plant. Enrlched fuel was assigned
a yearly cost of $1555/ft ‘based on the following factors:

Barren salt - $l278/ft
1) Capitdlized at 14%
per year $179
U-235 - $17/gram
1) .48 Mol % UF), in fuel
2) Rental at L4%/annum $1156

$1335
In calculating coolant gas pressure drop across the tube bundlie,
the head loss due to flow acceleration caused by temperature ahdapressure
change was neglected. Due to the low pressure drop and coolant tempefe-
ture rise, the error resulting from this assumption is well within the

limits of error of the overall calculation,

baffle spacing times the number of passes. All heat exnhangers falllng
along a line of constant tube bank "depth" between the number of tubes
at which the fuel Reynolds Number is 3000 (3500 tubes) and the number
of tubeg at which the fuel pressure drop is 36 psi are satisfactory
for the transfer of 143.5 megawatts from the salt to the coolant under
the conditions specified. However, those units represented by the
intersection of a line of constant tube bank "depth" with the line of
maximm fuel pressure drop represent the optimum heat exchangers from
a fuel inventory standpoint.-

Since tube bank "depth" is given in number of tube rows, the value
tust be an integer, normaily in the range of two to fifteen. Study of
the figures will make cleér that for a given blower power investment
there is one "best" heat exchanger geometry. As blower power is ine
creased, the required numwber of tubes decreases until the optimum
geometry for that tube bank "depth" is reached at the intersection
with the maximum salt pressure drop line, If this point is inside the

horizontal projection of the line representing the next higher tube bank

“depth"”, a much larger heat exchanger will also operate at this same
power level, and further power increases require heat exnhangers re-
presented by points along the higher "depth" line. If the point pre-
viously referred to is not inside the horizontal projection of ‘the nexﬁ
higher tube bank ”depth"g there is a range of power values which cannot
' be used since no suitable heat exchanger configuration exists in this
range, | B | |
" The values on the abscissa (Total Blower Power - % of Plant Gross
Electrical Output) represent the proportion of 275 megawatts which is

a551gned to power the coolant blowers in the four prlmary heat exnhanger 7

 

The pewer consumptlon of just the four heat exchangers is 60%
-';Of the abscissa value,’and the power consumptlon assignable to one heat
exnhanger is 15% of the abscissa value.

Figure 11 presents the results of the study on pure longltudinal
counte eurrent flow over circumferentially finned tubes. The case for
helium at 300 psig with an inlet temperature of 850°F is coﬁSidéred.
In this figure, the length represents the total active length of the
finned tubing and the pitch represents the tube spacing in a "delta"

arrangement.

Conclusions
Figure 12 presents optimization curves for the various cdolants
and operating conditions in the form of yearly cost of fuel inventory
and blower power for one heat exchanger versus heat exchanger container
length ard diameter. Although an economic optimum is found for each
case presented; it must be realized that the cost of heat'exchanger

 

fabrication and the effects of heat exchanger size on overall plaunt con-
struction costs have not been comsidered in this presentation, By
small percentage increases in yearly operating costs above the opbimum
velue shown in Fig. 12, sizable reductions in heat exchanger length

are r@alized. Determination of how far one should go in this direction

 

would be one necessary step in an overall plant economic analysis.

For a given set of operating conditions, hydrogen proves to be the
most attractive coolant., If it is desired to avoid the hazards of
hydrogen usage, reduction of the helium inlet temperature from 850°
te ?OO F (maintaining the outlet temperature of 1025°F constant) gives

a unit smeller and cheaper o operate than is the case for hydrogen at
the higher inlet temperature level. Use of a coolant inlet temperature
which is lower than the freezing point of the Mixture 130 (850°F com-

flow failure, some provision Would:have to be made for diversion of the
coolant stream around the heat exchanger to avoid_freezing-the salt in
the tubing. _

The use of steam as a ccolant gas appears competltlve with helium
since the containment problem is minoxr and the gas replacement costs
are negligible. The optlmum steam.heat exchanger is shorter but some-
what larger in diameter than is the cage for helium. There is es-
sentially no difference in operating cost. Another strong incentive
for the use of steam is the existence of a well developed technology
and the availability of commercial components suited to such a system.

Also presented in Figure 12 is the container dimeunsions for a
pure countercurrent flow heat exchanger using helium with an 850°F
inlet temperature in longitudinal flow over a "delta" array of circum-
ferentially finned tubing. Ignoring any particular advantage this ar-
rangement might possess which is outside the scope of the present study,
this case does not appear as attractive as the comparable crossflow case.
The container diameter is somewhat larger and the required container
length is longer throughout the operating cost range of primary interest.
In addition, this geometry does not possess the freedom for differential
thermal expansion that is inherent in the four pass serpentine salt tube,

It should be noted that the curves of Figures 12 and 13 are not
continuous as drawn (exnept for the countercurrent flow case in Flguré
12). Since each point on the curve represents a tube bank "depth" in
tube rows (one less or one greater ‘than its neighbor), héat exchangers

Inereasing the allowable salt side pressure drop means that the
length of the salt flow path can be increased. Since this increases the
available heat transfer surface per tube, the number of tubes can be re-
duced. Figure 1k shows that the end result of this change is a heat

_case with a smaller salt side pressure drop. There is a practical limit
to how far the design should be carried in this direction. When the
dlameter of the containment vessel becomes too large for the correspond«
'ing 1ength, a change to a six salt pass geometry should be investigated.
The present‘study was not carried this far, but the basic éguatiOns
‘llsted in Table 6 are applicable for this purpose.

Figure 1k also illustrates the effect of lowering uranium enrlch»
ment by a factor of five. In the area of interest, thls reduces annual

;thelr value at the higher enrichment.
| L The results of this study can be used to predlct the heat exchanger

 

'reqﬁlre&ents for increased or decreased reactor power levels for the
specifié cases and operating conditions considered. The length of the
heat exchanger is & direct function of heat load and a direct ratio can
therefore be applied to this dimension, provided the change is not so
great as to disproportionate the length-diameter relationship of the

heat exchanger container.
