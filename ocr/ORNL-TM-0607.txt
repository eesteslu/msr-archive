MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF INOR-8 CAST METAL

 

R. W. Swindeman

ABSTRACT

Tensile and stress-rupture data for INOR-8 castings
are presented., It is shown that the high-temperature strength
of castings is sufficient to allow present Molten-Salt Reactor
Experiment stresses for wrought metal to be used. At lower
temperatures, however, the tensile strength limits the maximum
stress to low values. The effect of defects in castings is
illustrated.

INTRODUCTION

Since several components in the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE)
fuel circulation system will be fabricated by casting, it is desirable
to know the limiting strength of INOR-8 cast metal. This report swummarizes
available mechanical property data on this material. Portions of the infor-
mation provided here were obtained by the Haynes-Stellite Company and are

1

reported in the literature. They are included here for completeness.

PROGRAM

Tensile tests were performed on four heats of sand-cast metal and
one heat of investment-cast metal. The chemical analyses provided by
the vendor are given in Table 1. The analyses for the investment-cast
heat are not known.

Rod specimens were machined from cast blanks and annealed at 2150°F
for 1 hr/in. of thickness. Both 0.505 and 0.250-in.-diam bars were used.
All tensile tests were performed in air at an extension rate of
0.05 in./min.

Stress-rupture tests were performed on the investment-cast heat. The

specimens were similar to those used in the tensile testing program.

During the machining of the bars from heats Nos, 8860 and 8861, it
was seen that there were flaws in the specimens. Radiography was then

performed on eight bars from these heats prior to testing.
RESULTS

Tensile data are shown in Figs. 1 through 4. The tensile strength
for sand-cast metal, shown in Fig. 1, exhibits a wide variation from
one specimen to another, especially at the low temperatures. Inspection
of radiographs and rupture surfaces revealed gross defects in at least
nine specimens. Most of the scatter in the tensile strength can,
therefore, be attributed to defects. The tensile strength for sound
cast metal is about 60% of that for wrought metal.

Fig. 2. Yield Strength of Sand-Cast INOR-8.

The 0.2% offset yield strength for sand-cast metal is shown in
Fig. 2. Here again the defective castings exhibit less strength than
the sound castings. The yield strength for cast metal is about 80% of
that for wrought metal.

The tensile elongation for sand castings is shown in Fig, 3. The
elongation improves with increasing temperature up to 800°F and
diminishes above this temperature. Most of the sound castings have
elongations better than 20% at all temperatures. The elongation is
particularly sensitive to the quality of the casting and defective
castings exhibit ductilities weil below those for sound metal. It was
noticed that failures in defective castings occurred at shrinkage cracks
and large inclusions. These flaws comprised anywhere from 10 to 40%
of the cross-sectional area of the specimen. No failures in high E

porosity regions were observed.

Fig. 3. Elongation of Sand-Cast INOR-8.

The investment castings exhibit about the same strength as sand
castings. Data for this material are shown in Fig. 4.

The only available creep data are for investment castings. These
data were obtained from short-time stress~rupture tests at temperatures
of 1100, 1300, 1500, and 1700°F and are not suitable for establishing
design stresses by conventional techniques. The Dorn-Shepard parameter?
has been used to establish a master curve from which 100,000 rupture-
stress values may be obtained. The activation energy, 83,200 cal/mole-°K,
for wrought metal? was employed. A plot of the Dorn-Shepard against

stress is shown in Fig. 5. Stress values for 100,000 hr obtained from
this curve are presented in Table 2 and compared to present MSRE design
stresses. It is apparent that, on the basis of rupture data, the wrought
metal stress values may be safely applied as design stresses for castings.
This is true for temperatures above 1150°F. Below 1150°F, however, cast
metal design stresses must be based on one fourth of the tensile strength
since these stresses will be less than those obtained from stress-rupture .
data. Inasmuch as the minimum specified tensile strength has not been
established for castings, stress values at lower temperatures are not

suggested.
