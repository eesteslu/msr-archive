AN EMF STUDY OF LiF-Ber SOLUTIONS

ABSTRACT
The potential of the cell

with the assumed cell reaction

Be(s) + 2HF(g) 2 Ber(d) + Hz(g)

was measured over a composition range of 0.30 to 0.90 mole

fraction BeF, and a temperature range of 500 to 900°C. Since
this cell potential is related to the activity of BeFy in the
solutions by |

activity coefficients could be derived for BeF; (and by a
Gibbs-Duhem integration for LiF). Usefully accurate measure-
ments could not be made with pure BeF9 in the cell, hence
values of E° were calculated using values for agep, derived
from the phase diagram and previously reported heat of

fusion (1.13 kcal/mole) giving

E° = 2.4430 - 0.0007952T

This comparison of the emf data with the LiF-BeF) phase dia-
gram also indicated that the heat of fusion for BeFy is < 2.0
kcal/mole. A power series in x[jF was assumed for log yBeF;
and the coefficients determined by a least squares fit to

the data. This gave

I. INTRODUCTION

' Molten fluoride mixtures of LiF and BeF2 are of considerable
interest at this Laboratory since they are the principal congtituents
in the molten-salt reactor (MSRE) fuel and coolant salts.l Although
the molten LiF—Ber system has received coﬁsiderable attention, only
a limited number of emf investigations have been attempted. The
development of reference electrode half—éells for molten fludrides in
general would facilitate the determinafion 6f electrode potentialé for
vérious fluoride‘constituents and the detection of certain iﬁpurities

contained in these mixtures.

The purpose of this investigation was to study the cell reaction
Be®(s) + 2HF(g) ¥ BeF,(d) + Hy(g) (1)

in the molten‘LiF—BeF2 system using BezﬂBe0 and HF,HZIF— electrodes. j
Emf data obtained in this study would'hopefully extend and improve the o
thermodynamics of this molten fluoride system. At the same time emf
measurements should demonstrate useful electrodes which may serve as
reference electrodes in future emf studies in this important ﬁolten
salt solvent system.

Thus far activity data for the LiF-BeF2 systems has been obtained

from mass spectroscopic studies of the vapor,z’3 from the pﬁase dia-

gram, '~ from emf measurements, and from transpiration data where

- gaseous HF—H20 mixtures were equilibrated with the molten fluoride mix-

ture.7 ‘The values'derived-from the phase data, besides being non-iso- -

2 liquidus has
&

been difficult to determine. In addition, the reported values4’5’7’8’9 | k-j
 

"

c -

for the heat of fusion for BeF, are not in agreement. Mass spectro-

2
scopic and emf values of the activity were determined for only a limit-
ed number of compositions and temperatures. Probably the best activi-
ty values are those determined by Mathews and Baes7 using a transpira-
tion method to equilibrate gaseous HF—HZO mixtures wiéh molten LiF—BeF2
mixtures. However, activities derived from these heterogeneous equi-
libria are somewhat limited in accuracy (+ 67%) and the equilibrium
quotients were measured in the presence of Be0 as a saturating solid
which might have influenced the activity values.

Direct determination of the activity of BeF2 by emf measurements
should yield more accurate values over a greater composition range than
any of the methods previously mentioned. Dirian, Romberger and'Baes10
measured the potential of the following cell as a function of tempera-

ture.

Be®|0.33 BeF, - 0.67 LiF|HF,H,,Pd

The cell reaction is that shown in eq. (1). The two electrodes -

Be2+]Beo and HF,HZIF# - were judged By‘Dirian et al, to be reversible
from polarization measurements.

In the_preseﬁt inveséigation thése'two electrodes were ﬁsed to
determine the cell potential over a composition range of 0.30 to 0.90
mole fraction Ber'and.a temperature range of 500 to 900°C (Fig. 1).

An atteﬁpt waé made to obtain measurements in pure BeFé, but results
of useful accuracy could not be obtained presumably because of its high
viscosity and/or hiéh eleétfical resispivity. Even at 900°C, ﬁure Ber

is very viscous (about 180 poisell). The reaction vessel was not heat-

ed above 900°C because of the tendency of nickel to soften at such

.elevated temperatures. The melting points of mixtures below 0.33 Be‘F2

increase rapidly as the concentration approaches pure LiF as shown in

2

(below 0.30 BeFZ) were not investigated therefore since the accessible

the LiF-BeF phase‘diagram12 in Fig. 1. The lower BeF2 concentrations
temperature range‘wasAso limited.

According to the assumed cell reaction (eq. 1), the cell potential
should be dependeﬁt on the activity of BeF,, the activity of beryllium

metal, and the partial pressures of HF and H

was at elevated temperatures.

The reaction vessel was located inside an upright tube furnace,
the tempefature was controlled by an L & N Series 60 D.A.T. Con£r01
Unit. The temperature of the{reaction vessel was checked with a cali-
brated Chromel-Alumel thermocouple and an L & N K-3 potentiometer.

A 4-in. diameter vessel, fitted with 1/2-in. diameter electrode
compartments, was used for preliminary meésurements. Electrodés used
in the cylindrical compartments were insulated-from the compartment
walls with boron nitride spacers, but even then accidental’ele;triéal
shorts were a problem. = The large compartments of the reaction vessel
used in the present investigation eliminated'the need for insﬁlating
spacers except the Teflon seai at the top of the compaftment, and no
problems froﬁ electrical shorting were encountered.

HF—-H2 Electrode

 

An H,_,HF,Pd electrode of the type used by Dirian and Rom‘berger10

23
was used in some of the preliminary measurements. This electrode
produced stable potentials but was quite noisy (+ 1 mv). Platinum
gauze was substituted for the palladium and was found to be just as
responsive and capable of very low noise levels (0.1 mv). The platin-
um gauze type (Fig. 4) was used for all measurements in this inveéti-
gation. Electrodes were prepared by formiﬁg an egg-shaped bag with th-
- gauze and slipping the open eﬁd over 1/8-in. nickel tubing.and tying

it securely with small diameter nickel wire; The other end of the-bag

was crimped together so that the HF-H, mixture, passing down through

2
the nickel tubing had to pass through the gauze. The 1/8-in. nickel

tubing transmitted the HF—H2 mixture and provided electrical contact.

Beryllium Electrode

These electrodés (Fig. 4) were constructed by slipping a berylli-
um metal cylinder (3/8-inf 0.D., 1/8-in. I.D., and 1/2-in. length)
over a 1/8-in. nickel tube and crimping the nickel tube slightly on
each side of the beryllium cylinder to hold it securely. The cylinder
was positioned about 1/2-in. from the tip of the nickel tube. Lower-
ing the beryllium metal closer to the tip of the nickel tube caused an
increase in the potential noise. This was probably due to helium
bubbles temporarily insulating the beryllium from~the’me1t. The 1/8-
in. nickel tube was used to bubble helium into the compartment and to
provide electrical contact.
Flow Control of Gases

Hydrogen Fluoride.-- The HF manifold pressure was controlled by
regulating the temperature of the HF supply cylinder. The flow of HF
was controlled by a mass spectrometer leak valve.13 The gas flowed to
a monel tee wheré it mixed with H,. The mixed gases were passéd either

2

directly to the HF-H, electrode or a portion was split off for in-

2

fluent gas analysis.
szrogen.-- A pressure relief valve (Moore Products Company, dif-

ferential type flow controlier, Model 63 BD, modified form) was used

to reduce the hydrogen manifold pressure to a constant value of 3.0 1b.

pressure since a constané.flow through the.beryllium electrode was un-
necessary. ;
Titration Assembly %

The NaOH titration vessel was a 200-ml test tube. A rubber stop-
per was inserted into the test tube and was equipped with the following:
Teflon (1/4-in. dia.) entrance and exit tubes for gas, a 5-ml Lab—
Crest microburet, and Beckman No. 39166 (glass, Ag-AgCl) electrodes.
A Beckman Zeromatic II pH meter was used to determine the endpoint.
The pH was maintained on the alkaline side of the endpoint to avoid
glass attack. Duplicate titration.assemblies were used to measure in-
fluent and effluent HF concentrétions.
Electronic Equipment

An L & N K-3 potentiometer, calibrated with a standard cell from

Epplg& Laboratory, Inc., was used to buck out most of the cell voltage.

When the cell voltage exceeded the range of the potentiometer, a

mercury battery (Mallory Duracell No. RM 42R) was connected in series

to extend the bucking voltage range. The voltage of the battery was
checked daily with the potentiometer, and it proved to be an extremely
stable voltage squrce‘Qt 0.02 mv/day). The remainder of the cell volt-
age (< 100 mv) was coupled, through a Philbrick Model MP solid state
operational manifold equipped with P65 AU amplifiers, to-a Honeywell
Brown Electronik recorder. | |

Procedure

Measurements

The data obtained for each cell measurement were cell potential,

cell temperature, and partial pressures of HF and Hz._

 
 

 

 

14

Cell Potential.—- Cell potential measurements were always preced-
ed by standardization of the potentiometer against a standard cell and

a check of the amplifier zero on the recorder. During measurements of

-

ﬁhe cell potential, most of the voltage was.bucked'oqt by the potentio-
meter (or potentiometer plus=mercﬁry battéry), and the remainder read
off the recorder. The noise level of the potential varied from|i.0.2
mv- to as high as + 1.0 mv for the high viscosity melts; Although the
potential fluctuated as‘indicated, it did not show.any drift toward a
‘higher or lower potential.

Hz'and HF Partial Pressures.—— The determination of partial

pressures was made as follows:

(1) A measured volume of standardized NaOH was added to the

titration vessel.

(2) The time required for the HF to neutralize the base was

determined.

(3) H2 flow rates were determined by the use of a Bubble-0-

Meter.
(4) Influent partial pressures were checked simultaneously in
experiments up to .60 Ber.
(5) Partiallpressure determinations were never begun until the

cell potential had been steady for at least 30 minutes.
(6) Six to ten successive titrations were carried out.

(7) The barometric pressure, temperature of the titraticn as-

sembly, and pressure drop across the system were recorded.

(8) Helium flowed through the beryllium electrode at a rate of
30 to 75 ml/min. This flow rate provided adequate sparging
for this compartment and decreased the thermal gradients.

Helium also protected the electrode from any HF which might
 

 

-\

L 1

-

titrator, and the saturation of the H

15

have entered the compartment.

Melt Temperature.—- The temperature of the melt was determined by

 

a calibrated Chromel—Aiumel thermocouplé positioned carefully to the
exact depth of the electrode. Positioning was carried out as accurate-
ly as possible to reducé any error in temperature readings caused by
thermal gradiehts in the melt.

Calculations.—— The required calculations to evaluate PHF,PH2 and
EC were carried out as follows:

(1) The titration times were averaged for a series of titrations
of a fixed incremenf of standard base. The gas volume passed was then
calculated by (time of titration)/(time per 1007m1 of gas) x 100 = ml
of gas.

(2) The number of millimoles of HF removed from the H, stream by

2
the titration was calculated by

(ml NaOH) (conc. of NaOH) = millimoles HF.
(3) It was found conyenient first to define an approximate
partial pressure of HF (P;F) by introducing these measured quantities
into the following simple gas law expression

'0 (mmoles HF) (0.08206) (abs.temp. of Bubble-0-Meter)
P =
HF ' | ml of H2 passed

: 0
RT
= nHF'va—

' The exact expression for the partial pressure of HF-(PHF) at the e-

lectrode includes the effect of the pressure drop (AP) caused by the

pressure required to maintain bubbling through the melt and subsequent

2 stream with water prior to

measuring the flow rate. The relationship (eq. 11) between P;F and

 
 

 

 

16

PHF which is required was developed as follows:

(3.1) The system may be visualized as con51st1ng of three
regions — the cell vessel (at PT T), the titration assembly, and
the Bubble—O—Meter (at P° T T ).

Systematic Errors
The preceding method of calculating partial pressures does not in-

clude corrections for the diffusion of H, through the walls of the

2
nickel reaction vessel, nor does it consider the effect of thermal dif-
fusion. Melt purity and composition should also be considered as
sources of systemafic errors.

Hydrogen Diffuéion.-- According to published diffusion coef-
ficients,14 the diffusion of HZ out of the nickel readtion vesselr
could be a few millilitefs per minute at elevated temperétures. The
rgte of.H2 diffusion was measured experimentally by yathews and.Baes?
in a vessel similar to the one used in the present experimeﬁt. They
obtained the following rates: 700°C, 0.035 ml/sec; 650°C, 0.025 ml/sec;
600°cC, 0.615 ml/sec. Extnapolatibh of these measurements to 800°C and
900°C yields diffusion rates of 0.055 ml/sec and 0.075 ﬁl/sec, re-
spectively. Typically emf'experiments were condﬁcted with a H2 flow

rate of 2.5 ml/sec. This means that the measured volume of H, would

2
be in error by 0.6% at 600°C, 1.40% at 700°C, 2.20% at 800°C, and 3.00%

at 900°C. These errors in partial pressures would cause the calculated
potential to be about 1.0 mV lower at 700°C, 1.5 mV lower at 800°C,

and 2.0 mV at 900°C. As mentioned previously, the HF-H, mixtures were

2

analyzed before and after entering the HF—H2 electrode compartment, and
no discrepancy between the two could be detected. These analyses were

performed periodically on all compositions up to .60 BeF and tempera-

2

tures up to 700°C. Melts of higher BeF, concentrations were not check-

2

ed in this manner because difficulty was encountered in keeping the

flow rate constant through these high viécosity melts when the split
 

 

 

 

 

 

&

flow technique Wéé attempted.

Since the H2 diffusion effect was not observed at temperatures up
to 700°C, the errors calculated above seem to be somewhat high.

Thermal Diffusion.—- Recognizing the possibility that H2 and HF
might tend to separate along the thermal gradient in the reaction
vessel, we carried out an experiment to see if this effect was signifi-
cant.

The total flow of HF-H2 passing through the HF—H2 electrode was
varied between 23 ml/min and 160 ml/min. The cell potential increased
by about one millivolt over this range; the increase in cell potential
over the range of flow rates where potential measurements were actually
made (100-160 ml/min) was less than 0.3 millivolt. This is thought to
be sufficient evidence that the thermal diffusion effect was not sig-
nificant.

Gas Cooling Effect .on Electrodes.-- The experiment mentioned above
also indicates that cooling of the electrodes by gas flow could not

have caused more than a one millivolt error in the potential measure-

ments. It was felt that although the possibility of a small error in

‘potential might result from flow rates of 100-160 ml/min, vigorous agi-

tation of the melt was necessary to reduce the effect of thermal'
gradients iﬁ the melt. |

Melt Composition.—- A composition error which was discovered at
the end of run No. 4 was apparently caused by distillation of‘Ber to
coqle: regions of the apparatus. In this{particular run, many attempts
were made to measure thé cell potential of pure BeF2 oﬁer a temperature

range of 800°C to 900°C. At these elevated temperatures the vapor

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

20

15

‘pressure of BeF, is appreciable. Evidently loss of BeF2 occurred

2
during the periods ét“high temperatures. Subsequent additions of LiF

were made to bring the BeF2 composition down to 0.90 BéFz, 0.80 Ber,

0.70 BeF,, and finally to 0.33 BeF,.  The error was discovered at 0.33

2

BeF2 since the potentials did not correspond to previous measurements.

2°

At this point enough BeF.; was added to bring the composition up to a

2

book value of 0.40 BeF, permitting thermal analysis of the liquidus

2

temperature. Thermal analysis was carried out and compared with the

2

was 0.388 BeF,. Assuming that all or most of the BeF, was lost before

the LiF additions were begun, the compositions at 0.90, 0.80, and 0.70

- LiF-BeF, liquidus data.16 Results indicated that the true composition

BeF2

in Ec in the 0.60 Ber to 0.80 BeF2 regions are small; thus, the compo-

sition error at these concentrations should not be significant. How-

were reduced to 0.896, 0.791, and 0.686-$eF2, respectively. Changes

ever, the values obtained for 0.33 BeF, in this run were more seriously

2
raffected by the uncertainty in composition and were not used.

Melt Impurities.-— Early in the experimental work it was found
that commercial Ber which contained about 1000-2000 ppm sulfur and
1000 ppm total of Fe, Cr, Cu, and Ni caused "poisoning" of both elect-
rodesl‘ The cell potential would decay as much as 0.5 volts. Spectro;
graphic examination of the Be electrode showed that Fe, Cr,'énd Ni had
~ been reduced on the surface of the electrode; also metallic impurities
originally in the beryllium metal were much higher in concentration on

the electrode surface after exposure to the melt. These included Al,

- Mn, and Ti, the most abundant one being aluminum.
 

oy

*

21

The platinum gauze on the HFfH2 electrode was darkened by exposure
to these contaminated melts. This effect was not pursued since it was

already evident that BeF, with the impurities mentioned above was not

2
suitable for use with the beryllium electrode.

Distilled Ber, containing only trace amounts of impurities, was
tested; and none of the problems mentioned above were encountered. This

material was used for all measurements in this investigation.

Oxide Contamination of Melt.—- The oxide chemistry of LiF—BeF2

 

mixtures must be considered since the raw materiéls contain small a-
mounts of moisture, and since beryllium oxide is an impurity in beryl-
lium metal. Moisture contamination of the melt was kept to a minimum
By freezing the mixtures prior to additions of raw materials. Beryl-
iium'fluoride was stored in a‘dry box prior to use.

A standard purification procedure for removing oxides17 from fluo~
ride mixture is HF—H2 sparging. This procedure was used throughaut the
present investigation to remove oxide impurities from the melts. Con-
tinuous use of HF—H2 as one of the electrode materials undoubtedly kept
the oxide concentration small. Typically, beryllium metal contains a-
bout 1000 fo 4000 ppm oxygen.l8 ﬁéing‘the larger value for oxide con-
tamination,;the maximum concenﬁration of oxide contributed by the beryl-
lium electrode would have been 1 x 107> moles/kg, which is about one
order of magnitude below the solubility of Be0.19' Theréfore, no sig-
nificant error is expected due to oxide contamination of the melt by

addition of raw materials or from the metal electrode.

Summary.— The only known systematic errors that might be signifi-

cant are those attributed to H_, diffusion and gas cooling of the

2

electrodes. These are opposite in effect, and both are expected to be
within the experimental scatter of the data.

Random: Errors

In order to obﬁain a satisfactofy estimate of the expected pré;
cisién of the‘experimentél measurements, the various random errors and
their probable magnitude were considered.

Precision of Potential Measurements.-- Tyﬁically short term po-
tential fluctuations were about + 0.2 mV for mixtures up to 0.60 Ber.

These fluctuations increased to about + 1.0 mV for 0.90 BeF, mixtures.

However, even at the higher Ber'concentrationS, the average value of
the potential did not change more than + 1.0 mV over a period of one to
two hours. | .

Melt Temperature.-— The temperature of the melt was controlled to

 

+ 0.2°C. The temperature gradient in the melt varied from about 2°C in

melts up to 0.60 BeF,, to a maximum of 9°C in 0.90 BeF,. However, care

23
was taken during each potential measurement to position the thermo-
couple in the melt so that it coincided within + 1/8-in. of the elect-
rode depths. Tﬁis should have reduced the temperature uncertainty to
no more than + 0.5°C, which corresponds to an uncertainty of + 0.4 mV
in the potential.

Melt Composition.-~ The LiF-BeF, mixtures were prepared by adding

2

 

‘'weighed amounts of the components to the reaction vessel. The pre-

- cision of weighing and transferring materials to the vessel was about

+ 0.2%.

23

Titer Precision.-- Commercial 1N NaOH in one quart bottles was
standardized with potassium acid phthalate. Agreement of the standard-
ization values was ebout + 0.1% of the average value. The uncertainty
in burette readings during HF titrations was about + 0.5%.

Temperature of Bubble-0-Meter.-—- The Bubble-O-Meter temperature,
which was the temperature of the gas as its volume was being measured,
varied no more than + 0.1°C during a given experiment. The same tem-
perature variation applies to the titration vessel where the H2 wasi
saturated with water.

Flow Rate Determination.-- The precision in the timing of H2 flow
rates was 0.1 sec per 100 ml. For a typical value of 50 seconds per
100 ml1, this would ameunt to 0.2%.

Endpoint Precision.-- The preeision in timing of the endpoints was
about + 0.3Z of the measured value.

H, and HF Flow Rates.-- The H, flow rate was constant at + 0.1% of

2 2
the measured value. Successive HF titrations varied as mueh as + 1.0%
from the average value. This was apparently due to irregular flow rates
of HF. The variation was random and no bias was noted. The error in-
volved in HF flow rate is muchrgreater than:any of the other errors as-

HE® therefore the others will be coe—
sidered negligible.
Statistical Error Analysis

~ The probable error to be expected in the calculated cell potential,
Ec ﬁae determined from the'estimatedmagnitude ef.random errors in

various quantities which appear in eq. 3. If the contribution of each

observable is related to a calculated function Q and expressed as

Q = f (a,b:c-"--):
the contribution of such errors can be calculated. If the errors fol-
low a normal distribution, it can be shown20 that the following equa-

tion allows for partial cancellation of errors of opposite sign:

Evaluating the above equation numerically for the uncertainty in the
calculated potential, using typical partial pressures of HF and H2 at a
temperature of 1000°K and usiﬁg the estimated uncertainties of + 0.5 mV,

+ 0.5°C, + 0.001 atm respectively in E, T, and PHF,'one obtains

The calculated standard deviafion of + 2.2 mV is slightly larger than

The range of the standard deviation for the actual data was about 1.0 mV -
to 2.0 mV. The major uncertaipty is in the PHF term and is due to the

limited precision of HF f1ow.

In the second series the reaction vessel was initially loaded with

pure Ber, enough LiF was then added to give 0.90 BeF,, 0.80 Ber, 0.70

0.50 BeFZ, 0.40 Ber, and finally 0.33 BeFZ. Only one

Ber, 0.6Q_BeF2,

or two determinations were made for 0.60 BeF2 and lower BeF2 compo-
sitions since these were checks of previous measurements.
Pure BeF2 was also the initial composition for the third series of

measurements. Subsequent additions of LiF were made to give 0.90, 0.80,

0.70, 0.60, and 0.33 BeF As previously mentioned the data for 0.33

Corrected Cell Potentials

The corrected cell potentials (Ec) for various compositions are

plotted as a function of temperature and shown in Fig. 5. EC is assumed

to be a linear function of temperature, Ec = A+BT, over the temperature
range investigated. The data points for each composition were least
squared, and the calculated lines are also shown in Fig. 5. The para-

meters from the least squaring treatment are listed in Table 2.

IV. DISCUSSION

Thermodynamics of LiF—BeF2

The activity of BeF, may be calculated from eq. (4) using the emf
data (Ec) obtained in this study if the appropriate values for the
standard cell potential (E°) are known. As mentioned previously, sever-
al attempts were made to determine E° experimentally, but values of use-
ful accuraéy could\ndt be obtained because‘of high melt viscosity and
possibly because of high electrical resistivity.

The values of E_ obtained,for Qarious BeF, compositions do not lend

2

themselves to_direct‘extrapolation to E°. However, the standard cell

potential may be calculated by'relating data in this study with the BeF2

liquidus data in the following manner. If the assumption is made that

the standard cell potential (E°) varies linearly with temperature

 
 

 

 

 

30

(E® = A+BT)#* then eq. (4) may be written

'Ec = (A+BT) - RL fn a

It is then possible to equate eq. (15) to

bove expression as 2FEc/T Vs 1/T_shou1d be linear since the intercept
and slope’contain only constants. Using the least square parameters for
each composition (Table 2), values for Ec were calculated for the
liquidﬁs temperatures at 0.515, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80$and 0.90-BeF2 (see
footnoté ) and then plofted according fo eq. (17) (Fig. 6). The result-

ing points follow the predicted linear relationship within their pre-

Intercept = - 0.03805 + 0.0034,(Kcal/°K) = 2FB - ==  (18)

B
Slope = 113.84 + 2.48 ,(Kcal) = 2FA + AH, (19)

The point at 0.90 BeF, was not used because the uncertainty in Ec is

2
relatively large.

Values for A and B were calculated using various literature values

for the heat of fusion of BeF, and a melting point of 555°C for pure

2
Ber. A tabulation of these values is shown in Table 3. The values of
A and B which are consistent with values obtained in the present in-
vestigation are thosé for which the heat of fusion is assumed to be 2.0

kcal/mole yields values of E® which are greater than corresponding vaiues
of Ec at the higher Ber concentration. This creates an impossible
situation where the activity of Ber in thenmixture is greater than the
activity of pure liquid Ber. Thus measurements in the present study

clearly support the lower values for the heat of fusion for BeFZ.

shown in- Fig. 8; The pressure corrected cell potentials (Ec) differed
by 1.4097 standafd deviations from the smoothed values given by eq; 4-1
(Table\&); and the average deviation of Ec from smoothed values was

approximately 1_2.5 mV. The average deviation is consistent with the

value predicted by the error analysis for E_.

A Gibbs-Duhem‘integration of the expregsion for YBer Table 4) was
carried out to give the corresponding exﬁ;;ésion for Y1iF (eq. 4-4,
Table 4). The integration constant for eq. 4-4 was determined by com-
parison with YiiF values derived from the liquidus data12 and a heat of
fusion of 6.47 kcal/mole for LiF. A more accurate evaluation of the
integration constant should be possible when the heat of mixing measure-
ments.of Holm and Kleppa22 become available'for the LiF-BeF2 system.

Smoothed values of YBer are shown as a function of composition at
several temperatures in Fig. 9. These results are consistent with thosé
obtained by Mathews and Baes7 over a composition range 0.30 to 0.60 Ber.

However, at x > 0.60 the results are not in agreement. The values

BeF2

obtained in the present study are thought to be the more reliable since
they are consistent with both the phase data and with a low heat of

fusion for BeF The previous measurements at compositions > 0.60 BeF2

9
might be in error because of difficulties in mixing LiF—BeF2 at high
BeF2 concentrations and because of the effects of BeQ saturation. 1In
the present study it was found that at 0.90 Ber, a well-mixed melt was
not obtained until the temperature was raised above 850°C. This pro-
cedure was followed for all high BgF2 concentrations to ensure pr0pér

-mixing of the LiF-BeF Another possible error in the previous measure-

2
ments could have been thegprésepce of BeO as a saturating solid. The
solubility of Bed ﬁight téﬁd té influence the Ber activity more at high
Bng concentrations. ‘ o

The free energy ahdﬁeat of the cell re;ction (eq. 1) were calcu-

, | | , |
lated assuming a heat of fusion for BeF, = 1.13 kcal/mole. These values

combined with the available thermochemical values for HF21 were used

to derive the free energy and heat of formation for liquid BeF2 at 900°K
(Table 5). Mathews and Baes7 measured the equilibrium quotient for the
reaction

H20(g) + BeFé(d) 2z ZHF(g) + BeO(s) (20)

If eq. (20) is combined with the reaction in eq. (1) the resulting re-

action is

- H,0(g) + Be(s) 2 BeO(s) + H,(g) (21)

The free energy and heat of this last reaction thus could be obtained by

combining the two sets of measurements, and, since the thermochemical

data for HZO,are accurately known, improved free energy and heats of
formation for Be0 could be calculated. These are shown in Table 5. The
preceding calculations for BeF2 and Be0 were made for a temperature of

900°K. Values for other temperatures were generated using the heat

capacity data in the JANAF Tables.21

Reference Electrodes

Both electrode half-cells used in the present investigation per-
fomed acceptably for use as feference electrodes, both being stable and
reproduciﬁle.

The Be]Be2+-e1ectrode should work well in any melt containing beryl-
lium ions and no reducible cations. Potential fluctuatipns dug to this
electrode were’masked in the present study by the fluctuations due to
the HF-H2 electrode,‘but»should be less than + 0.1 mV. Beryllium e-

lectrodes were fabricated from three different batches of beryllium

metal and no discrepancies in potentials were noted when the electrodes

were interchanged. Therefore, the electrode response does not appear to
be a function of a particular batch of beryliium metal.

The beryllium electrode does not appear to be suitable for small
cell compartments since mass transfer causes the electrode to become en-
larged due to spongy deposition of the Be metal, and eventually electri-
cal shorts develop between the electrode and the cell compartment wall.

HF—H2 Electrode

The Pt, HF,H2|F- electrode should be a suitable reference electrode
in any fluoride—containing melt where there is no possibility of oxida-~
tion'by HF or reduction by H2. Tﬁe solubility of HF in LiF—Ber,is
low23 (about 0.0003 mole fracfion for the pértial préssures of HF used
in this study), and no significant solubility of H2 is expected in this
system. Potential fluctuations due to this electrode appéar to be a
function of the melt viscosity. Fluctuations are about + .1 mV in melts
with a viscosity of one poise or less. |

The precision ;frthis electrode was limited somewhat in the present
study by the method of HF delivery, as previously mentioned. In future

experiments the HZ-HF mixture will be obtained by passing H, through a

2
thermostated NaHF2 bed. It is hoped that this will be a more precise

method of producing mixtures of Hfrand H2 of constant composition.
