ABSTRACT

Fission product and 233pg decay heat and concentrations have
been calculated for a single-region MSR for reactor equilibrium con-
ditions and as a function of decay cooling time. The MSR is_a
2000-Mw(e) system containing 2000 ft3 of LiF-BeFo-ThF4-233UF
fuel. Three operating modes were studied: (1) inert gas sparging
to remove noble gases from the fuel, (2) inert gas sparging plus re-
moval of noble metals by reaction with surfaces of the heat exchanger
loop, and (3) removal of all fission products by chemical processing
only. In all three cases the fuel was being processed in a chemical
plant on a 38-day cycle. Tabular and graphic data are presented for
32 fission product elements and 233Pa for decay times up to 11 years.

INTRODUCTION

A primary concern in the design of a nuclear reactor is the removal of the after-
heat when the reactor is shut down. The problem becomes acute when it is assumed
that the shutdown is unscheduled due to an emergency that has disrupted the normal
cooling system of the reactor. In the case of the Molten Salt Reactor, this requires
draining the fuel into a receiver where emergency cooling is provided. Proper design
of this emergency cooling system is therefore essential to safe operation of the reactor.

This study has been carried out to determine the afterheat as a function of time

after fuel has been drained from the reactor. The reactor system considered is a
2000-Mw(e), single-region MSR containing 2000 ft3 of LiF-BeFp-ThF4-233UF4
fuel; the composition of the fuel carrier is respectively 52, 36, 12 mole %. In
addition to sufficient 233U for criticality, the fuel contains about 0.256 g/liter of

3Pq plus fission products. It was assumed that the reactor had been operating long
enough so that fission products were present in equilibrium concentrations for the
chosen processing conditions. Three processing modes were considered in determining
fission product concentrations: (1) all fission products removed on a 38-day cycle
through the processing plant; (2) noble gases removed by sparging and the remaining
fission products removed by chemical processing; and (3) noble gases sparged, noble
metals plated out on reactor surfaces, and the remaining nuclides removed by chemical
processing.

Protactinium is removed on a three-day cycle in a separate processing step.
About 7% of the 233Pa (14.5 kg) is in the circulating fuel; the remainder (190.5 kg)
is held in the processing plant. The system has a breeding ratio of 1.076.

Heat generation and inventory data were calculated for both fission products
and 233Pq from equilibrium to about 11 year's decay. At equilibrium gross fission
products and 233Pq in the fuel are generating about 289.4 Mw and 0.74 Mw,
respectively; an additional 9.7 Mw is being generated by 233Pq in the processing
plant.  When gases are sparged in the reactor, the fission product contribution is
reduced to 257 Mw, and, when both noble gases and noble metals are absent, the
rate is further reduced to 255.8 Mw. The fission product concentrations for these
three processing modes are respectively 3.08, 1.94, and 1.48 g/liter.

The principal source of heat is the short-lived fission products having half-lives
less than a few minutes. Hence, there is an initial large decrease in the heat genera-
tion rate when fissioning ceases. In the first 2 min after shutdown, the rate is down
by a factor of 3, in 18 min by a factor of 4.5, in 1 hr by a factor of 7, and in
10 hr by a factor of 17. Protactinium-233, which has a 27.4-day half-life, does
not show a significant decrease in heat production until about 15 to 20 days after
shutdown,

Extensive tables and graphs in later sections of this memorandum describe more
completely the thermal characteristics of this fuel for cooling times up to about
11 years.
A further interesting result of this study is the importance of just a few fission
products in the total heat generation rate. For example, at equilibrium, Rb, Cs,
and Sb, respectively, account for 22.8, 21, and 17.3% of fission product decay
heat. At 1 hour's decay, the figures are 18.6% I, 13% Kr, 10.5% La, and 9.6%
Y; at 10 hour's decay, the values are 23.8% |, 16.5% Lla, and 11.4% Y. For
much longer decay times (e.g., 125 days), about 80% of the decay heat is due to
Nb, Zr, Pr, and Y.

In the period two days to five months after reactor shutdown, more heat is being
generated by the massive amount of 3Pa in the processing plant than by decay of
gross fission products (see Fig. 2, page 13).

METHOD OF CALCULATION

Equilibrium concentrations of fission products were calculated by the HTGN
code written by Watson.!  This program treats 290 fission product nuclides and
accounts for their removal by chemical processing, neutron capture, decay, gas
sparging, and sorption on reactor surfaces. Production is a function of the fission
rate and characteristic yield. Decay heat and concentrations at equilibrium and
after shutdown were calculated by the CALDRON code written by Carter.2 This
program treats 469 nuclides and was written to describe the behavior of fuel in a
chemical processing plant. Beta heat, gamma heat, and concentration are calcu-
lated for each of the 469 nuclides as a function of time. The program accounts for
branching in the decay chains, and, in the case of chemical processing, allows the
removal and accumulation of specified nuclides in various process operations.

AVERAGE LIFETIMES OF NOBLE GASES AND NOBLE METALS

It is well established that for good breeding performance the fission product
xenon must be quickly removed from the fission zone. This is accomplished by
sparging the circulating fuel with an inert gas; this action also removes krypton.
Competing with sparging for removal of noble gas atoms are radioactive decay,
neutron capture, diffusion into the graphite moderator, and chemical processing.
Studies and experience in MSRE operation indicate that the sparging rate needs to
be sufficiently vigorous that the average residence time of a gas atom in the fuel is
only about 50 sec for maintaining tolerable xenon poisoning. |

Secondly, there is a group of fission products (Se, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd,

Ag, In, Te) whose behavior in the system is not entirely understood, but it is be-
lieved that these elements distribute throughout the circulating fuel loop by reactirg
with or otherwise attaching themselves to surfaces contacted by the fuel. This group
is known as the noble metals. Competing events for the removal of the noble metals
are radioactive decay, neutron capture, and chemical processing. The average life-
time for this "plating out" effect is probably different for each of these elements,
and the data are not available for determining the values very accurately. MSRE
data for fission product distribution in the reactor system were examined by Watson,4
who concluded that a value of 50 hr is reasonable for the average lifetime of the
noble metals. The scatter and paucity of the data did not warrant assigning a charac-
teristic lifetime to each element; so the 50-hr figure was assumed to apply to all.

REACTOR OPERATING CONDITIONS FOR WHICH DECAY
HEAT RATES ARE COMPUTED

Fission Products

The three following situations were considered in the HTGN and CALDRON
computations for determining the equilibrium heat and afterheat rates for decaying
fission products:

1. Gross amounts of fission products in the fuel, that is, no sparging of
noble gases and no plating out of noble metals.

2, Noble gases sparged on 50-sec cycle but no plating out of noble metals.
3. Noble gases sparged on 50-sec cycle and noble metals plated out on
50-hr cycle.

In each case equilibrium concentrations were calculated for a 38-day chemical
processing cycle and the characteristic losses due to neutron absorption and radioactive
decay. However, in the case of the gases, the computer program does not provide

for removal due to diffusion into the graphite.
 

In the computer program freatment of Cases 2 and 3, sparging and plating out
has the effect not only of removing the noble gases and noble metals but also of re-
moving daughter products of these elements. While this treatment is quite proper
for gases which are quantitatively removed from the fuel environment, it is not as
rigorous for noble metal decay products. Noble metals attached to reactor, piping,
and heat exchanger surfaces are always in contact with fuel, and decay products,
which are not noble to these surfaces, might reenter the fuel stream. The calcula-
tions on Cases 2 and 3 include only the daughter products of the noble gases and
metals that are associated with the equilibrium amounts of these gases and metals in
the fuel.

Protactinium

The amount of 233pq present in the system had been determined previously by
Kerr.5 His results stated that for a 3-day processing cycle for protactinium there
would be 14.5 kg 233pq (0.256 g/liter) in the circulating fuel stream and an addi-
tional 190.5 kg in the processing plant. The calculation of 233pPq afterheat was
then straightforward, since the chain terminates with a single decay. The beta and
gamma decay energies are respectively 9.3 and 41.5 w/g, totaling 50.8 w/g.

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS

Comparison of Cases 1, 2, and 3

The heat generation rates as a function of time after reactor shutdown given in
Tables 1, 2, and 3 were calculated for the three assumed reactor operating conditions
described above. A graphic gresen'ration of the total B + y heat generation is
given in Fig. 1. Values for 33Pq in these exhibits are for 233Pa in the fuel stream
only.

The effect on decay heat rate of removing noble gases and noble metals is shown
by the three fission product curves of Fig. 1. At equilibrium the effect of sparging
and plating is to decrease the gross decay heat by about 11.6%. However, the effect
on heat generation after fuel is dumped from the reactor is more pronounced, particu-
larly during the first hour or so. During this period, heat generation for the sparged
and "plated out" fuel is as much as 33% smaller than the gross fission product case
(Table 4). After the first hour of decay, the effect of removing gases and noble
metals is less pronounced but still reduces the decay heat by about 20% on the
average for the next year. After three year's decay there is a considerably larger
difference between the decay curves because the long-lived daughters of krypton and
xenon are absent from the sparged fuel. However, by this time the decay heat gener-
ation rate is small even for gross fission products; so the significance of this difference
is minor.

The extreme right columns of Tables 1, 2, and 3 give the total of 233pq and
fission product decay heat in the fuel stream. These heat generation rates govern
the design of the afterheat cooling system for dumped fuel. Decay heat of 233pq,
which is present at equilibrium at about 7.25 g/f'r3 for a 3-day processing cycle,
is only a small portion of the total decay heat except in the one- to three-month
period after discharge from the reactor.

233Pa Inventory and Heat Generation

For a 233pq processing cycle of three days the total 233pq inventory in the
system is 205 kg, of which 14.5 kg are in the circulating fuel and 190.5 kg in the
processing plant. The inventory and heat generation rate as a function of time after
the reactor stops operating are given in Table 5 and Fig. 2. The equilibrium heat
generation in decay storage is 9.7 Mw, and, unlike the fission product decay heat,
this rate does not show a significant decrease until about three weeks after shutdown.
In fact, in the decay period of two days to five months more heat is being generated
by 233pg than by gross fission products.

Distribution of Decay Heat Among Fission Products

Tables 6 and 7 have been prepared to show the distribution of decay heat
among the fission products. Values are given for equilibrium and for selected decay
times. Each entry for an element gives the summation of the decay heat rates for
all isotopes of that element. The noble gases and noble metals are exhibited sep-
arately as the two bottom rows of the tables. These particular values are for the
noble gases and noble metals only, that is, they do not include the decay energies
of the daughter products of these nuclides.

The columns of Table 7 are arranged in descending order of heat generation
rate. |t is interesting to note that over 50% of the total decay energy is associated
with only three or four elements. In the immediate period after shutdown, iodine
has the largest decay energy; for longer decayed fuel, lanthanum, zirconium, and
niobium have the most energy.

Additional Data

The data reported herein are a small portion of the data that are available in
the CALDRON output. This summary should satisfy most of the needs for decay heat
data. However, complete inventory plus beta and gamma decay energies are avail-
able for all fission product nuclides for each of the three cases. For example, if
one is interested in information on selected nuclides or a particular mass chain as a
function of their decay time, the data can be easily obtained.
