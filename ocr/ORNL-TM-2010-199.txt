FOREWORD

During the spring of 2010, a multidisciplinary team of reactor systems specialists and nuclear
technologists was assembled at Oak Ridge National Laboratory to explore the feasibility of a small
modular fluoride-salt-cooled high-temperature reactor, or FHR. The goal of the team was to explore
the technology and system architecture trade-space for this new reactor type and to develop a pre-
conceptual design. This document and the design presented here are the products of this effort.
However, the team went beyond simply defining a reactor concept, also proposing an innovative
thermal energy system based on the clustering of multiple small FHR units together with an advanced
energy storage system to deliver benefits not otherwise attainable from reactor units operating
independently.

The fluorine-salt-cooled Small modular Advanced High-Temperature Reactor (SmAHTR) and
energy system concept described in this report are but a first step in making tangible the possibilities
afforded by new technologies, new ways of employing “old” technologies, and new approaches to old
challenges. They provide a tantalizing glimpse at what might be possible should the decision be made
to develop and deploy small modular high-temperature and very-high-temperature reactors.

This preliminary effort has drawn upon the skills and innovative creativity of a team of dedicated
individuals. Reactor systems are complex creations, and reactor system concept development is a
highly iterative, collaborative process that draws on the technical skills, life experiences, intuitive
inspirations, and interpersonal chemistry of the individuals working together. Success depends upon
the team’s ability to collectively exercise “disciplined fearlessness” in questioning the status quo,
while humbly respecting the limits of our knowledge and the collective wisdom of our technical
community. It is my belief the SmAHTR concept development team has achieved a measure of
success in this regard. We look forward to the continuing evolution and improvement of the concept

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Fluoride-salt-cooled high-temperature reactors, or FHRs, are a new class of thermal-spectrum
nuclear reactors defined by their use of liquid-fluoride-salt coolants, together with tri-isotropic
(TRISO)-coated particle fuels and graphite moderator materials. FHRs operate with primary system
pressures near atmospheric pressure and at coolant temperatures in the range of 600°C to ~1000°C.
FHRs combine and leverage technologies and system architectures originally developed for molten
salt reactors, gas-cooled reactors, and liquid-metal-cooled reactors to provide functionalities not
otherwise attainable with traditional reactor concepts.

This report summarizes the results of work conducted at Oak Ridge National Laboratory during
2010 to explore the design space and technology trade issues associated with small modular FHRs.
The small modular FHR concept described in this report, termed SmAHTR for Small modular
Advanced High-Temperature Reactor, builds upon work conducted between 2002 and 2006, during
which time the original large FHR concept, the Advanced High-Temperature Reactor (AHTR), was
developed.

SmAHTR i1s a 125 MW{, integral primary system FHR concept (Figs. ES.1 and ES.2). The design
goals for SmAHTR are to deliver safe, affordable, and reliable high-temperature process heat and
electricity from a small plant that can be easily transported to and assembled at remote sites. The
initial SmAHTR concept is designed to operate with a core outlet temperature of 700°C, but with a
system architecture and overall design approach that can be adapted to much higher temperatures as
higher-temperature structural materials become available. The SmAHTR reactor vessel is
transportable via standard tractor-trailer vehicles to its deployment location (Fig. ES.3). Tables ES.1
and ES.2 provide SmAHTR s principal design and operating parameters.

SmAHTR employs a “two-out-of-three system” philosophy for operational and shutdown decay-
heat removal. Transition from operational power production to shutdown decay-heat removal is
accomplished without active components.

Several fuel and core design options for SmMAHTR were investigated during the design evolution.
These designs included solid cylindrical fuel “pins” in stringer fuel assemblies (which was the
baseline design for the AHTR), hollow annular fuel pins in stringer fuel assemblies, and solid plate or
“plank”-type fuel elements. The most developed and analyzed configuration, and current baseline
design, is based on the annular fuel pin design. However, the plank-type fuel assembly in a “cartridge
core” configuration appears to offer many operational advantages and is being further investigated at
this time. Additional work is needed to arrive at an operational fuel assembly design that
simultaneously accomplishes all of the required functions. A pebble-bed variant is also possible.

The SmMAHTR design takes advantage of the existing safety philosophy of several small modular
reactors. The reactor employs passive decay-heat removal systems relying on natural convection, and
the core 1s designed with large negative reactivity feedback coefficients. The core and all primary
components are contained in the reactor vessel (integral design). This design eliminates the large
break loss-of-coolant accident (LBLLOCA) scenario. Only intermediate-loop piping carrying non-
radioactive coolant penetrates the vessel. The passive decay-heat removal design eliminates the
reliance on off-site power, which is necessary if the reactor is to be sited in remote locations, and the
need for safety-related emergency on-site AC power. The reactor can be seen as having several
barriers to fission product release in the case of an accident: coated particle fuel, the graphite
moderator, the reactor vessel/guard vessel, and the containment.

The SmMAHTR concept has been developed with three potential operating modes and applications
in mind: (1) process heat production, (2) electricity production, and (3) a combined cogeneration
mode in which both electricity and process heat are produced. The capability to cluster multiple
reactors to meet energy demands greater than those which can be met by a single reactor unit is an
important design consideration for small modular reactors. This is certainly the case for any reactor
concept designed for both electricity production and process heat applications. However, numerous
questions and issues arise whenever multiple reactor units are interconnected. Only integration
methods that do not compromise system safety or reliability can be considered. The interconnection
or “ganging” of multiple reactor units to drive shared electrical power conversion systems has been
widely discussed by reactor vendors and advanced concept developers for many years. However, the
matter of the correct approach for clustering multiple small reactor units to meet intermediate-to-large
process heat loads has received much less attention.

The use of an innovative liquid-salt thermal energy storage system, or “salt vault,” notionally
depicted in Fig. ES.4, expands the flexibility and applicability of the SmAHTR reactor for all
applications. The salt vault offers three distinct functionalities: (1) the potential to combine multiple
SmAHTR reactor modules to meet thermal energy and electrical power generation demands much
greater than 125 MWt, (2) a robust capability to buffer the reactors and the process heat load from
transients (such as reactor shutdown or time-varying heat demand) on either side of the salt vault
interface, and (3) the ability to buffer multi-reactor module installations from upsets within a single
reactor.

As a high-temperature system, SmMAHTR is potentially compatible with several highly efficient
(>40% thermal efficiency) power conversion technologies. The most attractive options for power
conversion systems are Rankine and Brayton cycle technologies. One particularly appealing option is
to couple the system to a high-efficiency closed-cycle supercritical carbon dioxide (S-CO,) power
conversion system. S-CO, power conversion is an emerging technology that can potentially provide a
combination of small system components and high operating efficiency even at modest operating
temperatures. Multi-reheat helium Brayton systems are also viable options, though they are less
compact than the supercritical Brayton systems.

Based on work to date, it appears small modular FHRs are technically feasible. Additionally, it
appears small FHRs, such as SmAHTR, would provide siting and applications flexibility unparalleled
by other types of reactors.

Though a detailed SmMAHTR cost and economic analysis cannot yet be performed due to the
relative immaturity of the concept, there are reasons to expect that SmAHTR would be an
economically attractive system from both capital cost and operating cost standpoints. The intrinsic
virtues of FHR systems and technologies (low pressure, high volumetric heat capacity coolant, high-
fuel-temperature thermal margins, etc.), when coupled with the potential for further capital cost
reductions stemming from factory fabrication of small reactor modules, hold much promise.
Significant potential offsetting considerations include the cost of high-temperature nuclear structural
materials and the fabrication techniques required to produce complex components (such as heat
exchangers) from them.

The SmAHTR concept presented here is but a snapshot of a complex technology and system
architecture trade space. SmAHTR and the SmAHTR salt vault thermal energy system described in
this report are not optimized systems. Additional concept definition work to be done includes the
following.

e  Optimization of the fuel and core design
e Further definition of the reactivity and instrumentation and control system
e Expanded transient and safety analyses (including generation of a pre-conceptual phenomena

identification and ranking table, or PIRT, as soon as the concept is sufficiently defined to
enable the exercise)

e (Optimization of the in-vessel primary heat exchanger and direct reactor auxiliary cooling
system heat exchanger designs

e Optimization of the salt vault system design and its interface with the reactors

e optimization of the SmAHTR electrical power conversion system design and the interface
to it
e Preliminary SmAHTR capital cost estimates

Modest investment in these activities will significantly expand our understanding of the
feasibility of the SmAHTR concept, its performance attributes, and its principal development
challenges.

System concept development activities are essential elements of integrated advanced reactor
development programs because it is in the system concept that the value and promise of scientific
research and technology development are made manifest. Concept development activities provide the
basis for prioritizing and guiding both basic technology development and enabling component
development activities. With this in mind, a focused research, technology development, and
component demonstration program is needed to enable FHR and SmAHTR development. A focused
R&D program would include the development and optimization of fluoride-salt coolants, TRISO fuel
forms, salt-compatible structural materials (graphites, composites, metals), critical components
(pumps, heat exchangers, and valves), and high-temperature instrumentation. One insight that stands
out from the work performed to date is the priority that must be placed on the development of
compact salt-to-salt and salt-to-gas heat exchangers. Additional key component development
priorities include liquid salt pumps and the vortex diodes that can tolerate a high-temperature liquid
salt environment. All of these activities are supported by a basic focus on the development of high-
performance, high-temperature nuclear materials, as discussed previously.

ABSTRACT

This report presents the results of a study conducted at Oak Ridge National Laboratory
during 2010 to explore the feasibility of fluoride-salt-cooled small modular high-temperature reactors.
A preliminary reactor system concept, SmMAHTR (for Small modular Advanced High-Temperature
Reactor) 1s described, along with an integrated high-temperature thermal energy storage or “salt
vault” system. The SmAHTR is a 125 MWt, integral primary, liquid-salt-cooled, coated-particle-
fueled, graphite-moderated, low-pressure system operating at 700°C. The system employs passive
decay-heat removal and “two-out-of-three” subsystem redundancy for critical functions. The reactor
vessel is sufficiently small to be transportable on standard commercial tractor-trailer vehicles. Initial
transient analyses indicated the transition from normal reactor operations to passive decay-heat
removal 1s accomplished in a manner that preserves robust safety margins throughout the transient.
Numerous trade studies and trade-space considerations are discussed, along with the resultant initial
system concept. However, the current concept has not yet been optimized, and work remains to more
completely define the overall system—with particular attention given to refining the final fuel/core
configuration, salt vault configuration, and integrated system dynamics and safety behavior.

1. INTRODUCTION

1.1 BACKGROUND

Fluoride-salt high-temperature reactors (FHRs) are characterized by their use of fluoride-salt
coolants together with solid fuel forms. Currently, the preferred FHR fuel form is tri-isotropic
(TRISO)-coated particle graphite fuel similar to that employed in today’s high-temperature gas-
cooled reactors (GCRs). FHRs differ from molten salt reactors (MSRs) in that MSRs employ a fissile-
material-bearing, multicomponent fluid as both a coolant and a fuel. Unlike the MSRs, FHRs contain
no fissile or fertile material in the coolant.

This report presents the initial technology trade study and pre-conceptual design evolution of a
small modular high-temperature reactor system developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. This
Small modular Advanced High-Temperature Reactor (SmAHTR) employs liquid-fluoride-salt
coolant together with TRISO-coated particle fuel technology in an integral primary system
architecture.' These key technologies are joined with an innovative thermal energy storage system
and Brayton power conversion technology to deliver high-temperature (>600°C) process heat and
highly efficient electricity production from a small integral reactor capable of being transported via a
standard tractor-trailer truck to remote destinations for permanent installation.

1.2 REPORT ORGANIZATION

This report provides a description the pre-conceptual design of SmMAHTR and is organized into
12 chapters. Chapter 1 provides background information on early work on fluoride-salt-cooled
reactors and an introduction to the SmMAHTR concept, and Chap. 2 presents the system design
philosophy and functional requirements adopted for the SmAHTR design trade study. Chapter 3
provides a high-level overview of the SmMAHTR concept as an introduction to the more detailed
system descriptions in Chaps. 4 and 5. Chapter 4 describes the primary in-vessel structures, along
with key reactor system mechanical design details, and Chap. 5 discusses the major systems that
interface directly to the reactor vessel. Chapter 6 summarizes very preliminary SmAHTR transient
and safety analysis results, and Chap. 7 presents the salt vault concept, an innovative high-
temperature thermal energy storage system that enables clustering of multiple SmMAHTR reactors to
meet a broad range of high-temperature thermal energy system loads. Candidate electrical power
conversion systems are discussed in Chap. 8, and SmAHTR operational considerations (salt
management, refueling, etc.) are described in Chap. 9. Chapter 10 briefly discusses SmAHTR
economic performance considerations, and Chap. 11 summarizes the principal SmAHTR technology
development challenges. Chapter 12 provides a summary of the report, and Appendices A and B
contain ancillary data and information.

The original U.S. FHR concept, termed the Advanced High-Temperature Reactor (AHTR), was
developed in 2004* * and was subsequently updated in 2006.* The AHTR embodied the basic
elements of the FHR and was targeted for large (GWe-class) central station electricity production.
Unlike the AHTR, the SmAHTR concept presented in this report is targeted for deployment in remote
locations, where smaller amounts of power/energy are needed, for situations in which additional
power/energy capacity is needed in an incremental manner rather than all at once, or where cooling
water constraints preclude large GW-class nuclear power plants.

This report documents the initial concept evolution of SmMAHTR. As will be discussed, several
significant technology and system architecture design trades are yet to be performed, and several
SmAHTR design variants are evident. Thus, the current SmMAHTR concept is best considered to be a
tool for exploring the small fluoride-salt high-temperature reactor design space, rather than as an
optimized system concept. The details of the concept will, no doubt, evolve as various technology
trade and system optimization studies are completed.

2. SmAHTR SYSTEM APPLICATIONS, DESIGN GOALS,
AND FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

2.1 NUCLEAR PROCESS HEAT REQUIREMENTS AND POTENTIAL SmAHTR
SYSTEM APPLICATIONS

The SmMAHTR concept described in this report is being designed to be a system capable of
providing reliable, economically attractive electricity and process heat. The potential value of such a
system improves significantly as the reactor outlet temperature rises above 600°C but requires that
fundamental material challenges above this temperature be addressed. In terms of electricity
production, thermal-to-electric power conversion efficiencies increase from the mid-thirty percent
range at light-water-reactor operating temperatures (~300°C) to the mid-fifty percent range as reactor
operating temperatures rise to 750°C—with still higher efficiencies as operating temperatures rise
above this level.

With regard to process heat applications, numerous petrochemical refining processes require
high-quality heat in the 600-700°C range.' Small reactor systems operating in the 750°C range would
be well suited for remote production of high-pressure steam to enable petroleum extraction from oil
sands.” Hydrogen production via high-temperature electrolysis and steam—methane reforming
becomes practical at temperatures in the 800-850°C range (and is currently produced via natural gas
combustion).” The attainment of reactor core outlet temperatures of 900—1000°C would enable a
variety of thermal chemical processes for the production of hydrogen from water, gasification of hard
coal and lignite, etc.’ Thus, the development of a reliable, economical, and flexible reactor system
capable of delivering heat at 600-1000°C would revolutionize highly efficient electrical power
production and the production of liquid fuels for transportation and other applications.

Finally, the power level (MWt or MWe) required from an individual reactor unit can be
determined by several factors. The broad range of industrial process heat applications presents a
variety of process heat loads. Typical heat loads are in the range of ~100 to few hundred MWt. (An
example of a forward-looking nuclear process heat application is presented in Ref. 4, where it is
concluded the optimal size reactor for powering future biorefineries would be on the order of
~100 MWt.) On the other hand, until recently the trend in reactor sizing for electricity production has
focused on larger and larger reactors. The largest reactors currently envisioned by reactor vendors are
on the order of ~1.7 GWe. This growth in unit size has been driven by classical “economy of scale”
considerations based on traditional plant manufacturing and construction techniques. More recently,
interest has grown in the use of “small modular reactors” (SMRs), with power levels in the ~50—

200 MWe range. This interest is driven by a multitude of factors including the very large unit capital
cost of the larger plants, the desire to meet smaller electricity demand market needs, the ability to
match generation capacity growth more closely with load growth, and the expectation that factory
fabrication of larger numbers of smaller reactor units will deliver economies of production that offset
the traditional “economy of scale” considerations.

2.2 SmAHTR DESIGN GOALS AND DESIGN TRADE SPACE ATTRIBUTES

The design goals for SmMAHTR are to deliver safe, affordable, and reliable high-temperature
process heat and electricity in a small plant that can be easily transported to and assembled at
remote sites.

A design deemed to be unsafe by regulatory bodies will not be certified and, therefore, will never
come to market. A plant that is not affordable from the unit capital cost perspective will not be
purchased and will never achieve significant market penetration. A plant that is not reliable and does
not offer very high levels of unit operational availability will not present favorable long-term value to
its owner and is destined for a short operating lifetime. Reactor system designs (and their companion

2-1
fuel cycles) that exhibit unacceptable proliferation vulnerability will not be supported by the U.S.
government. Therefore, the SmMAHTR design goals also include the delivery of acceptable levels of
safety, affordability and economic viability from both the plant capital cost and electricity/process
heat cost perspectives, and favorable nonproliferation characteristics.

The ability to deliver the desired system performance attributes and functionalities discussed
above requires the designer to make numerous decisions relating to the selection and integration of a
large number of technologies, structures, components, and architectures. The primary design trade-
space variables considered to date in the SmAHTR development activity include the following.

e reactor power level

e reactor operating temperature

e gsystem architecture (integral primary system vs. classical distributed loop system)

e core architecture (cartridge core vs. individual fuel assemblies vs. pebble fuel)

e safety system actuation mode (active vs. passive)

e coolant

e power conversion system technology

e manner of fabrication and deployment (on-site vs. factory produced and truck transported)

The details of some of the more important trade analyses conducted to date are presented in
Chap. 3.

2.3 SmAHTR FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

After consideration of the work previously conducted on the original AHTR concept, and in view
of challenges faced by those seeking to develop and deploy any radical reactor technology that is
significantly different from today’s commercial light water reactors, the following principal
SmAHTR functional requirements were adopted to guide the initial concept evolution activities.

1. Reactor power level: 125 MWt

2. Maximum operational fuel temperature: 1250°C

3. Reactor core outlet temperature: 700°C

4. Passive decay-heat removal capacity: 1% of full power

5. Reactor vessel and internals transportable via standard 53 ft commercial tractor-trailer
vehicles

6. Thermal-to-electric power conversion efficiency: >40%

7. System architecture and technology suite that can be adapted to higher temperatures

Requirements 14 are related to the technical performance of the reactor subsystem. The
125 MWt size ensures a single SmMAHTR module could support a number of different process heat
applications, and the cluster of a few SmAHTR modules could support the majority of high-
temperature and very-high-temperature-process heat applications envisioned well into this century.
Requirement 2 ensures there should be no unacceptable release of radioactive fission products from
the SmMAHTR fuel during normal operations. Requirement 3 ensures that the early SmAHTR systems
should be able to utilize Hastelloy-N structure materials in the core and reduces the probably that new
structural alloy development will be an obstacle to development of the SmAHTR prototype. The
passive decay-heat removal requirement (Requirement 4) establishes both the size of the decay-heat
removal systems and sets requirements for SmMAHTR system transient behavior during any event
leading to reactor scram or shutdown.

Requirement 5 ensures the SmMAHTR reactor vessel and internals can be delivered to virtually any
location within North America. Use of the U.S. interstate highway system is governed by U.S.
Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations. These regulations stipulate that transport vehicles

2-2
shall not exceed 2.6 m (102 in.) in width, 4.1 m (13.5 ft) in height, and 36,000 kg (80,000 1b) in gross
weight. However, these regulations may be temporarily suspended by individual states to allow
movement of oversize and/or overweight payloads, and variances are routinely granted by states
throughout the country. Thus, an optimal SmMAHTR reactor vessel would not exceed these
dimensional and mass parameters.

Requirement 6 applies to the overall SmAHTR electrical energy system and has the effect of
requiring the SmMAHTR reactor to be joined to a Brayton power conversion system for electricity
supply applications.

Requirement 7 acknowledges that SmAHTR is but the first step in a long-term goal to deliver
very-high-temperature nuclear energy to the world. This goal is best served by adopting evolvable
design approaches, system architectures, and wherever possible, technology suites that have the
potential to function at temperatures as high as 800—1,000°C for applications later in this century as
technical barriers are overcome.

3. SmAHTR SYSTEM CONCEPT OVERVIEW

SmAHTR is a small liquid-fluoride-salt-cooled, very-high-temperature reactor that employs an
integral primary system concept in which all major components required to interface the reactor with
the rest of plant are placed inside a single reactor vessel. Figure 3.1 is a depiction of a SmAHTR
reactor vessel in transient on a standard commercial flat-bed tractor-trailer rig. Figure 3.2 provides an
overall schematic of the SmAHTR system, and Fig. 3.3 shows the dimensions of the vessel and
internals. Table 3.1 summarizes the key SmAHTR system parameters, and Table 3.2 summarizes the
thermal hydraulic parameters of the SmAHTR.

SmAHTR employs three in-vessel primary heat exchangers (PHXs). Each PHX is coupled with a
main circulating pump (MCP) that directs primary coolant salt from the common riser region above
the reactor core down through the shell side of the PHX into a common downcomer region located
between the outside of the core reflector and the inside of the reactor vessel. The coolant flows down
through the downcomer annulus region to the lower head region of the reactor vessel and then up
through the core and back to the common riser region, thus completing the main circulating loop.
Each of these in-vessel cooling loops is termed a main circulating loop (MCL).

The secondary (tube) side of each PHX 1is an integral element of a companion intermediate
cooling loop (ICL). Each ICL consists of the secondary side of the PHX, a companion intermediate
loop pump (ILLP), and an intermediate heat exchanger (IHX) that transfers the heat to the ultimate load
(either the electrical power conversion system or the process heat storage system and load). During
normal operations, all three MCLs and ICLs are active, each removing one-third of the heat produced
by the reactor. This is accomplished by adjusting the in-vessel MCP flow and the companion ILP in
each of the three ICLs. SmAHTR can operate at full power with only two of the MCL/ICL. loops
operational by simply increasing the MCP/ILP flow in the two operational cooling trains.

SmAHTR can be employed in three different energy production modes: (1) electricity production
only, (2) process heat production only, or (3) cogeneration mode (both electricity and process heat
production). If dedicated electricity production is the objective, the secondary side of the SmAHTR

primary heat exchangers could be connected directly to the Brayton power conversion system heat
exchangers to provide a very compact electricity production power block. Alternatively, if process
heat production is the intended application, the secondary side of each primary heat exchanger would
most likely be connected via its ICL to an IHX. The working fluid in this intermediate loop would be
fluoride salt with thermal properties to match the application temperatures. Each IHX would, in turn,
transfer the thermal energy either directly to the process heat load or to a thermal energy storage
device. As will be discussed later in this report, the use of a common thermal energy storage device,
coupled with multiple SmAHTR units, offers many operational advantages. A thermal energy storage
tank, termed a salt vault, is envisioned here and discussed in Sect. 7. Multiple SmAHTR units could
be clustered together to thermally “pump” or “charge” the salt vault to meet higher thermal energy
loads, provide robust load following capability, decouple the thermal energy load from the reactors
when desirable, and provide a degree of decoupling between the individual SmAHTR units.
SmAHTR employs three passive direct reactor auxiliary cooling system (DRACS) cooling loops
to remove post-scram shutdown decay heat from the reactor. Only two of the three loops are required
for safe operations. During normal operations, reverse flow of reactor coolant through the in-vessel’s
DRACS heat exchangers (DHXs) is reduced to the minimum necessary to keep the DRACS loop at
working temperature by the use of a passive vortex diode at the outlets of the shell side of each of the

3-5
in-vessel DHXs. The vortex diode restricts (“reverses”) flow of reactor coolant through the DHX (and
the associated parasitic heat loses through the DRACS systems) during normal operation. Upon trip
of the MCPs, natural convection is established within both the reactor vessel and within the DRACS
loop. Within the reactor vessel, reactor coolant flows up through the core and down (forward) through
the primary (shell) side of the DHXs, thus removing the decay heat produced by the reactor. Within
the DRACS system, the DRACS working fluid (an optimized fluoride salt) is heated within the DHX
and flows up to its DRACS air radiator in an external structure, where the fluid 1s cooled by dumping
its heat load to air in an induced-draft natural convection chimney structure.

4. SmAHTR NUCLEAR ISLAND STRUCTURES AND REACTOR
MECHANICAL DESIGN

4.1 FLUORIDE SALT SELECTION

The SmMAHTR reactor has three distinct working fluid loops: (1) the reactor primary loop, (2) the
intermediate cooling loop (ICL), and (3) the DRACS decay-heat-removal loop. Additional working
fluids are necessary for both the electricity generation and heat storage configuration options. The
additional working fluids and their selection criteria are discussed in the Brayton power cycle and salt
storage sections of this report. An evaluation of potential FHR primary coolant salts is available as an
ORNL report.' Similarly, an evaluation of potential heat transport salts was recently performed.” The
information summarized here is derived primarily from the more detailed assessments.

4.1.1 Primary Coolant Salt Selection

In an FHR, the primary coolant serves several interrelated functions. The coolant’s primary
function is to move heat generated in the fuel and transfer it to the PHXs, but it also provides neutron
moderation, serves as a radionuclide containment, and provides gamma shielding. Therefore, the
coolant salt selection must consider the salt’s thermal, nuclear, and chemical properties.

The primary coolant must have a melting point well below the coldest point in the primary
circuit. For the SmAHTR, the primary coolant melt point must be below ~550°C, providing 100°C of
margin to any refreezing accident. The primary coolant must also be thermally stable well above any
credible accident conditions. The primary coolant vapor pressure must remain below 1 atmosphere in
all temperature regimes anticipated to occur in any credible accidents. Similarly, the primary coolant
must have a boiling point well above any credible accident condition temperatures. In addition, to
function as an effective coolant, the primary fluid must have a low viscosity at operating temperature
and have a large heat capacity. Finally, the primary coolant needs to have a large change in specific
volume with temperature to effectively drive natural circulation cooling.

From a neutronics perspective, while the majority of the neutron moderation is provided by the
in-core carbon structures, the light elements in the primary coolant provide significant neutron
moderation. Removing the coolant from the core will change the core reactivity due to the change of
the neutron spectrum resulting from the loss of neutron moderation as well as the lost of absorbing
materials. In order to ensure that coolant loss or voiding does not result in reactivity excursions
resulting in loss of fuel, it is desirable to design the system to be in an under-moderated configuration
such that the loss of the moderating coolant results in a negative reactivity. Note that in addition to the
coolant reactivity, the uranium-based fuel has a large negative fuel temperature coefficient, so any
potential increases in temperature due to loss of coolant will also result in a large negative reactivity
effect from the fuel.

The primary coolant should have a low neutron-absorption cross section or become unstable
under intense radiation. The requirement to have a low neutron-absorption cross section eliminates
most isotopes from consideration. Fluoride salts are among the most stable compounds in radiation
fields due to their strong ionic bonding and the resultant rapid chemical recomposition following
radiolysis. In-service inspection and fuel manipulation would be simplified by a low-activity primary
coolant. Further, having a large volume of highly radioactive fluid would increase the containment
building structural requirements. Both zirconium and rubidium have significant activation products
with multiday half-lives and energetic associated gamma rays greatly increasing the operational
difficulty of employing either in the primary coolant. Similarly, sodium activates to **Na (Ty; = 15 hr)
and emits energetic gamma rays during decay.

The elements in the primary coolant need to be chemically compatible with the core and primary
loop materials. Both bismuth and lead fluorides are eliminated from consideration due to their

4-1
corrosive nature with available alloys. Also, boron-11 fluorides are not useful due to the toxicity of
BF;, the high vapor pressure of BF; at accident temperatures, the tendency of BF; to separate from
the remainder of the salt and locally raising the melting point, and BF;’s strong tendency to rapidly
oxidize in the presence of trace amounts of water vapor.

Only lithium-7 beryllium fluorides meet all the requirements for the SmAHTR primary coolant.
Pure beryllium fluoride has too high a viscosity at SmMAHTR operating temperatures. The 2:1 "LiF to
BeF,; ratio (known as FLiBe) is selected as the SmAHTR primary coolant to provide a low melting
temperature while minimizing the melt viscosity.

Tritium is produced by several reactions when using FLiBe as a primary coolant: °Li(n,0)t,
*Be(n,0)°Li — °Li(n,a)z, 'Li(n,an)t, and F(n,"’0)t. The Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR) design
estimate was that at a 99.995% 'Li purity in the primary coolant, roughly 1 Ci of tritium would be
produced per day per megawatt (thermal) of reactor size.” For comparison, a large light water reactor
(LWR) produces ~50 Ci/day, and a typical heavy water reactor (HWR) produces 3,500-6,000 Ci/day.
The largest fraction of the tritium produced will become a dissolved species in the primary salt. Most
of the remainder will be trapped in the nearby core graphite. However, tritium will rapidly permeate
through metals at high temperatures. Consequently, the tritium will need to be removed from the
primary and secondary salts through a combination of chemical and physical degassing. Also, a cool
tritium container shell surrounding the hot system components will likely be necessary.

While the lithium fluoride will require special production, the beryllium fluoride is anticipated to
be available from commercial sources, although quality improvements may be necessary to meet
purity requirements. The SmMAHTR primary coolant salt will be expected to meet the Molten Salt
Reactor Experiment (MSRE) minimum impurity levels, which are shown in Ref. 4, and were based
on minimizing nuclear poisons and on analyses of samples of the best commercially available
fluoride salts at that time. The coolant salts will be synthesized by first purifying the component salts
to remove water and oxygen by heating under vacuum. Next the correct ratios of the constituent
fluoride salts will be combined and melted. The resultant salt will then be processed to remove bound
oxygen and water, sulfur, and metal ions by sparging with mixtures of hydrogen fluoride and
hydrogen. Associated with the chemistry control process will be vacuum, hydrogen fluoride, helium,
and hydrogen supply systems. The SmAHTR chemical control system will also mechanically filter
the salt to remove any entrained particulates such as graphite dust using a nickel filter.

4.1.2 Fluoride-Salt Corrosion Chemistry

As discussed previously, SmAHTR will employ FLiBe as its primary coolant and either FLiNaK
or KF-ZrF, as its intermediate and DRACS coolants. Corrosion of structural metals in liquid-fluoride-
salt systems typically begins with oxidation of a structural constituent metal atom to an ion in
solution. Thermodynamic stability of the alloy constituents versus fluoride salt constituents is, thus,
quite important to minimize this corrosion mechanism. For example, chromium, which has one of the
more thermodynamically stable fluorides, can react with available oxidants in the system. Chemically
available fluorine atoms typically arise due to electronegative impurities within the otherwise strongly
ionically bound fluoride melt. In other words, because of the strong chemical bonding of alkali metal
and beryllium fluorides, the corrosion potential of liquid fluoride salts is generally controlled by
redox equilibria involving impurities in the liquid salt or gas phase above the liquid salt.

Temperature differences within a single thermal loop cause gradients in the chemical activities of
the loop constituents and can result in dissolution of metal in one region of the system with
subsequent deposition in other portions of the system. The degree of attack will depend on the
thermodynamic driving force of the reaction, the dissolution and deposition kinetics, and the
temperature distribution, as well as the loop hydraulic properties. Essentially, the saturation
concentration of the corrosion product fluoride depends upon its temperature, resulting in deposition
of the corroded species in the cooler regions of a loop.

4-2
The presence of spatially distributed, dissimilar structural materials within the same system can
also lead to mass transfer even at isothermal conditions. Two conditions are required for dissimilar
material-based concentration-gradient mass transfer to be a factor. First, an element contained in one
of the materials has to have a strong tendency to form an alloy or compound with an element in the
second material. More importantly, an element in one of the materials must be subject to oxidative
attack or suffer dissolution within the salt solution. The oxidative attack can be either by reaction with
impurities or, if a reactive element, with the salt constituents. In either event, once the element goes
into solution, it will be carried along with the coolant and form a solid product if the chemical driving
force 1s sufficient. As the solid product forms, the concentration of the dissolved species within the
fluoride salt melt decreases, enabling the corrosive attack or dissolution to continue. Solid-state
diffusion kinetics may limit the rate at which this corrosion mechanism occurs. Further, if the attack,
via any of the corrosion mechanisms, is mediated by reaction with impurities, the corrosion may
inherently dramatically slow with time as the impurities are consumed.

SmAHTR corrosion will be minimized both by using high-purity starting materials as well as
actively managing the salt chemical state. The salt redox condition, and thus its corrosivity, will be
affected by impurities in the salt and impurity ingress from the atmosphere and the container
materials. In addition to initially removing impurities from the salt before use, the electrochemical
potential of the salt will be adjusted on-line to compensate for changes during operation. The essence
of redox control in a liquid fluoride salt is minimization of the non-strongly bound fluoride by
providing plentiful, energetically preferential reaction sites within the melt for any less strongly
bound fluorine that develops. In other words, the redox potential of the salt is kept highly reducing to
prevent oxidation of the container by fluorine atoms. Methods for redox control include setting the
ratio of two different oxidation states of a particular multivalent element within the salt such as
Ce(II1)/Ce(1V).” The multivalent element initially reacts with the salt to become a fluoride and is then
reduced within the salt by contacting it with a non-blocking electrode maintained at a negative
voltage. The redox condition of a fluoride salt is also impacted by the chemical structure of the
particular salt. Some fluoride salts (e.g., BeF,), referred to as Lewis acids, can accept pairs of
electrons, forming a weak complex (BeF,”). This method of corrosion control will be implemented at
SmAHTR by allowing the primary coolant FLiBe to corrode metallic beryllium, much as was done in
the MSRE secondary loop, both providing an excess of an electropositive element as well as a Lewis
acid to complex fluoride ions.

A continuous flowing cover gas will be employed over the primary salt in the reactor vessel. This
cover gas will act as the transport medium to move tritium (which will be produced via neutron
transmutation of the salt) and ingress gases (especially oxygen and moisture) away from the liquid
salt coolants to cleanup systems. Helium will be employed as the cover gas, and either somewhat less
pure helium or dry nitrogen will be employed within containment. Argon is avoided as a cover gas to
minimize the production of *' Ar during reactor operation. Some oxygen will unavoidably be present
in containment and will leak into the gas volume above the coolant salt. A small amount of oxygen
contacting the salt surface is not a high consequence issue. While oxygen contacting the salt surface
will dissolve into the salt and need to be removed by the salt chemistry control system to maintain the
salt redox condition, fluoride salts do not have energetic reactions with oxygen. Note that trittum will
diffuse through the reactor vessel at temperature, and thus the tritium collection system will be
required to envelop the entire reactor vessel and intermediate piping. While the addition of hydrogen
to the cover gas would aid in maintaining a low oxidation potential above the salt, hydrogen cannot
be readily separated from tritium and hence will not be employed.

4.2 REACTOR VESSEL AND VESSEL CLOSURE
The SmMAHTR reactor vessel is a free-hanging cylindrical vessel with an integral annular flange at

the top which is supported by the surrounding reinforced concrete structure. The reactor vessel will be
made from Hastelloy-N, which has a maximum allowable stress of 3.5 ksi at 704°C.° Calculations

4-3
based on the hydrostatic loading of the vessel, and its weight under static condition, result in a
maximum stress on the vessel with a thickness of 2.5 cm to be 1.4 ksi, which i1s well below the 3.5 ksi
value that already includes most of the factor of safety in arriving at the number (see Fig. 4.1 showing
the vessel and the stress distribution).

ORNL 2011-G00116/chj

 

Fig. 4.1. (a) Reactor vessel and (b) reactor vessel stress distribution under load.

The reactor vessel is attached to the external load-bearing concrete structure by support brackets
that allow for lateral motion that may occur during operation, installation, or removal.” By using
Lubrite plate and an interstitial gap between the anchoring bolts that attach the reactor vessel and
concrete, small lateral motion can be accommodated without transmitting large forces. Similar design
1s incorporated on the bolts that make the vertical support connection. The reactor will be designed to
account for operational basis earthquake at the deployment site.

The overall reactor design philosophy is to make the design as modular as possible. All
components of the reactor are introduced from the top (Fig. 4.2). The IHX and DRACS heat
exchangers, the reactor core, the reflector, and the control rods have flanged entry points at the top of
the reactor. This series of flanges in three concentric circles interlock to form the top closure of the
reactor vessel. An outermost top closure flange rests on top of the reactor vessel flange which, in turn,
rests on the supporting reinforced concrete pad (Figs. 4.2 and 4.3).

This top closure flange supports the weight of all the reactor vessel internals and transfers this
load to the surrounding reactor vessel flange. The core reflector, the PHXs, the DRACS heat
exchangers, and the downcomer “skirt” that constitutes the inner boundary of the annular downcomer
are all suspended directly from this closure flange. The central closure plate or “core bonnet” supports
the reactor core and transfers the resulting load to the top closure flange. The control rods are inserted
through this central closure plate but have the ability to be raised or lowered independently of the
central plate.

SmAHTR employs uranium oxicarbide (UCQO), tri-isotropic (TRISO) particle fuel that closely
resembles that being developed and demonstrated by the Department of Energy Office of Nuclear
Energy (DOE NE) advanced gas reactor program.® TRISO fuel has an extensive reactor pedigree’ and
remains the only high-temperature fuel form with near-term availability for nuclear power
deployment. In TRISO particle fuel, the fuel material (in this case UCy 50, 5) 1s in the form of small
spheres that are sequentially overcoated with a series of protective layers. The particles are embedded
within a graphitic material to form fuel compacts. Unlike in GCRs, where the compacts are embedded
within graphite structures (to provide conduction cooldown under loss of forced flow conditions),

4-5
FHR fuel compacts are placed into direct contact with the coolant to maximize their heat transfer
under both forced and natural convection cooling conditions.

The peak TRISO temperature during normal operation is limited to 1,250°C for the current
SmAHTR design evolution. This temperature matches the irradiation temperature of the current
advanced gas reactor fuel-testing program.'’ Moreover the compact power density of the Advanced
Gas Reactor-1 (AGR-1) test program (=30-130 W/cm®) bounds the SMAHTR fueled region power
density.

The focus and depth of analysis for the three different fuel forms have not been uniform. The
cylindrical fuel form was evaluated first. While a neutronically and thermally acceptable core form
was developed, the cylindrical compacts have two technical difficulties. First, the long cylindrical
fuel form would be difficult to fabricate and, second, technically challenging to robustly mount while
preserving the thermal coupling to the coolant. In an FHR, a primary fuel configuration metric is the
distance between the fuel particles and the coolant, as this heat conduction distance strongly
influences the fuel operating temperature. Any external mechanical mounting structure would
increase this distance and thus increase the fuel operating temperature.

An annular fuel concept was next investigated as a means to improve the thermal coupling
between the fuel and coolant. The annular fuel form also enables the use of a central carbon—carbon
composite mounting rod to hold shorter fuel segments. The annular fuel form decreases the fuel peak
operating temperature as compared to the cylindrical form. Also, the shorter annular fuel pieces are
suitable for manufacturing using known methods. However, a central tie rod is by itself insufficient to
prevent the individual fuel compacts from moving as the coolant is pumped through the core.
Movement of individual fuel compacts due to flow-induced vibration, along with potential physical
interaction with other core structures, would be deleterious to fuel lifetime.

In order to provide strong mechanical mounting of the fuel, a plate or “plank”™ fuel form was next
considered. The plank fuel form represents an evolution of the graphite moderator structure originally
proposed for the MSR."' In this case, the fuel is embedded within vertically oriented planks
configured into hexagonal fuel bundles that are directly emplaced within the coolant.

The plank mechanical fuel configuration appears to be superior to either the cylindrical or annular
fuel forms. However, the hydraulic, thermal, and neutronic core models for the plank fuel form were
not as advanced as with the earlier fuel forms at the conclusion of this project, and the predicted core
lifetime and peak fuel temperatures remained shorter and higher, respectively, than those for the
annular fuel form at the end of the evaluation effort. Additional design and modeling of the plank fuel
design would be required before it could be recommended as the baseline core configuration.

The remainder of this section presents the results of the analysis conducted to date for each of the
three fuel forms discussed. As previously noted, though a pebble-bed fuel/core form is clearly a
candidate for SmAHTR applications, time and resource constraints precluded analysis of the pebble-
bed core variant in this initial design evolution exercise.

4.3.2 Solid Cylindrical Fuel Option

The cylindrical fuel core consists of stacked prismatic blocks containing stringer fuel bundles. In
the cylindrical fuel option, the TRISO particles are uniformly loaded at a 50% volumetric packing
density into fuel cylinders. The TRISO UCO fuel kernels are 500 microns in diameter. A total of
1,556.4 kg of uranium (19.75 wt % **U) is loaded into the core. The stringer fuel bundles design is
derived from the stringer fuel assemblies considered during 2006 for the AHTR'"* and are horizontally
surrounded by hexagonal graphite blocks. The hexagonal graphite blocks and fuel cylinders are both
80 cm 1n height. The dimensions of the cylindrical fuel variant of the SmMAHTR core are provided in
Table 4.1. The graphite blocks are 45 cm across the flats. Each fuel block contains 72 fuel pins and
19 graphite pins. Figure 4.4 shows a cross section of a single fuel block.

The evaluation of the lifespan of the SmAHTR core was performed using the Monte Carlo
three-dimensional TRITON depletion sequence in SCALEG, the configuration controlled version of
SCALE, which includes the latest updates.

The core model predicts an excess reactivity of (kg— 1)/k. = 26,940 pcm for the fresh core. The
core power density is 9.379 MW/m’. The depletion was performed at constant power, using smaller
time steps at the beginning of the simulation and increasing the magnitude of these steps as the
depletion progresses. The depletion calculations were carried out for a total of 60 time steps, covering
a span of ~4.5 years. The core becomes subcritical after 3.52 years.

The temperature coefficients of reactivity for the fresh core were estimated from the variation of
kg over the temperature interval (1,100-1,500°C). A temperature coefficient of reactivity is defined

4.3.3 Annular Cylindrical Fuel Option

The annular SmMAHTR core resembles the cylindrical fuel core in overall geometry using the
same 80 cm tall hexagonal fuel blocks stacked five high. In the annular fuel SmAHTR core variant,
the fuel is configured into annular compacts roughly 5 cm high that are strung along a carbon—carbon
composite vertical tie rod. The fuel compact beads have inner and outer 3 mm thick graphite sleeves
to protect the fueled bead interior from erosion. A total of 1,806.7 kg of uranium (19.75 wt % **U) is
loaded into the core with a 50% volumetric packing fraction. The overall annular fuel compact
geometry is illustrated in Fig 4.7, and an annular fuel bundle is shown as Fig. 4.8.

A cross section view of an annular fuel bundle within its graphite channel is shown as Fig. 4.9.
The graphite channels of the annular fuel variant are identical to those for the cylindrical fuel variant.
Thus the overall core cross section is quite similar between the two design variants. The annular fuel
core variant was calculated to become subcritical after 4.19 years.

The dimensions of the annular fuel bundle components are provided in Table 4.3.

4.3.4 Plank Fuel Option

In the plank-fuel SmMAHTR core design variant, the fuel is configured into full core height planks
that are mounted mto a carbon—carbon composite frame. The top and bottom 15 cm of the planks are
unfueled and are notched to accommodate a retention band. Each fuel plate has unfueled wear ridges
running along its length to provide positive mechanical spacing and thereby prevent flow-induced
vibration. Several different plank-fuel configuration variants were analyzed by changing the number
and thickness of the planks as well as their fuel loadings. A representative fuel plank bundle is shown
as Fig. 4.10. The plank fuel bundles also are 45 cm across the flats, so they are geometrically similar
to the fuel channels of the alternate core designs. A cross section of a plank fuel bundle is shown as
Fig. 4.11.

Control rods were incorporated into the plank fuel core. Six rods were located within the middle
ring of fuel bundles, as shown in the core cross section i Fig. 4.12. The different coloring of the
plank fuel bundles in Fig. 4.12 are intended to illustrate the three rings of fuel bundles that constitute
the core. The fuel bundles, however, are identical except for the control rods within the middle ring.
Control rod position 1s adjusted from the top of the reactor.

The longest core lifetime achieved with the plank fuel to date was 3.08 years with a 40%
volumetric fuel packing fraction and using identical UCO TRISO kernels as with the annular and
cylindrical core variants. A total of 2015.4 kg of uranium (19.75 wt % “U) is loaded into the core.

Fuel is uniformly loaded within the planks, and each plank has a 2 mm unfueled sleeve
surrounding it to protect against erosion. Each third of a neutronically optimized fuel bundle consists
of six planks. Every other plank is fueled, so each one-third bundle section consists of three fueled
planks and three graphite planks. The coolant channel spacing between planks is 6.8 mm.
Geometrical information for the six-plank fuel bundles is provided in Table 4.5.

The fuel planks themselves are not load-bearing members. The fuel bundles are supported from
below by a lower support honeycomb structure made from carbon—carbon composite that mimics the
“Y” structure of the individual fuel bundles. A similar honeycomb structure is also employed at the
top of the core to provide lateral positioning of the fuel assemblies. SiIC—SiC composite rods from the
top honeycomb connect the fuel assembly to the core bonnet. A SiC-S1C composite sheath connects
the bottom and the top honeycomb structure. The core geometry is shown in Fig. 4.13. In this manner,
the fuel assemblies rest on the bottom honeycomb, which is connected to an outer sheath that is, in
turn, suspended from the top honeycomb structure. This top honeycomb has support rods that connect
it to the removable core bonnet and transfer the load of the core to the core bonnet.

4.3.5 Fuel Assembly Thermal Performance

As discussed in Sect. 2, SmAHTR Functional Requirement 2 mandates that the peak fuel
temperature anywhere in the core will not exceed 1250°C during normal operations, while
Requirement 3 limits the peak core outlet coolant temperature for normal operations to 700°C. The
three fuel assembly concepts discussed previously were analyzed to evaluate their respective
performance with regard to these two key requirements.

All of the fixed fuel SMAHTR core mechanical configurations were analyzed in steady state
using RELAP5-3D. Table 4.6 shows some thermal hydraulic results for the three different fuels
analyzed with different flow conditions. The central conclusion of the analysis is that with reasonable
variance in the coolant flow through the core (900-1,400 kg/s) any of the fuel configurations
evaluated will perform adequately in terms of both maximum fuel temperature and maximum coolant
outlet temperature. The neutronic and structural core design constraints are more limiting than the
steady-state thermal and hydraulic configurations. In general, minimizing the distance that heat must
be conducted through the fuel to its surface is the primary fuel thermal design optimization parameter
to minimize the fuel peak temperature.

Bypass flow could be mixed with the core outlet flow above the core, enabling a somewhat
higher power output while maintaining the average coolant temperature below 700°C at all locations
where it impacts metal structures.

44 REFLECTOR AND DOWNCOMER SKIRT

The reactor core has a radial graphite reflector as part of the neutronics design to thermalize and
return neutrons to the fueled section of the core as well as to reduce the neutron fluence rate in the
vessel. Because of the core’s aspect ratio and the fact that the salt itself can serve as a reflector, no
axial reflectors are contained in the current design, which results in a shorter overall vessel height. As
discussed in Sect. 4.2, each PHX and DRACS heat exchanger is supported individually by the reactor
closure flange. The heat exchangers receive the hot coolant discharging from the top of the reactor
core while pumping the cold coolant down the annular space between the reflector and the reactor
vessel. To separate the outlet coolant flow from the heat exchangers and the coolant at the top of the
reactor, a “downcomer skirt” is designed to channel the flow (Fig. 4.14). The skirt is attached from
the top of the reflector between the support rods up to the top of the heat exchangers. Although there
may be small gaps that may not fully isolate the cold and hot coolant, for the most part, mixing of the
coolant is avoided by this design.

5.1 INTRODUCTION

In addition to the reactor vessel and its internal structures, the principal systems comprising the
SmAHTR nuclear island are the

e intermediate heat transport system (including the in-vessel PHXs),

e direct reactor auxiliary cooling system (including the in-vessel DRACS heat exchangers),
e instrumentation and control system, and the

e reactivity control system.

These systems are described in this chapter.

5.2 INTERMEDIATE HEAT TRANSPORT SYSTEM
5.2.1 Intermediate-Cooling-Loop Overview

SmAHTR utilizes three PHXs coupled to FLiBe CREEENEO DO

The PHXSs are located at the top of the
vessel, inside the annulus formed by the
downcomer skirt and the inner surface of the
reactor vessel. The pumps are located at the top
of the PHXs, and each PHX has a corresponding k
pump. Figures 5.2 and 5.3 show the location of 4/
the PHXs. Each PHX alternates with each DHX. ( )

The three PHXs and the three DHXs occupy the
complete annular space between the core barrel
skirt and the vessel.

Each PHX (Fig. 5.4) is designed to remove
50% of the total reactor power (62.5 MW), so
that only two heat exchangers are required to
remove 100% reactor power. This is the design
philosophy of “two-out-of-three,” with
redundancy of one component. During normal k
operation, all three loops with the three PHXs </

for the annular pin fuel), with either three or two
pumps in operation. The core flow is also the
same with either two or three pumps in
operation.

5.2.2 Intermediate-Cooling-Loop Salt
Selection

The secondary coolant transports the
reactor’s heat from the PHX to a secondary heat
exchanger (SHX). As such, the secondary salt
evaluation criteria are almost entirely heat
transport performance based. Only fluorides are
candidates for SmAHTR secondary coolant since
the primary coolant salt on the other side of the
PHX is a fluoride salt. Having a different
chemical system (such as a chloride) on one side
of the heat exchanger and a fluoride on the other
would require employing an alloy compatible
with two different chemical systems at
temperature. A proven alloy that is compatible
with chloride and fluoride salt is not currently
available.

The secondary coolant does not have a
nuclear performance requirement, thus
expanding the salt options. The secondary coolant salt needs to have a melting point below ~500°C to
minimize the potential for freeze-up events. The boiling point for the secondary salt must be above
SmAHTR’s core outlet temperature to maintain low pressure. Similarly, the vapor pressure of each of
the salt components must remain below 1 atmosphere at operating conditions and preferably much
lower to avoid depleting the salt in any species. The secondary coolant must also be thermally stable
above any credible accident conditions. In addition, the secondary fluid must have a low viscosity at
operating temperature and a large heat capacity. The secondary salt needs to be chemically
compatible with the secondary loop structural alloy. For ease of operations, the secondary salt also
should not be highly toxic.

Lighter low-Z salts (salts containing elements with low atomic number) tend to exhibit better
heat-transfer performance metrics. However, almost all of the fluoride salts exhibit good heat-
transport performance. Further, all of the candidate heat-transfer fluoride salts have similar corrosive
properties when contaminated, and thus structural alloy compatibility is not a primary discriminator
among candidate fluoride salts.

With respect to heat-transfer performance, the FLiNaK (46.5-11.5-42 mol % and 454°C melting
point) eutectic is superior to all identified fluoride salts and for this reason has been selected as the
SmAHTR secondary coolant salt. The leading alternative intermediate heat-transfer salt is KF-ZrF,
(43-57 mol %) due to its acceptable heat transfer performance and lower melting point (430°C). One
issue for the use of FLiNaK containing non-enriched lithium in the secondary loop is the potential for
a leakage into the primary system. A principal part of the cost of the primary salt is for the removal of
lithium-6. If a major leak from the secondary salt to the primary salt develops, the lithium isotopes
will mix and require significant expense to reseparate. Thus, the secondary loop should not be at a
significantly higher pressure than the primary system.

5.2.3 Primary Heat Exchangers and Pumps

The PHX (Fig. 5.4 and Table 5.1) is shell-and-tube, countercurrent flow design, with the primary
fluid (FLiBe) circulating in the shell and the secondary fluid (FLiNaK) circulating inside the tubes.

The tubes are arranged horizontally, with four horizontal passes. Each pass consists of
354 tubes—the total number of tubes for the four passes is 1,416 tubes. There are 12 tubes per row,
with a total of 114 rows. The total height of the HX is 2 m, which is the height of the annulus. The
tube OD is 25.4 mm, and the wall is 1.6 mm thick. Tube pitch is 1.2. All the material in contact with
the salt is Hastelloy-N. Welding and joining technologies for Hastelloy-N heat exchangers were
developed for the MSRE project. A rendering of a single PHX and pump system is shown in Fig. 5.4.
The secondary coolant, FLiNaK, is supplied to the bottom of the PHX through a down tube located at
the left of the figure. Baffles are incorporated in each tube header to provide the appropriate number
of tube passes. The secondary flow exits at the right side of the heat exchanger. An axial flow pump,
located at the top of the PHX, provides forced-down flow on the primary side of the heat exchanger,
drawing hot coolant from the upper plenum of the reactor and forcing coolant through the PHX. An
overhung impeller allows the motor to be located outside of the reactor vessel and the pump bearings
to operate in the cover gas at the top of the vessel. A rotating dry gas seal is used on the pump shaft
between the cover gas and atmosphere.

The primary mass flow rate is 525 kg/s of FLiBe entering at the top (with only two PHXs
operating and cylindrical pin fuel configuration) at a temperature of 700°C. The primary coolant
leaves the PHX at the bottom at 650°C. The secondary coolant, FLiNaK, flows at a rate of 370 kg/s,
entering at the bottom at a cold temperature of 600°C and leaving at the top at a hot temperature of
690°C. When three PHXs and three main circulating pumps are operating, the primary coolant flow is
350 kg/s and the secondary flow 1s 247 kg/s. Each PHX will be transferring ~42 MW of power.

5.3 DIRECT REACTOR AUXILIARY COOLING SYSTEM (DRACS) HEAT
EXCHANGER AND LOOP

5.3.1 Overall DRACS Architecture

SmAHTR employs three DRACS loops in a two-out-of-three design approach; the core decay
heat is designed to be removed with only two of the three DRACS loops operating.

Figure 5.5 is a simplified schematic of the DRACS cooling system. Table 5.2 shows the design
parameters of the DRACS system. Each DRACS loop has been designed to remove 0.42 MW (0.33%
of the total core thermal power) passively (by natural convection). Thus, the three DRACS will
remove 1.26 MW, which is ~1% of the total core full power. Each DRACS loop removes decay heat
passively to an outside natural draft air cooler that includes a 12 m high chimney (one cooler for each
DRACS). The air coolers are located outside and elevated with respect to the reactor vessel in order
to promote natural convection in the DRACS loop. Figure 5.6 shows the DRACS loop with the
reactor vessel and the air cooler and tower. Dampers incorporated in the chimney inlet are used to
control airflow to the finned air heat exchangers that are located inside the chimney. Figure 5.7 shows
a closer view of the air cooler and how it is designed to operate.

5.3.2 DRACS Salt Selection

Each DRACS loop has a heat exchanger (DHX) located inside the vessel annulus in contact with
the primary coolant; the DRACS air radiator (DAR) is in contact with the outside cooling air. The
DHX is a single-pass, shell-and-tube design, and the air heat exchanger (AHX) is a single-pass finned
tube design. The salt selected for the coolant inside the tubes (the DRACS loop) is FLiNaK. This salt
may not be the best choice as the coolant in this loop should have the lowest melting point in order to
prevent salt freezing inside the loop, in particular at the air cooler. Therefore, a different coolant salt
may be selected in the future. However, the salt selection for concept development purposes is
sufficient to perform an initial design and assessment of the performance of DRACS. The material in
contact with the salt is Hastelloy-N. The location of the DHXs inside the vessel is shown in Fig. 5.2.

The DRACS transfers heat from the primary coolant to ambient air via the in-vessel DHX and the
external DAR. The requirements for the DRACS coolant are nearly identical to those for the
secondary coolant with the exception of placing a higher value on a lower melting point to minimize
the potential for salt freeze-up. Either FLiNaK or KF-ZrF, (43—-57 mol % and a 430°C melting point)
would be suitable salts for use in the DHX, with the FLiNaK providing somewhat improved heat-
transfer performance and the KF-ZrF, providing a lower melting point while avoiding the possibility
of diluting the primary salt lithium enrichment. KF-ZrF, is not currently in the REL AP code package.
For this reason, FLiNaK was selected as the baseline coolant for the DRACS loop.

KF-ZrF, could also be employed in the secondary loop at an intermediate pressure between the
power cycle and the power cycle loop. A pressurized intermediate loop would reduce the stress across
the SHX, easing its design and fabrication. Further design trade studies will be required to evaluate
which option would be preferred.

5.3.3 DRACS In-Vessel Heat Exchanger and Loop

The DHX is located inside the vessel annulus and is a single-pass, shell-and-tube cross flow heat
exchanger. The secondary fluid (FLiNaK) flows inside the tubes, and the primary coolant (FLiBe)
flows outside the tubes. The primary coolant flows downward during natural convection conditions
(pumps off). During full-power operation, with the main pumps running, the primary coolant flow in
the DHX is upward because of the pressure differential across the pump inlet and PHX. This flow
results in a parasitic heat load on the system as any heat lost through the DRACS during normal
operation is an overall system thermal loss, and results in less heat delivered to the intermediate loop.
A vortex diode at the bottom of the DHX limits the amount of this upward flow. A vortex diode acts
much like a leaky check valve; however, it has no moving parts. It has a high pressure drop in one
direction (reverse) and a low pressure drop in the forward direction. Upward flow in the DHX
during normal, pumped operation causes reverse flow in the diode, which reduces the total flow
through the core.

The DHX consists of 664 vertical tubes, 2 m long (height), 1.27 ¢cm (0.5 in.) OD, 1.021 cm ID,
with a triangular pitch of P/D = 1.25. The AHX is located 6 m above the DHX (located inside the
vessel annulus). The DRACS loop connecting both DHXs is 16 m long, consisting of two 6 m
vertical runs and two 2 m horizontal runs. Total height of the DRACS loop is 8 m, including the 2 m
high DHXSs, one inside the vessel and the other inside the cooling tower, and the 6 m high vertical
pipe. The horizontal pipe between both DHXs is 2 m, but other lengths may be required. Thus, one
DRACS hot leg is 8 m vertically and 2 m horizontally with similar dimensions for the cold leg.

A rendering of the DHX is shown in Fig. 5.8. The design is similar to that of the PHX. Figure 5.8
shows horizontal tubes—the tube orientation could be either vertical or horizontal. As with the PHX,
the secondary coolant, FLiNakK, is supplied to the bottom of the DHX through a down tube located at
the right of the figure. The secondary flow exits at the left side of the DHX. For the DHX, the top of
the heat exchanger is completely open to primary coolant flow. However, as discussed previously, a

5-9
ORNL 2011-G00136/chj

vortex diode is located at the bottom of the heat
exchanger to reduce reverse flow during normal
operation. In this case, a vortex-type diode is included in
the design.

5.3.4 Vortex Diode

The design of a vortex diode creates a vortex to
increase the flow resistance in one direction. An example
of the vortex diode is shown in Fig. 5.9. It is designed so
that flow in the forward direction enters at the center of
the device and exits at the tangential port (the diagram on
the right of Fig. 5.9). In the reverse direction, flow enters
the tangential port, induces a swirling flow in the diode,
and then exits at the center port (diagram on the left of
Fig. 5.9), increasing the pressure drop significantly over
that in the forward direction.

Detailed parameters of the vortex diode, located at the
base of each DHX inside the vessel, are not well known
and can vary widely depending on the specific design, in
particular the pressure drop in each direction and the
diodicity. The diodicity of a vortex diode is defined as the
ratio of the reverse-flow pressure drop (in the upward
direction for the SmAHTR DRACS configuration—this is
the large pressure drop) to the forward-direction pressure drop (natural convection pressure drop in
the downward direction—this is the small pressure drop) for the same flow rate. Diodicity values of
400, 50, and 10 have been employed in RELLAP5-3D and calculations to parametrically study the
effect of different diodicity values. Form losses of £ =1 in the natural convection direction were used
for the three cases. The form losses in the reverse direction were: & = 400, &k = 50, and k = 10, to
achieve the desired diodicities of 400, 50, and 10. The larger the value of diodicity, the smaller the
calculated bypass or reverse up-flow. The smaller the bypass flow, the smaller the heat losses through
the DRACS during normal operation at full power. In the RELAP5-3D model, the diodicity does not
affect the DRACS natural convection flow because the natural convection flow form losses (k= 1)
are the same for the three values of diodicity. Table 5.3 shows calculated bypass flow (or reverse
flow), pump-flow/bypass-flow ratio, or P/B (the pump flow is always 350 kg/s), and heat losses for
the three different diodicities used in these calculations. Both flow losses (bypass flows) and heat
losses appear to be acceptable for the three diodicity values, with a DRACS power penalty of slightly
over | MW during normal power operation. Additionally, dampers would be included in the air

cooler design that would limit airflow to the DHX. This was not accounted for in these calculations
but would reduce thermal losses even further.

During DRACS passive operation, the calculated natural convection flow is ~9 kg/s/DRACS.
A value of the diodicity of 50 appears to be reasonable, based on available experimental data. Some
calculations, like the loss of forced flow transient, employed a diodicity of 400.

5.3.5 DRACS Air Radiator

The DRACS air radiator or DAR (Fig. 5.7) inside the air cooler structure is also a single-pass,
tube-and-shell, countercurrent flow device. The air circulates outside the tubes, upward, and the
FLiNaK coolant inside the tubes, downward. The DAR consists of 56 vertical tubes with fins, 2 m
long (height), 2.0 cm OD, and 1.66 cm ID. The air-cooled tower is 12 m in height, with a horizontal
cross-sectional area of 4 m” for the airflow.

During decay-heat operation, three natural convection loops are interconnected for each DRACS:
one inside the vessel primary system with FLiBe as the circulating fluid; another inside the DRACS
loop with FLiNaK as the circulating fluid; and finally, the third loop inside the air cooler with air as
the circulating fluid.

Typical natural convection flows expected during decay-heat operation in the DRACS system are
9 kg/s/DRACS of FLiBe through the primary side of the DHX inside the vessel, 7 kg/s of FLiNaK
inside the DRACS loop, and 2.4 kg/s of air (or nitrogen) inside the air cooler.

54 INSTRUMENTATION AND CONTROL SYSTEM
54.1 Control System Overview

Functionally the instrumentation and controls for SmMAHTR closely resemble those for any
nuclear power plant, with temperature, pressure, flow, level, and neutron flux being the principal
process variables monitored. SmMAHTR’s distinctive coolant, materials, temperature, and fuel,
however, alter both the implementation of the process monitoring as well as key features of the
control philosophy. The higher coolant operating temperature prevents direct use of almost any
LWR instrumentation. Additionally, the conditionally corrosive nature of the fluoride salt coolant
necessitates regular coolant chemistry monitoring.

Under normal operating conditions, the primary information transferred from the power or heat
cycle to the nuclear plant control system is the heat demand. While SmAHTR is naturally load
following due to its strong negative fuel temperature feedback coefficient, receiving a load request
signal enables a more rapid nuclear plant response that minimizes temperature temporal variances
and thereby decreases stress on the plant equipment. An erroneous load demand signal would result
in increased stress on the plant equipment as the reactor inherent thermal feedback adjusts to the
actual load.

The robust nature of the fuel, large fuel negative temperature feedback, and very large margin to
coolant boiling, combined with the tolerance of the primary pressure boundary alloy for short-term
temperature excursions, shifts the plant control focus from the core to the SHX. The SHX is the only

5-11
plant component that experiences both high temperatures and a large pressure differential along with
having a functional requirement to minimize the internal wall thickness.

To minimize its size and cost, the SHX will operate near the design limits of its materials.
Provided that proper chemistry control is maintained, the high-temperature effects on its structural
alloys and joints will determine the lifetime of the SHX. The material creep (and thermal ratcheting)
would be significantly accelerated by temperature excursions above the design limit while at
operating differential pressure. Further, rapidly changing the temperature distribution within the SHX,
as could occur with rapid flow or inlet temperature shifts, would result in excessively stressing the
SHX internal structures, as its materials expand and contract. Thus a primary operational control
objective would be to minimize the thermal excursions and resultant stresses on the SHX.

SmAHTR’s control system design only exists at a primitive level. Knowledge of the core
temperature feedback coefficient and the general stability of liquid-cooled reactor systems, however,
provide confidence that a robust control system can be developed as a specific design emerges. The
operational control systems available to SmAHTR are the direct reactivity control elements (rods or
drums) and the heat removal system. A particular challenge for the detailed control design is that
supercritical carbon dioxide power cycles, an attractive power cycle for use with SmAHTR, do not
currently exist at industrial scales (beyond 1 MW); thus, their loop control technology has yet to be
developed or demonstrated.

The overall reactor control system design intent is that during power operation the mean coolant
core output temperature will be held constant at 700°C. Reactivity would be varied to maintain the
constant temperature. Large power shifts would be accommodated using control element motion with
smaller shifts performed by altering the coolant inlet temperature through flow control. Flow control
technologies such as salt throttle valves or a heat exchanger bypass system, while conceptually
achievable with current materials, have not been designed or demonstrated for FHRs. Alternatively,
flow control could most directly be implemented by altering the pumping speed. Each of the three
SmAHTR primary pumps will have a FLiBe flow capacity of 525 kg/s. A crude estimate of pump
shaft power required to support this flow rate would be up to 200 kW combined shaft power for the
three pumps. While variable speed motors in the 50-100 kW range are commercially available,
variable speed primary pumps have not been previously used for nuclear power plants due to the low
reliability of the required high-power control electronics. Over the past few decades, high-power
solid-state electronics have undergone great improvements in their availability and reliability and
might now be considered the preferred flow control methodology.

5.4.2 Process and Condition Measurement Instrumentation
54.2.1 Temperature

Temperature measurement is indicative of both process conditions and is a primary component of
the energy transfer measurements necessary for efficient power plant operation. Thermocouples are
the most common transducer for process temperature measurement. However, base metal
thermocouples typically lack the long-term accuracy necessary for the heat balance measurements
necessary for efficient process operation. Precious metal thermocouples are a possible alternative that
may provide more accurate temperature measurements.

Type N (Nicrosil-Nisil) thermocouples were developed in the 1970s and 1980s as a lower drift
alternative to other base metal (particularly Type K) thermocouples and may prove to be a suitable
temperature measurement alternative.”* Having achieved designation as a standard thermocouple type
by the Instrument Society of America in 1983, Type N thermocouples have been in widespread use
for more than 25 years. The Nicrosil and Nisil alloys contained in Type N thermocouples were
developed after the instability mechanisms of other base-metal thermocouples were understood,
specifically to overcome these instabilities. Nicrosil and Nisil alloy compositions feature increased
component solute concentrations (chromium and silicon) in the nickel base to transition from internal

5-12
to surface modes of oxidation and include solutes (silicon and magnesium), which preferentially
oxidize to form oxygen diffusion barriers.’

54.2.2 Flow

Liquid-salt-flow measurement will most likely be performed using either external, ultrasonic
flowmeters or Venturi-type flowmeters that use differential pressure gauges as their active element.
Ultrasonic flowmeters are currently gaining wide acceptance in LWRs as a primary coolant
flowmeter due to their low uncertainty and high stability. SmAHTR’s higher temperature requires the
use of mechanical standoffs to limit the ultrasonic transducer temperature exposure. The mechanical
standoffs required for high-temperature application are only becoming available, requiring additional
design and development for confident application. The electronics for water and salt ultrasonic
flowmeters would be essentially identical. The differential pressure gauges required for Venturi base
flow measurement either require diaphragm deflection measurement tolerant of SmMAHTR
temperatures or impulse line interconnection between a high-temperature and a low-temperature
diaphragm, which would be instrumented with conventional low-temperature diaphragm deflection
technology. The impulse line fluid would be a lower melting point fluid such as a liquid metal. Both
optically and capacitively based diaphragm deflection measurements are strong candidates for direct,
high-temperature implementation. Specialized molten salt melt-compatible, diaphragm-deflection
pressure gauges employing NaK (78% potassium, 22% sodium) impulse line isolation of the high-
temperature diaphragm are becoming available.

5.4.2.3 Level

Several technologies are available for salt level measurement. Bubbler-type level measurements
based upon the pressure required for minimal flow in a vertical tube are commercially available
technology. Also, radar-type level measurements based upon reflection off the top surface of the salt
are commercially available. The radar gun and electronics would be located in a standpipe above the
fluid well outside of the high-temperature and high-radiation zones. Mechanical float-type level
measurements can also be readily adapted to the salt loop by attaching a mechanical extension to a
float on the surface of the salt. The mechanical extension would be configured such that it would
extend into a nonmetallic standpipe above the vessel, enabling the position of the end of the
mechanical extension to be determined magnetically. Heated lance-type level measurements within a
salt-compatible sheath would also provide discrete position level measurement.”

5424 Flux

High-sensitivity, high-temperature-tolerant neutron flux monitoring is necessary during the initial
reactor approach to critical. The reflector and thick downcomer make monitoring the subcritical
neutron flux outside the vessel impractical; thus, a high-sensitivity neutron detector is necessary in or
near core during startup. Fission chambers are commercially available with temperature tolerances to
~550°C. An operational approach would thus be to achieve initial criticality with a salt temperature
less than 550°C and to withdraw the startup detector before bringing the reactor to operating
temperature. As requiring lower-temperature criticality 1s operationally limiting, development of
higher-temperature flux monitoring is recommended.

Power-range neutron flux monitoring serves as an indication of unintended reactivity insertion as
well as provides a cross check of the thermal measurement of reactor power. During power operation,
the neutron flux is sufficiently large to make neutron flux measurements outside the reactor vessel
using high sensitivity detectors. However, moving the flux measurements outside the core decreases
the measurement fidelity in that the core interior flux will be spatially masked.

5-13
Local power-range monitors are used to provide an indication of the spatial flux distribution.
Gamma thermometers are structurally similar to thermocouples and are thus anticipated to perform at
FHR temperatures. While gamma thermometers have existed in some form since the 1950s’ and
indeed were approved by the U.S. Nuclear Regulator Commission (NRC) for local power
measurement in pressurized water reactors (PWRs) in 1982, gamma thermometers are only now
beginning to emerge in widespread use in commercial nuclear power plants. Gamma thermometers
function based upon the heating of the sensor assembly by gamma rays and the subsequent controlled
differential cooling of the sensor body. The temperature differential developed along the cooling path
1s proportional to the rate of heating by the incident gamma rays, which is in turn proportional to the
local power-generation rate during power-range operation.

5.4.2.5 Salt chemistry

Maintaining the relatively low corrosivity of fluoride salts is critically dependent on controlling
the reduction—oxidation state. The most readily oxidized component of Hastelloy-N is chromium.
Monitoring the decay gamma rays from chromium activation within the primary coolant would
provide an indication of chromium dissolution into the salt. The instrumentation required to
characterize the detailed chemical state of fluoride salt exists as laboratory-type instrumentation and
is not readily available in an industrial application. Electrochemical measurements are the standard
technique for monitoring the redox condition of salt components. Optical absorption spectroscopy is
also a potentially useful methodology for identifying trace chemical constituents and their valence
state.® Optical access to the salt is most readily provided through a standpipe above the salt containing
an inert gas bubble; a noble metal mirror within the salt would provide the optical return path.

5.5 REACTIVITY CONTROL SYSTEM

The SmMAHTR Reactivity Control System (RCS) provides the capability to maintain control of
the nuclear reactivity of the system during normal and off-normal operations. The RCS was not
developed for SmAHTR, so several considerations must be taken into accout in its design. In a typical
RCS, reactivity is controlled by a combination of fixed burnable absorbers, control rods (movable
absorbers), and an inherent negative temperature feedback coefficient. Control rods are used during
operation to offset reactivity changes from fuel burnup, fission product production (transient, such as
xenon, and long term), and temperature variation during startup, operation, and shutdown. Burnable
absorbers can also be used, and likely will be required, to control the large initial excess reactivity
that exists in the SmMAHTR single-batch long-life core. This section provides a discussion of the
requirements for the RCS and proposed concepts for normal and off-normal operation.

5.5.1 RCS Purpose

The purpose of the RCS is allow for reactor reactivity control during normal operations, such as
startup, steady state operation, changes in operating power and reactor shutdown, as well as off-
normal operations requiring the ability to shutdown the reactor. The primary design requirements of
the RCS have not been fully developed, but based on operational considerations and a review of the
general design criteria (GDC) in 10 CFR 50 Appendix A for safety considerations, the following
functional requirements have been developed.

1. Ensure that the reactor can be reliably shutdown and held in a safe shutdown configuration
with the core in its most reactive state (e.g., cold configuration, no xenon).

2. Two physically diverse shutdown mechanisms must be provided to ensure that the reactor can
be shutdown should one system fail.

5-14
3. The control system must be able to control reactivity during operation to account for fuel
burnup, temperature feedback, and transient fission products (e.g., xenon).

5.5.2 Burnable Absorbers

The operational control of the reactor involves the startup, ascension to power, steady state
operation, and orderly shutdown of the reactor system. This implies that sufficient reactivity control
must be available to account for the temperature reactivity defect (cold-to-hot), changes of reactivity
during operation (primarily due to fuel burnup and fission product poisons), and shutdown of the
reactor. The need to change power in response to loads may also be required.

The strategy for controlling reactivity for SmMAHTR is similar to other reactors in which the
overall excess core reactivity (~27,000 pcm, as indicated in Sect. 4.3) is largely offset through the use
of fixed burnable absorbers. Startup, changes in power level, and shutdown are generally
accomplished through control rod movements, although the possibility of the use of reactivity
feedback may allow variations in flow to change the temperature and therefore provide a means to
adjust power.

Therefore, the use of fixed burnable absorbers will be used to manage the majority of the
reactivity swing over the fuel cycle, which, as indicated above, is large given that the entire core is
replaced. The goal in the design of the burnable absorber configuration, in terms of selection the
burnable absorber type and amount, is to minimize the amount of excess reactivity that must be
managed by the control rods, thereby minimizing the number of control rods and their reactivity
worth. Common burnable absorbers for high-temperature reactors include boron carbide (possibly
enriched in boron-10), gadolinium oxide and carbide, and erbium oxide and carbide. Combinations of
these absorbers have been found to be effective in provide a means of controlling reactivity over time,
with boron carbide as a thermal neutron absorber burning out relatively quickly and gadolinium and
erbium as resonance-region absorbers burning out over a longer period of time. The boron carbide
can be mixed directly with the graphite matrix, while gadolinium and erbium can consist of coated
particles. Note, however, that if the absorbers do not fully burn out during the operation period, as
the case may be with erbium, they will represent a reactivity penalty at end of life and shorten the
overall fuel cycle length. In addition to providing reactivity control, burnable absorbers can also be
used to provide power shaping, which may be useful in SmAHTR to flatten the radial and axial
power profiles.

5.5.3 Operation Control Rods

Operation control rods will be required to adjust reactivity during startup and shutdown and to
control transient reactivity changes not offset by burnable absorbers, such as responding to transient
fission products, such as xenon-135. Safety shutdown (reactor scram) is not the primary function of
these control rods, but they can be designed to drop into the core upon loss of power or other scram
actuation. The specific number of controls and their absorber loading will be determined during the
core design process to ensure that they are capable of managing the full reactivity swing from cold to
hot and for buildup and decay of xenon-135. Additionally, the maximum worth of the control rod
must be less than $1 of reactivity to ensure that a prompt critical excursion will not occur if the
control rod 1s accidently withdrawn (control rod ejection, as it exists in LWRs, is not possible in low-
pressure systems, such as SmAHTR, but uncontrolled withdrawal of the control rod cannot be ruled
out). A typical design value would be less than $0.50. A control rod design based on that of the Gas-
Turbine Modular Helium Reactor (GT-MHR) or Next-Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) can be
adopted in which the control rod material is boron carbide (possible enriched) dispersed in graphite
and clad with carbon—carbon composite materials. The control rod channels can also be formed with
carbon—carbon composites, or the control must be design to be mechanically flexible to move
thorough possibly offset channels resulting from graphite geometrical changes during operation. The

5-15
control rod drive motors can include magnetic release mechanisms as needed and springs or
compressed nitrogen as can be used as a driving force to offset buoyancy in the liquid salt.

An additional means for operation control is the use of the inherently negative temperature
reactivity feedback of the system. As shown in Table 4.4, the coolant reactivity coefficient is negative
and therefore allows the possibility to effect reactivity changes through changes in the coolant
temperature. This could occur passively by changes in the reactor load affecting heat removal from
the reactor through the PHX or could occur directly by changes in the MCP speed resulting in
changes in coolant flow (Sect. 5.4.1) and, therefore, changes in coolant temperature. Hence, the
possibility of load-following operation and flow-based control exists but has not been investigated.

5.54 Reactor Shutdown System

A reserve shutdown system is necessary to provide a redundant system in addition to the
operational reactivity control system. In SmAHTR, additional control rods, similar to other
operational control rods, will be employed as a reserve shutdown system. These control rods are fully
withdrawn during operation and are only allowed to release upon a loss of power or scram signal.
Like the operational control rods, magnetic latches will be employed along with springs or
compressed nitrogen gas to insert the control rods against the buoyancy forces of the salt.

The use of control drums in the reflector, as an alternative to rods, can also be considered. The
drums are designed to have a portion of their surface with neutron absorbers that can be rotated
towards the core to shut down the reactor, which in this case will result by basically blocking the
reflector. The use of control drums minimize the above-core structures that are required but will
require drive shafts that extend through the PHX, DHX region down to the reflector region.

Overall, the operational and reserve shutdown system must maintain the core in a fully subcritical
configuration in the core’s most reactive state, which is typically cold and xenon free at beginning of
life, but may actually occur during the cycle if burnable absorbers are used. Further, it is typically
assumed that the control rod of the highest worth 1s not inserted in the core. The amount of reactivity
considered for the shutdown margin must include uncertainties associated with the prediction of the
core reactivity, operational variations, and manufacturing tolerance.

5.5.5 Secondary Shutdown System

The GDC requires a physically diverse secondary shutdown system that operates on different
design principles from the primary reactivity control system to ensure that the reactor can be maintain
in a long-term shutdown mode. Several options that can be used for this secondary shutdown system,
as briefly described.

Buoyancy driven control rods—the driving force of the control rods can be based on their
buoyancy in the liquid salt, providing a fully passive shutdown mechanism in the event of loss of
flow.

Absorber injection system—a strongly absorbing chemical can be injected into the coolant to
provide shutdown of the reactor system. Several chemical options can be considered, but a primary
concern is removal of the absorber from the expensive coolant salt. This would require a coolant salt
chemical cleanup system that may be more substantial than that required for salt chemistry. Rather
than inject the poison, a potentially passive means is to have a solid absorber in the core region that
melts as the coolant reaches a certain temperature.

Absorber balls or pellets—a typical secondary shutdown system proposed for GT-MHR 1is the
use of absorber balls or pellets that can be dropped in to the core. In the case of a liquid-salt system,
these either need to have a higher density than the salt, be dropped into voided channels, or allowed to
float up from the bottom of the core.

Expansion modules—another common passive reactivity control system, typically considered in
fast reactors, is gas expansion modules or lithium expansion modules in which an absorber material

5-16
inserted in a tube within the core is compressed into a region above the core by the flow of the reactor
coolant. Should the coolant stop flowing, the absorbtion expands into the core region, providing a
means for shutdown.

6. SmAHTR SYSTEM SAFETY AND TRANSIENT BEHAVIOR

6.1 SAFETY/LICENSING PHILOSOPHY

The SmMAHTR design takes advantage of the existing safety philosophy of several small modular
reactors (SMRs).! The reactor uses passive decay-heat removal systems relying on natural
convection, and the core is designed with large negative reactivity feedback coefficients. The core
and all primary components are contained in the reactor vessel (integral design), which eliminates the
possibility of a large break loss-of-coolant accident (LBLOCA) scenario. Only intermediate loop
piping (ILP) carrying nonradioactive coolant penetrates the vessel. The passive decay-heat removal
design eliminates reliance on off-site power, which is necessary if the reactor is to be sited in remote
locations, and removes the need for safety-related emergency on-site AC power. The reactor can be
viewed as having several barriers to fission product release in case of an accident, these being the
coated particle fuel, the graphite moderator, the reactor vessel/guard vessel and the containment.

In addition to these barriers, the design has other safety features. The reactor will use
TRISO-coated particle fuel, which not only acts as a fission product barrier but also has a failure
point (>1,600°C). The use of molten salt coolant with a high boiling point and low vapor pressure
allows near-ambient operating pressure. The good heat transport properties of the molten salt result in
slow response to upset events without the need for active cooling systems. In addition, the molten salt
coolant is transparent and chemically inert, allowing for easier refueling and in-service inspection.’
SmAHTR uses seismic isolation to reduce the seismic fragility of the design. Below-grade
construction reduces the vulnerability to aircraft impacts. The design will use risk-informed
approaches to determine the level of defense in depth needed in the design to accommodate for
uncertainties.’

These inherent safety design features combined with a small source term should lead to a reduced
emergency preparedness zone, which would allow the reactor to be sited near other facilities that may
need process heat, electricity, or both. Interfaces between the reactor and other facilities that may
share the site will need to be accounted for in the safety analysis. Being a unique, first-of-a-kind
system, sufficient data to support the safety case for SmMAHTR will be necessary and will be obtained
through a test program supported by detailed safety analysis. Many of the issues related to the use of a
high-temperature molten salt coolant can be address through non-nuclear separate effects test
programs in which component and thermal hydraulic tests with molten salt and/or simulant fluids are
conducted. The data necessary to support the fuel qualification program can make use of data
obtained by the NGNP program.

The passive decay-heat removal systems will need to be thoroughly analyzed, tested, and
monitored or inspected to ensure they will meet the performance goals over the lifetime of the plant.
Materials will be selected for compatibility with the high-temperature molten salt operation and for
resistance to radiation damage.® Because the molten salt coolant has a relatively high melting point,
special attention will be given to overcooling events which may cause coolant solidification to occur
in some portions of the primary or intermediate coolant systems. A set of nuclear critical experiments
will probably be necessary to quantify the reactivity feedback mechanisms. Because SmAHTR i1s a
first-of-a-kind small reactor with limited source terms, it could be licensed as a prototype reactor,’
allowing confirmatory data to be collected during operation of the first reactor.

As part of the conceptual design, a set of safety design criteria unique to SmMAHTR will be
developed that will be used in lieu of the “General Design Criteria” contained in 10 CFR 50
Appendix A to guide the design of the reactor. A probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) will be
developed to determine the licensing bases events and classify the systems, structures, and
components (SSC) as to their safety significance.’ A phenomena identification and ranking table
(PIRT) will be developed to assist in the event identification and SSC classification.

6.2 TRANSIENT BEHAVIOR
6.2.1 Introduction

The SmMAHTR accident envelope can be defined by five types of transient conditions: transient
over-power, loss of flow, loss of coolant inventory, overcooling, and loss of heat sink. These
accidents are similar to those defined for a liquid-metal reactor (LMR) because the SmMAHTR and the
LMR have similar characteristics, mainly a coolant with high boiling point along with good heat
transfer characteristics and low-pressure operating conditions. Given the similarities between a
SmAHTR and LMR, it is likely that the design basis events will be defined by these five transients
with scram. The Anticipated Transients without Scram (ATWS) will be considered beyond design
basis events as agreed to by the regulators during the review of the Clinch River Breeder Reactor and
the PRISM and Sodium Advanced Fast Reactor (SAFR) reactors.” In addition to the reactor transient
accidents mentioned above, other accidents such as those that might occur during refueling and those
generated from external events (seismic, fire, flood, and high winds) will be addressed as part of the
design basis envelope. Time and resource constraints associated with this study have not permitted
analyses of the five transient classes noted above; however, a preliminary analysis of the loss-of-flow
transient has been completed and is discussed below.

6.2.2 Loss of Forced Flow with Scram

A loss of forced flow with scram was analyzed to determine whether the DRACS system as
designed could remove the decay heat during a loss-of-flow event. This transient was performed
based on the following assumptions.

(a) The reactor is initially at full-power operation (125 MWt) with the three pumps operating at
full flow (350 kg/s/pump for cylindrical pin fuel).

(b) The transient is initiated at 500 s, when the power to the three pumps is lost, the pumps’ coast
downtime is 30 s, and the pumps’ flow is reduced linearly to zero flow in 30 s.

(c¢) The reactor control system scrams the reactor; the reactor power is reduced to decay-heat
levels in 4 s.

(d) Stringer (cylindrical pin) fuel was used in the core in this calculation.

(e) Only two of the three DRACS are operational, following the safety philosophy.

(f) The diodicity of the vortex valve 1s 400.

Calculations performed with the RELAPS5-3D® code are presented in the following figures.
Figure 6.1 shows the coolant flow through the core, which is reduced from the initial value of
1,018 kg/s (steady-state forced convection with the three pumps on) to a natural convection core flow
of 24 kg/s. The natural convection flow consists of the flows through each of the two operational
DRACS at 9 kg/s each plus the flow through the nonoperational DRACS at 6 kg/s. Figure 6.2 shows
the flow through the core and through the DRACS after the transient is initiated.

Figure 6.3 shows the primary coolant flow through each of the DRACS during the complete
transient. Before the transient is started, the flow through each DRACS is negative with a value of
—10.5 kg/s. After the transient is initiated and natural convection is established, each operational
DRACS has a flow of 9 kg/s while the nonoperational DRACS has a flow of 6 kg/s.

Figure 6.4 shows the natural convection flows calculated inside the DRACS loop and inside the
air cooler (tower). The flow in the DRACS loop i1s 7 kg/s of FLiNaK, and in the air cooler it is
2.4 kg/s of nitrogen. (RELAPS does not have the capability of using air as a fluid; however, it does
have the capability of using nitrogen. Nitrogen was therefore used instead of air in these calculations.)

6.3 SEISMIC SAFETY DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

Seismic isolation will be used to reduce the seismic vulnerability of the plant. Seismic isolation
systems have not been used in current GEN 11+ designs but are expected to be reviewed by the
regulator as part of the licensing process for some integral pressurized water reactors (IPWRs) and
L.MRs. Testing, analysis, and inspection requirements that arise as a result of these regulatory reviews
will be directly applicable to SmAHTR, and the results of these reviews will be incorporated into the
SmAHTR design as appropriate.

The below-grade design of SmMAHTR, compared to current GEN III+ reactors, will require
changes in the approach taken for seismic design of the reactor. The fact that several SMRs are
expected to be located below grade will allow SmAHTR to take advantage of lessons learned during
the regulatory review of these designs.

In addition to the below-grade seismic design and isolation issues, the effect of groundwater and
hydrodynamic pressures associated with varying water tables will need to be considered in the design
of below-grade reactors such as SmAHTR. As in the case of seismic design, lessons learned
associated with the effects of water table variations and hydrodynamic pressure during licensing
reviews of below-grade iPWRs and LMRs will be directly applicable to SmAHTR.

SYSTEM: THE “SALT VAULT”

7.1 INTRODUCTION

As noted previously, the SmMAHTR concept has been developed with three potential operating
modes and applications in mind: (1) process heat production, (2) electricity production, and (3) a
combined cogeneration mode in which both electricity and process heat are produced. Chapter 4 of
this report described the SmMAHTR nuclear island structures and systems. This section introduces an
innovative high-temperature thermal energy storage system intended to significantly extend the utility
and range of potential process heat applications for multi-reactor SmMAHTR 1nstallations.

The capability to cluster multiple reactors to meet energy demands greater than what could be
met by a single reactor unit is an important design consideration for SMRs. This is certainly the case
for any reactor concept designed for both electricity production and process heat applications.
However, numerous questions and issues arise whenever multiple reactor units are interconnected.
Only integration methods that do not compromise system safety or reliability can be considered. The
interconnection or “ganging” of multiple reactor units to drive shared electrical power conversion
systems has been widely discussed by reactor vendors and advanced concept developers for many
years. However, the correct approach for clustering multiple small reactor units to meet intermediate-
to-large process heat loads has received much less attention. This section discusses a novel method
for clustering multiple SmAHTR reactor units to meet thermal energy loads greater than 125 MWt.
The method not only provides the ability to meet larger thermal energy loads but, as will be
discussed, offers the potential to enhance the robustness of the overall SmAHTR energy system by
buffering interruptions in the thermal energy load from the reactors and/or buffering interruptions in
one or more reactor operations from each other and from the thermal energy load.

The use of liquid salts as a thermal energy storage medium is not a new concept. Significant work
has been done to explore the utility of liquid salts—particularly as energy storage media in solar
thermal energy systems."* Indeed, the (3 x 50 MWe) Andasol solar thermal power plant in Spain,
which began commercial operation in 2008, uses a two-tank (hot tank—cold tank) liquid-salt thermal
energy storage system coupled to a steam—water Rankine power conversion system. The thermal
storage salt medium (a 60% NaNO;-50% KNO; mixture) used at Andasol is the same as that
successfully demonstrated in the DOE Solar-1 and Solar-1II pilot plants in Barstow, California. The
Andasol plant’ stores thermal energy at 390°C in a 14 m high, 36 m diameter hot tank. The salt is
pumped thorough a salt-to-water heat exchanger where it transfers its energy to a water loop, which
then drives a traditional Rankine power conversion cycle to deliver 7.5 hr of electricity production
from the fully charged hot tank. The salt is collected in the cold tank where it is reheated by the solar
thermal system. These terrestrial systems typically use relatively low-temperature salts of various
compositions and operate at temperatures up to 400°C—too low for optimal SmAHTR applications.

Higher temperature salts (including fluoride salts) have been explored for a number of years by
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration as a medium for storing thermal energy for
in-space solar dynamic power applications.*

7.2 THE SALT VAULT CONCEPT

Figure 7.1 is a simplified depiction of the SmMAHTR “salt vault” thermal energy storage system
with four SmMAHTR units. (The salt vault heat exchanger configuration depicted in Fig. 7.1 is notional
in nature. Considerable work remains to optimize the design of the salt vault system.) The cluster of
SmAHTR units dumps its thermal energy into the salt vault, which in turn serves as a thermal energy
reservoir for the process heat or power production customer. The simplistic salt vault concept

depicted in Fig. 7.1 uses four charging heat exchangers (one from each SmAHTR unit) and one
demand-side heat exchanger to convey the process heat to the customer (or potentially to a power
conversion system).

7.3 EXTRACTING ENERGY FROM THE SmAHTR THERMAL ENERGY STORAGE
SALT VAULT

There are a variety of process heat applications for SmAHTR reactors and potential methods for
extracting energy from the salt vault. While it would be desirable from a thermal efficiency
standpoint to locate the SmAHTR modules and salt vault energy storage system as close as possible
to the process heat load, i practice it mght be necessary to “ferry” heat for distances of a few
kilometers. Figure 7.2 is a more detailed version of Fig. 7.1 that depicts some of these energy
extraction and transport options.

Some SmMAHTR process heat applications may be able to directly use the salt in the salt vault as
the heat transport fluid in a directly coupled process heat demand loop (Loop A in Fig. 7.2). Other
process heat applications might require an additional degree of isolation from the reactor intermediate
cooling loop. Such applications could be handled via a second indirectly coupled process heat
demand loop (Loop B in Fig. 7.2) that uses a demand-side heat exchanger in the salt vault. From a
thermal efficiency standpoint, the indirect approach introduces an undesirable temperature drop
across the intermediate loop heat exchanger in the salt vault and therefore reduces the temperature at
which energy is supplied to the process heat customer.

subsystem details.

Finally, electrical power conversion subsystems may be interfaced either with the salt vault or
directly with the reactor intermediate heat transport loops. As noted in the introduction to this section,
the Solar-I and Solar-II demonstration projects and the more recent commercial experience of the
Andasol solar thermal power station provide proof-of-concept for the industrial use of liquid-salt
thermal storage and heat transport mediums—and the coupling of the thermal storage system with a
power conversion system to produce electricity. Figure 7.2 depicts such a system, in which a
dedicated energy extraction loop for electrical power production is added (Loop C). Salt from the salt
vault is pumped via Loop C through a power conversion heat exchanger (where it transfers energy to
the power conversion system working fluid) and then back either to the salt vault or, conceivably,
directly to the intermediate heat transfer loop. Thus the power conversion system could be configured
to draw its energy directly from one or more reactors or from the entire reactor cluster via the salt
vault.

74 SmAHTR SALT VAULT THERMAL ENERGY STORAGE DESIGN
CONSIDERATIONS AND FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

The SmAHTR salt vault concept provides, in principle, a number of desirable performance
features:

e an elegantly simple way of combining the thermal output from multiple reactor units to meet
larger heat loads,

e increased reliability on energy supply to the customer, and

e a softer system response to transients—both on the customer demand side and on the reactor
supply side.

These benefits are gained at the cost of the additional system complexity required to couple the
SmAHTR reactor modules and the customer demand to the salt vault. A number of questions are
evident, including the following.

e Should the three intermediate heat transport loops from each reactor be ganged together at the
reactor into a single-feed return line to and from the salt vault? This would necessitate only
one supply-side heat exchanger in the salt vault per reactor but would eliminate the
redundancy of three intermediate heat transport loops outside of the reactor.

e Should the intermediate loop circulating pumps be placed in the supply (hot) leg of the
intermediate heat transport loop (and thus draw suction on the PHXs), or should they be
placed in the return (cold) leg of the intermediate heat transport loop (and feed the PHXs)?

e Should the salt vault heat exchanger feed and return lines all enter the salt vault from the top,
and if so, how does this influence the optimal design of the heat exchangers?

— What is the optimal shape for the salt vault?
— What is the optimal placement strategy for the heat exchangers within the salt vault?
— What is the optimal approach for insulating the salt vault from its surroundings?

The trade studies necessary to address these issues and to develop an integrated set of criteria and
guidelines for sizing the vault itself have not been performed at this point.

Several functional requirements and design constraints will impact the actual design of a specific
salt vault system. Table 7.1 summarizes some of the more significant salt vault design considerations.
Table 7.2 summarizes some very preliminary salt vault sizing analyses for salt vaults sized to provide
10,100 and 1,000 MWt-hr of energy while operating over a temperature range from 500°C to 600°C.
(A salt vault sized to store 125 MWt-hr of energy could absorb or deliver 1 reactor-hr of the thermal
output of a single SmMAHTR unit.) All calculations assume no heat losses from the salt vault to its
surroundings. While a broad range of candidate fluoride salts is available, the two salts selected for
this analysis constitute a representative sample. The first conclusion that can be drawn from the
analysis is that the physical size of the salt vaults is not large. A cubic salt vault measuring 10-11 m
per side would be sufficient to store 100 MWt-hours of energy, and a cubic salt vault measuring
21-24 m per side would be large enough to store 1,000 MWt-hours of energy. A second conclusion
from Table 7.2 is that the cost of the salt itself may not be prohibitive compared to the overall cost of
the nuclear plant—on the order of $2 million to $23 million for a 100 MWt-hours vault and possibly
as low as a few tens of millions of dollars for the 1,000 MWt-hours vault.

Tables 7.3 and 7.4 summarize the results of a simple analysis of the energy and time required to
raise a salt vault sized to store 125 MW (1 reactor-hr) of SmMAHTR thermal energy from a starting
temperature of 20°C to the fluoride salt melting temperature, completely melt the salt, and raise the
temperature of the entire salt vault from the melting temperature to the assumed 600°C salt vault
operating temperature. Table 7.3 presents the results in terms of energy required. Table 7.4 presents
the results in terms of reactor-hours required assuming the entire thermal output of a single 125 MWt

thermal management standpoint but may not be possible due to the
heat exchanger mechanical interface considerations.

Impacts operational characteristics of the salt vault, melt/freeze
behavior, interfaces with multiple SmAHTR units, etc. The
placement of the heat exchangers relative to each other and to the
walls of the salt vault will be a critical optimization parameter.

8. SmAHTR ELECTRICAL POWER CONVERSION OPTIONS

8.1 INTRODUCTION

As a high-temperature system, SmMAHTR is potentially compatible with several highly efficient
(>40% thermal efficiency) power conversion technologies. The most attractive options for power
conversion systems are Rankine and Brayton cycle technologies. One particularly appealing option is
for the system to be coupled to a high-efficiency closed-cycle supercritical carbon dioxide (S-CO,)
power conversion system. S-CO, power conversion is an emerging technology that can potentially
provide a combination of small system components and high operating efficiency even at modest
operating temperatures.

Multi-reheat helium Brayton systems are also viable options, though they are less compact than
the supercritical Brayton systems. Peterson and Forsberg' examined closed-cycle helium, open-air
cycles, and S-CO, cycles for salt-cooled reactors at temperature ranges similar to those of the
SmAHTR concept. Helium Brayton systems with the same conversion efficiency as S-CO, systems in
the temperature range of interest (~700°C) are generally more complex and have larger components
than S-CQO,; systems. The S-CO, systems can provide good efficiency at lower temperatures and have
smaller and fewer components. Helium Brayton power conversion systems should provide better
efficiency at higher temperatures, but to date, success with the large helium systems has been limited.
Thus far based on preliminary screening, S-CO, systems appear to be the superior approach for a
SmAHTR concept operating at ~700°C, while a multi-reheat helium Brayton system or even an
open-air Brayton system would be the system of choice as the concept evolves to higher operating
temperatures.

There are numerous ways to configure a S-CO, system. For this study, the recompression cycle
was chosen for investigation because recent research suggests small-scale systems are relatively easy
to control. However, significant development effort is required to develop the system to sizes
applicable to SmMAHTR. Heat exchangers represent the most significant technology development need
if these systems are to be practical. Ongoing research” is being conducted to improve the performance
(reduce the volume) of the printed circuit-board heat exchanger technology that will hopefully make
it reliable and economical in the future. Small heat exchangers coupled with the small SmAHTR
reactor and S-CO, turbo-machinery have the potential to make the SmMAHTR a factory-built
transportable system.

The use of S-CO, Brayton or Rankine cycles in binary geothermal power conversion cycles has
the potential to generate electricity with relatively high efficiency using smaller turbo-machinery and
is currently under investigation within DOE.? The key feature that allows higher efficiency
conversion in a supercritical Brayton cycle is the rapid change in physical properties as a function of
pressure near the critical point. For Rankine systems, it is waste heat rejection at constant and lower
temperature coupled with reduced pumping power requirements in the liquid phase. Carbon dioxide is
an excellent candidate for supercritical operation because it is stable and not very reactive at the
temperatures of interest. Also, CO, has a low critical temperature (304 K). However, the drawback to
using CO, as a supercritical fluid is its high critical pressure (7.4 MPa).

Gas Brayton power conversion has been proposed for a number of high-temperature reactor
concepts, typically using helium as the working fluid. Helium is a low atomic mass gas, which
requires that the turbo-machinery equipment be large and therefore expensive. It is also difficult to
limit leakage, both within the system and out of the system. Helium is relatively expensive, but as an
nert gas, it is promising for high-temperature applications. The efficiency of helium Brayton systems
can exceed 50% at temperatures near 800°C.

Because of near-term material limitations, evolutionary reactor concepts like SmMAHTR may enter
the market at operating temperatures of ~700°C, below the longer term goals of 800—1,200°C.

Figure 8.1 shows the predicted cycle efficiencies for various power conversion technologies as a

function of turbine inlet temperature.* Below 500°C, steam systems and S-CO, systems are
competitive. Steam systems however have limited evolutionary potential. S-CQO, systems have the
potential of achieving cycle efficiencies above 40% for temperatures greater than 450°C, while
helium-based systems typically require an additional 200°C temperature increase to achieve the same
cycle efficiency as a S-CO, system. It seems likely that helium systems can indeed evolve to higher
temperatures than S-CO; systems due to the potential of CO; to dissociate; however, the S-CO, power
conversion system appears to be the appropriate technology to consider for SmAHTR in an
intermediate temperature variant.

8.2 SUPERCRITICAL CO, POWER CONVERSION SYSTEMS

The possibilities for combining SmAHTR reactors to S-CO, power conversion systems extend
from multiple reactors feeding a single power conversion loop down to three 17 MWe power
conversion loops coupled to the three independent loops of a single SmAHTR reactor. S-CO; power
conversion 1s being tested today at power levels approaching 1 MW, and plans to build and test units
in the range of 10 MWe are currently being considered, so this technology is already becoming
relevant to the smaller power levels possible for SmMAHTR. Conceptual designs have been developed
for power levels as high as 300 MWe, and some current conceptual design studies are looking beyond
1,000 MWe.

In the SmAHTR-S-CO, concept, a salt-to-S-CO, heat exchanger transfers heat to the CO,
working fluid. The supercritical pressure of the CQO; in the heat exchanger is greater than 20 MPa.
This high pressure along with the highest temperatures within the power conversion loop result in
perhaps the major design challenge for the development of S-CQO; power conversion system for use
with reactors. Numerous arrangements of Brayton power systems are possible, and the options are
similar to those of a traditional steam cycle including the number of turbines, shafts, and reheaters.
For the S-CQO, systems, current interest has focused on the recompression cycle, shown schematically
in Fig. 8.2, as an attractive option in terms of a limited number of components and relatively high
conversion. The S-CQO, recompression Brayton system for SmAHTR incorporates a salt-to-gas heat
exchanger, high-temperature and low-temperature recuperators, a waste heat rejection heat exchanger,

produce a cycle efficiency in excess of 40% at temperatures above 450°C and offers controllability

couple the shaft to a 3,600 rpm generator.

In the recompression concept, the high-temperature recuperator transfers as much as three times
the power input through the salt-to-CO; heat exchanger, so while the peak temperatures in the
high-temperature recuperator are lower than those of the salt-to-CO, heat exchanger, it still has high
pressure differential requirements and it transfers more power. The low-ternperature recuperator
transfers approximately one-third of the power of the high-temperature recuperator; however, due to
the lower temperature potential available for a low-temperature recuperator, the recuperators are
apptoximately the same size. The power conversion turbo-machinery and the system heat exchangers
are the major power conversion system components, with the heat exchangers being larger in terms of
both size and cost. The ability to develop affordable, compact heat exchanger technology to work
with this power conversion system is an important development issue that is currently the focus of a
significant amount of research.

The Printed Circuit Heat Exchanger©@ was developed by Heatric of Dorset, England, which is a
division of the Meggitt Corporation. The concept uses chemically etched flow channels on a series of
stacked plates. The plates are diffusion bonded, which eurrently limits the size of components. Over
400 units are reportedly operating worldwide for a broad of range of application up to 50 MPa and
S00°C. Some units have reportedly been in service more than 12 years. Plate fin heat exchangers have
been widely used as recuperators in the field of power generation. Ingersoll Rand Energy Systerns in
Portsmouth, New Hampshire, has developed plate fin heat exchanger technology in which the folded
fins are brazed to the stamped plates to form unit cells. The unit cells can be stacked to form an
entirely welded pressure boundary. The configuration is specifically designed to accommodate
substantial thermal strain and therefore to tolerate the severe temperature gradients encountered
during transient operations, which is important for any reactor concept.

SmAHTR reactor. In the single power conversion system approach, the three in-vessel salt-to-salt
heat exchangers would transfer the heat from the primary salt coolant to a single intermediate salt.

Other pure fluids that are considered plausible for lower temperature supercritical power systems
include methane, neon, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, hexane and sulfur hexafluoride (SF¢). These
fluids all have physical characteristics that make them attractive working fluids; however, there are
also concerns regarding system pressures, corrosiveness, flammability, health effects, and costs. Four
candidate fluids, CO,, SFs, xenon, and propane, were evaluated as potential working fluids in low-
temperature supercritical Brayton cycles. The values of the critical temperatures and pressures for
these fluids are listed in Table 8.1.

fluids for low-temperature supercritical Brayton power
conversion systems

SF¢ 319 3,755

The supercritical temperature and pressure of these fluids can be altered by mixing them.’
Table 8.2 shows the estimated critical parameters of CO, mixed with 10% helium and with 10%
hexane. Helium can lower the critical temperature, and hexane can raise it.

be manipulated by mixing fluids

Critical temperature (K) 304 274 324
Critical pressure (kPa) 7,377 6,989 5,918

 

The ability to vary the critical temperature of supercritical working fluids can be very beneficial
for power systems. Fluids can potentially be tuned to available sink and adjusted to accommodate
seasonal or long-term changes in heat rejection conditions. Supercritical Rankine and Brayton cycles
are being considered even for lower temperature applications such as LWRs and geothermal energy
extraction because they potentially offer efficiency increases and component size reductions over
competing steam and organic Rankine cycles (ORC). For the same turbine inlet temperatures, these
advanced supercritical cycles offer the potential of more power with lower capital investment while
rejecting less waste heat to the environment.

Eventually reactor power systems will advance to higher temperatures as new materials become
available and our understanding of them improves. However, in the near term, reactor temperatures
200-300°C higher than today’s LWRs are perhaps going to be considered advanced. S-CO, power
conversion is an excellent matching technology to these intermediate reactor temperatures. It is
however difficult to foresee a reactor concept being developed to work in conjunction with S-CO,
power conversion until the technology matures. A demonstration of a S-CO, power system at a
relevant power level, perhaps in the range of 10 MWe, coupled to a non-nuclear heat source is a
plausible first step for demonstrating S-CO, power conversion systems. Once operating experience
has been gained, the technology can be given serious consideration for operation with the next
generation of advanced nuclear reactors. The experienced gained in lower risk and perhaps lower

8-5
temperature environments will be invaluable in moving the technology forward. It is recommended
that nuclear and non-nuclear programs within DOE work together with industry to find the right
opportunity to fund such an effort.

9. SmAHTR OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

9.1 INTRODUCTION

The SmMAHTR preconceptual design has not matured to the point where the full spectrum of
operational issues has been identified and resolved. The discussion that follows represents an initial
effort to identify a workable methodology for performing the major tasks necessary for installing and
operating a SmAHTR reactor. While no detailed planning has yet taken place for any of the
individual tasks required and undoubtedly unanticipated challenges will arise, no major technological
hurdles are apparent in any of the primary tasks evaluated.

9.2 TRANSPORT AND INSTALLATION

SmAHTR will be a small, modular nuclear power plant. The entire power plant is intended to be
truck transportable, with no single component too large or heavy to fit on a flatbed truck. The largest
power plant components will be the reactor vessel and the salt-to-gas SHX. The containment structure
will be mostly below grade, and its design maximum loading requirements are dominated by impact
or earthquake events since FHR-class reactors lack mechanisms to generate large pressures or
significant projectiles. The resultant thinner (as compared to those required for LWRSs) containment
walls are well suited for “open-top-type” installation and steel-plate sandwich wall construction.

The SmMAHTR reactor vessel will be transported to the site unfueled and unfilled. The reactor
vessel has no penetrations and 1s thus essentially a large open pot. The vessel wall thickness 1s
25 mm, and the vessel mass is slightly less than 25 tons. All of the vessel internal structures are hung
from the vessel top flange (Sect. 4.2). The reactor vessel flange assembly will be transported to the
site separately from the vessel. The vessel central flange and SiC-SiC composite core hanging rods
will be joined to the core top plate on site. Control rods will be placed in the core during factory
assembly and attached to the vessel central flange as part of the mating process between the core and
the vessel internals.

The reactor will be deployed into a below-grade metal-lined pre-stressed concrete silo. The silo
will be thermally connected to the ground to maintain the concrete and liner well below 100°C during
reactor operation. The silo serves three principal functions: (1) containment, (2) well to maintain the
reactor salt above the top of the DHXs in case of vessel rupture, and (3) cooled boundary to trap
tritium that has diffused through the hot reactor vessel.

The silo will have a relatively close fit to the exterior of the reactor vessel to minimize the amount
of primary coolant salt that must be kept above the core to ensure that the DHXs remain covered in
the event of vessel failure. Only sufficient space for automated access for in-service inspection will be
provided. All but minor maintenance activities (insulation repair) will thus require lifting the reactor
vessel for access.

The exterior of the reactor vessel will be wired with electrical heaters with sufficient power to
heat the vessel to above the salt melting point. The vessel and heater assembly will be encased within
a close-fitting insulator assembly. All reactor components will be well insulated on their exterior
surface. The vessel, heaters, and insulation will be transported to the site as a single unit. High-
sensitivity, power-range flux measurement instrumentation will be incorporated into the insulation
assembly.

9.3 INITIAL FUELING AND HEAT-UP
The reactor core will be factory assembled, including both the core top and bottom support plates

and structural skirting (Sect. 4.2). The core support rods are threaded at each end. The upper ends of
the rods pass through the vessel central flange and are bolted externally. The lower ends of the rods

9-1
are screwed into the upper core support plate. The control rods are then mated to their drive
mechanisms, and the in-core and top-core instrumentation (flux and temperature measurements) are
slid into the guide tubes built into the core.

SmAHTR employs long-shaft, cantilevered primary pumps. All bearings and seals are located
above the reactor vessel flange. The in-vessel heat exchangers, pumps, and instrumentation are all
factory installed onto top vessel flange wedges. The reflector, core barrel, flow skirting, and top
flange exterior rim structure will be factory preassembled and transported to the site as a single piece.
The start-up source and fission chamber (not shown in Fig. 9.1) will be loaded into recesses in the
reflector. Both will be withdrawn through the top of the reactor vessel once the reactor begins its
ascent to power. The reflector assembly also includes a salt siphon tube that extends from above the
top flange down to the bottom of the reactor vessel.

The reactor vessel assembly procedure begins by first lowering the reactor vessel onto its support
brackets. Next the reflector package is lowered into place and bolted to the reactor vessel top flange.
The heat exchangers and pump wedge segments are then lowered into the recesses provided for them
in the top flange and bolted into place. The secondary side coolant piping and siphon tube are then
bolted onto the piping stubs protruding from the vessel top flange, and the pumps are confirmed to be
properly rotating. The core assembly structure is then lowered into the reactor vessel and the top

flange bolted shut.

Once all of the structures inside the reactor vessel have been assembled and the top flange closed,
the system will first be pressure checked by evacuating it through the gas control lines on the top
flange. Dry helium will then be introduced into the vessel using the bottom siphon tube. Helium flow
will be employed to dry out the moisture contained within the internal graphite during transport. The
helium will be removed from the vessel using the cover gas control system piping. The vessel heaters
will be employed to bring the interior structures to between 100°C and 150°C. Helium flow will be
maintained until the gas exiting the core has no residual moisture. The siphon line will then be
disconnected from the gas supply (to avoid the possibility of core voiding) and connected to the salt
supply manifold emerging from the salt-handling tanks. The reactor vessel will then be heated to
above the salt melting point (525°C nominally) using the external heaters.

9.4 SALT LOADING

The reactor salt inventory will be preloaded into salt-handling tanks. Between 50 and 60 m” of
salt will be required for the initial primary inventory with additional primary salt required during
refueling operation. The salt-handling tanks provide the volume necessary to store the primary salt
inventory if the salt is ever siphoned from the reactor vessel for maintenance purposes. The salt-
handling tanks will also incorporate a salt purification dip tube so that hydrogen fluoride and
hydrogen can be bubbled through the salt to remove impurities in the salt accumulated during
service.' The salt-handling tanks will also include helium sparging tubing to remove tritium from
the salt.

The salt-handling tanks provide structured melting of the salt. Fluoride salts expand upon
melting, and an important operational parameter is thus to melt the salt from a free surface. While
conceptually the salt could be allowed to freeze within the reactor vessel and be melted from its top
surface, the current operational intent is to never freeze the salt within the reactor vessel but instead to
siphon the salt into handling tanks for any long-term cold shutdown events. Following initial start-up,
decay heat and natural circulation will maintain the primary salt as a liquid for any anticipated
operational occurrence.

All of the tubing interconnecting the salt-handling tanks to the reactor vessel siphon tube will be
preheated to 550°C using external trace heating. Simultaneously all of the salt within the handling
tanks will be melted using their structured heating systems. The pressure over the salt-handling tanks
will then be increased one after another to siphon the salt from the tank into the reactor vessel. Once
any one tank is emptied, its temperature will be lowered and a salt plug will formed in its dip tube to
disconnect it from the reactor vessel. The reactor fill level will be monitored both by a radar-type
level measurement system located in a standpipe above the top of the reactor vessel flange as well as
thermocouples mounted to the exterior of the reactor vessel.

Cold (550°C) hydraulic and instrumentation validation testing will be performed once the salt has
been introduced into the reactor vessel. The start-up neutron source and start-up fission chambers will
then be introduced into the vessel through the in-reflector guide tubes, and cold subcritical neutronic
measurements will be made. The reactor then will begin the initial approach to critical system
validation path.

9.5 IN-SERVICE INSPECTIONS AND MAINTENANCE

Much of the in-service inspection and maintenance technology for SmAHTR power plants is
directly analogous to that for LWRs. Motor current signature analysis will be applied to pumps as an
indication of wear. Also, vibration measurements will be made on the external vessel structures to
observe changes in performance. All of the reactor instrumentation signals will be evaluated for shifts
in their noise and/or deviations from the anticipated signals based upon other measurements and the
reactor performance model.

9-3
SmAHTR’s containment outside the reactor vessel will be filled with dry nitrogen during
operation. The nitrogen will be continuously circulated past a tritium-trapping organic catalyst similar
to that used by heavy-water-moderated reactors to trap the emerging tritium. While both beryllium
and tritium contamination will be almost certain (so contained breathing apparatus will be required),
the space above the top flange of the reactor will not be acutely hazardous (either thermally or
radioactively) during operation, and periodic access for component maintenance would be possible.

The primary salt chemistry control system will be employed to monitor the chromium and iron
content of the primary salt as an indication of metallic corrosion. The primary salt chemistry control
system provides access to the primary salt through tubes in the top flange. The salt chemistry control
system enables reduction—oxidation state adjustment of the primary salt through contact with
beryllium, much as was done during the MSRE.

In-service inspection of the in-vessel components will be primarily visual from above the salt
surface. The salt is transparent, enabling visual access to immersed components via a window in the
top flange. While the optical window will need to be mechanically wiped periodically to remove the
salt vapor from its exposed surface, optical inspection should be possible on-line using a remote-
controlled telescope and camera system. Once the reactor has been defueled, more detailed
inspections of the reactor internals can be performed by raising the systems out of the salt or
siphoning the salt from the vessel and lowering remote inspection equipment into the empty vessel.

9.6 REFUELING

SmAHTR features a cartridge core. The core is intended to be replaced as a unit and can be lifted
from the vessel separately from the other in-vessel components. Refueling is performed with the salt
maintained in liquid state, but at the reactor cold temperature (~550°C). At least 36 hr of core
cooldown in the vessel is required before beginning core transfer to enable the core decay heat to fall
below 1 MW. Refueling begins by unbolting the central top flange (that the core is hung from) from
the reactor vessel flange.

A bottom-loading fuel transport cask is then positioned on top of the reactor vessel. The bottom
of the transport cask is mated to the vessel flange with a seal at the interface and bolted down.
Figure 9.1 shows the configuration of the refueling components and reactor vessel. The cask exterior
surface will be covered with fins to enhance the natural convective heat transfer. Initial calculations
indicate that for a reasonably sized transport cask (30 cm clearance from the core), natural draft
cooling will provide 1 MW of decay heat removal at 650°C. The reactor vessel top plenum and
fuel transfer cask are flooded with primary salt using the reactor salt-handling system prior to lifting
the core.

The reactor core is then lifted into the fuel transfer cask, and the bottom cask closure dual gate
valve 1s shut. The cask is then unbolted from the top of the reactor vessel and the core lowered onto
the cask bottom. The bolts connecting the SiC-SiC core support cage to the central vessel top flange
are then removed, and the central vessel top flange is lifted away. Next the core supporting rods are
unscrewed from the top core support plate and lifted away. A top closure is then bolted to the fuel
transfer cask. Figure 9.2 shows the closed fuel transfer cask on top of the reactor vessel. The entire
fuel transfer cask 1s then immersed in the spent-fuel storage pool filled with a poisoned low-cost salt
(such as europium-loaded KF-ZrF,) and allowed to decay until just before the next core needs to be
removed from the reactor.

The decay heat from the reactor core is less than 100 kW after 1-2 years of storage. At this point
the core is removed from the transfer cask and placed directly into the storage pool filled with
poisoned low-cost salt. Figure 9.3 shows the SmAHTR spent-fuel storage pool including both older
cores in direct contact with the pool salt and a core still in its transfer cask. The transfer of the core
out of the transfer cask occurs by first screwing a lifting structure to the core top plate and then lifting
the core out of the top of the salt-filled transfer cask into an inert-gas-filled transfer channel. The
large mass of the core and the low decay heat enable a slow (days) spent core transfer without

overheating the fuel. The expensive primary salt is then siphoned from the fuel transfer cask and
recycled into the reactor primary salt-handling system, and the fuel transfer cask is reused to transfer
the next spent core.

9.7 IN-VESSEL COMPONENT SERVICING AND REPLACEMENT

The reactor vessel internals are modular and designed to be independently replaceable. As
discussed in Chaps. 4 and 5, the PHX and DHX are mounted to independent segments of the
SmAHTR top flange. The primary pumps and in-vessel heat exchangers can be independently
removed for inspection and maintenance by lifting from above using the fuel-handling crane. The
primary coolant pump will be integrally mounted to the top of the PHX; thus, the two components
will be withdrawn and serviced together.

10. SmAHTR UNIT CAPITAL AND OPERATIONS COST

10.1 SmAHTR COST AND ECONOMICS

Capital costs and economic performance of the SmAHTR reactor are a function of the specific
deployment scenario. The initial SmAHTR concept focuses on transportability and ease of
installation, with a cluster of small reactors intended to be brought into operation in a short time with
minimal field construction or other infrastructure. Applications may be generation of electricity,
high-temperature process heat for chemical processing, geologic materials extraction, or other
processes. Because most existing reactors (aside from research and test reactors) have been built to
generate electricity, this section discusses cost and economics in the context of electricity generation
applications.

For electricity generation, SmAHTR 1is expected to deliver heat at a high temperature to a
compact Brayton cycle turbine and generator. This report describes a reactor and supercritical CO,
power conversion system that generate about 50 MWe in a single-unit application, or 200 MWe in a
four-unit set, with a common salt vault. The motivation and economics for such a system can differ
significantly from a large base-load plant, where the electrical output of a multi-unit site can exceed
3,000 MWe. Applications for electricity generation using a SmAHTR could include providing
moderate amounts of secure power to a remote site, where other fuels may not be readily available or
the electrical infrastructure does not support installation of a large generating facility. The cost of
generating electricity with a small reactor is not expected to be will be comparable to the cost of
electricity in a highly developed area. A complete estimate of capital and operating cost, leading to a
life-cycle cost estimate or comprehensive economic model for supplying electricity or process heat, is
not practical at the current level of system definition. Rather, various factors that drive cost relative to
traditional LWRs are identified. Ease of implementation is impacted by the magnitude of capital cost
required for design, licensing, fabrication, installation, and start-up of the plant. Financing must be
identified, and in a commercial model, recovery of capital cost is a large portion of the cost of
electricity. Manpower dominates the operations and maintenance cost for existing reactors, with fuel
cost and other materials adding to the total. Ultimately, the cost of generating electricity is the sum of
operating and capital recovery costs divided by the amount of electricity generated.

In applications where a larger amount of low-cost electricity i1s desired (as with most existing
reactors), a larger AHTR may be more appropriate. Many of the cost factors identified in the
following section would be applicable to both the SmMAHTR and to large AHTRs. Several past efforts
have 1dentified cost differences between fluoride-salt-cooled reactors and other reactor systems. A
comparison of cost factors, and rough costs, between a large AHTR, the liquid-metal-cooled
S-PRISM, and the gas-cooled GT-MHR is found in Chap. 8 of Ref. 1.

10.2 UNIT CAPITAL COST CONSIDERATIONS
10.2.1 Favorable Cost Drivers

A number of considerations suggest the nth of kind production and capital costs of smarter
modules can be attractive.

e High operating temperature, leading to high thermal efficiency and smaller equipment for the
same electrical or useful thermal energy output.

e High operating temperature, enabling the use of Brayton cycle power-conversion equipment
that 1s much smaller than typical Rankine steam-cycle equipment.

e Salt coolant with a high volumetric heat capacity and thermal conductivity, especially as
compared to gas-cooled alternatives for high-temperature operation.

10-1
10.2.2

Low operating pressure, leading to thinner walls in vessels and piping and reducing the
physical energy that could cause or be released in accidents.

Simplified containment system, avoiding the large pressurized containment vessels typical of
existing LWRs.

Separation of the safety significance of the reactor system from the power conversion system,
especially through the use of the salt vault.

Transparent coolant, simplifying visual inspection compared to liquid-metal-cooled reactors.
Cartridge core, minimizing fuel handling facilities.

Factory fabrication, with reduced cost and enhanced quality compared to field fabrication.
Smaller structures, resulting from the use of Brayton cycle power equipment.

Simplification of seismic design considerations, resulting from smaller equipment and
structures.

Transportation advantages, resulting from small reactor and power conversion equipment
sizes and weights.

Unfavorable Cost Drivers

The favorable cost considerations noted above may be mitigated by the following unfavorable
production and capital cost drivers.

High-temperature equipment, requiring specialty alloys and equipment for salt-containing
equipment and instrument penetrations.

Advanced alloys, with limited sources of supply.

Advanced power-conversion systems, such as supercritical CO, Brayton cycle equipment,
for which little experience and manufacturing expertise exist.

Establishment of a factory and tooling to enable factory fabrication cost savings.
Dry core, preventing the use of water pools for refueling, inspection, and maintenance.

Extensive pre-heat systems and insulation, with associated electrical power distribution
systems.

Cartridge core, in which a large shielded cask system is needed to remove and handle the
core.

Training of fabrication and construction labor force in working with unusual equipment
and alloys.

Some of the favorable cost drivers will only appear as multiple units are built; similarly, several
of the unfavorable cost drivers (such as experience with unusual materials) would decrease as the
number of units increases. A key initial consideration is the investment needed to create a factory
environment with appropriate tooling as compared to the opportunity for cost recovery until a larger
number of units are built.

10-2
10.3 UNIT OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE COST CONSIDERATIONS
10.3.1 Favorable Cost Drivers

A number of considerations suggest the operations and maintenance costs of smarter modules can
be attractive.

High operating temperature, leading to better fuel utilization and reduced waste heat.
Cartridge core, simplifying the refueling operation.

Integrated reactor assembly designed for component removal and replacement.

Simplified decay-heat-removal system, minimizing safety-related equipment maintenance
and inspection.

Small components, especially in the turbine hall.

e Transportable components, leading to the possibility of off-site factory refurbishment.

10.3.2 Unfavorable Cost Drivers

The favorable cost considerations noted above may be mitigated by the following unfavorable
operations and maintenance cost drivers.

e Possibility of a large base-load staff in comparison to the amount of power generated,
including operators, maintenance, fire brigade, security, and administration personnel.

e Need for operations and maintenance staff with special training in the application of
unusual technologies.

¢ Handling of spent fuel as an intact assembly, using large shielded casks, as opposed to the
familiar approaches of handling individual assemblies with simple equipment in a water pool.

e Impact of pre-heat systems and insulation on inspection and maintenance activities.

e As with capital cost, some of the unfavorable challenges fade as additional units come into
operation, a larger trained labor pool is developed, and the availability of replacement
components and appropriately equipped shop facilities grows.

10.4 SUMMARY

The previous discussion has noted a number of both favorable and unfavorable production,
capital, operations, and maintenance cost drivers for SmMAHTR modules. These cost considerations
stem from both the generic attributes of FHRs and small modular reactors. Further exploration of the
cost and economic performance of SmMAHTR should be conducted following finalization of the
reactor fuel and core configuration and further definition of the SmAHTR power conversion and salt
vault energy storage systems.

11. SmAHTR DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY

11.1 INTRODUCTION

This section presents a brief assessment of the potential technology and system evolution
possibilities for SmMAHTR. As discussed in Chaps. 1 and 2, the initial evolution of the SmAHTR
concept presented in this report is the product of a trade-space study of “small” fluoride-salt-cooled
high-temperature reactors. In some sense SmMAHTR and the original AHTR concept are “bookends”
describing the very small and the very large FHR concept space. The numerous trade studies and
compromises are embodied in the current SmMAHTR concept. With respect to the potential evolution
pathway for SmAHTR concepts, many questions are evident. Three major questions will be briefly
discussed here.

e Should SmAHTR concepts grow to sizes larger than 125 MWt?

e Should SmAHTR concepts evolve to temperatures higher than 700°C, and if so, what are the
reasonable design temperature evolution points?

e Should SmAHTR evolve to other power-conversion-system technologies?

With regard to the optimal size for SmMAHTR, there appears to be no fundamental limit that
requires the integral reactor power level be limited to 125 MWt. However, as discussed in previous
sections, multiple SmMAHTR units can be easily clustered together to meet higher thermal energy
and electricity demands. Thus the prospects of relatively easy transport of a SmAHTR reactor to
diverse field locations, coupled with the potential for cost advantages derived from factory
fabrication of a smaller reactor, suggest that a detailed evaluation is necessary, before a decision can
be made regarding optimization of SmMAHTR’s power level and the need for “larger SmAHTRs.”

Concerning evolution of SmMAHTR operating temperatures above 700°C, it is clear that FHR
coolants and TRISO fuels employed in this initial SmMAHTR evolutionary stage are capable of
operating at much higher temperatures. However, the desire to avoid the unnecessary obstacle of
creating an entirely new structural material in order to design and build the first SmAHTR prototype
commends the more conservative approach of adopting only 700°C as the initial core outlet coolant
temperature limit. Indeed, a pragmatic approach to SmMAHTR demonstration would probably involve
operating the reactor at temperatures as low as 600°C for a period of time prior to ascension to higher
temperatures. The value of having a small, reliable very-high-temperature reactor operating at
temperatures of 800°C, 900°C, or even 1,000°C would be significant, and perhaps transformational in
terms of the architecture of our overall energy enterprise.

In a similar manner, the power conversion system embodied in the current SmMAHTR evolution
utilizes supercritical CO, Brayton technology, which, while well suited to the 700°C operating
temperature of the current concept, is not appropriate for temperatures much above 800°C, where
indirect-helium and direct-air Brayton technologies become more competitive. Hence, the selection of
the power conversion technology for a very-high-temperature SmMAHTR operating at 900°C or above
would almost certainly be different from the that presented here.

With these considerations in mind, some thought has been given to the central question of the
materials performance barriers currently evident that limit SmAHTR to the 700°C operating range,
and how these materials challenges can be addressed to enable SmAHTR concepts with much higher
operating temperatures.

11.2 MATERIALS CONSIDERATIONS FOR TEMPERATURE EVOLUTION
OF SmAHTR

The materials of construction for the primary and secondary systems of SmAHTR will be
required to have adequate strength, toughness, corrosion resistance, and radiation tolerance. Based on
currently available metallic materials limitations, the early vision for SmMAHTR is a reactor with a
maximum coolant outlet temperature of 700°C, with subsequent advancements to outlet temperatures
up to 850°C and perhaps even 950-1,000°C. These advancements require a materials evolution
strategy, which is outlined in this section.

For the existing suite of high-temperature structural alloys, protection from the service
environment is afforded by the development of stable, slow-growing oxide layers, which are typically
chromia at temperatures up to around 850°C and alumina at higher temperatures. These layers reduce
alloy wastage and internal oxidation and allow for acceptable service lifetimes. As fluoride salts flux
oxide layers, this approach to alloy protection is not applicable. Instead, protection depends on
achieving thermodynamic stability and low solubility of alloying elements in the fluoride salts.

Pure nickel and alloys with very high nickel contents, and a sufficiently low content of certain
other constituents, have been shown to have excellent resistance to environmental attack in liquid-
fluoride-salt environments. However, if these materials are to provide simultaneously protection in
oxidizing environments, such as air or gases for a Brayton-cycle turbine for production of electricity
(helium, supercritical CO,, etc.), they must develop a stable oxide layer in that environment as well.
Hastelloy-N (originally called INOR-8), a commercially available, nickel-based alloy
(N17Cr--16Mo-1S1), was originally developed by the ORNL in conjunction with the MSRE in the
1960s. Over 200,000 Ib of Hastelloy-N were produced and used for construction of major MSRE
components and was explicitly designed for compatibility with molten fluoride salts. Its chromium
content 1s low but still sufficient to provide oxidation resistance in air. It is a solid-solution-
strengthened (with molybdenum) alloy that does not embrittle upon aging and has limited contents of
aluminum, titanium, and carbon to minimize fabrication and corrosion problems.

For the majority of uncooled metallic components for the 700°C outlet-temperature design (RPV,
core barrel and other metallic internals, IHXs, DRACS), it is expected that Hastelloy-N will be used
as a material of construction. Hastelloy-N has the designation of USN N10003 and has been
incorporated into ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel (B&PV) Code, Section II, Part D, Table 1B for
service up to 704°C (1,300°F) for welded construction under Section VIII, Division 1 rules. Product
forms covered include seamless and welded fittings (SB-366), plate, sheet, and strip (SB-434), and
rod (SB-573), all in annealed condition. However, Hastelloy-N is not explicitly approved for nuclear
construction within ASME’s Section 111, and significant additional materials property testing and
analysis would be required to develop and support changes to the ASME Code (i.e., either a Code
Case or modification of the main Code language in Section III) to cover such usage. Notwithstanding,
Hastelloy-N has adequate strength and excellent salt and air compatibility up to 704°C and has been
successfully used in construction of both of the molten salt reactors developed at ORNL. It should
perform well in SmAHTR.

Raising the outlet temperature above about 700°C will preclude the use of Hastelloy-N for most
uncooled components because its high-temperature strength drops precipitously above that
temperature. Achieving relatively small incremental increases in operating temperature up to 750°C
or slightly above may be possible using other existing commercial high-nickel alloys, such as
Haynes 242 (a Ni-8Cr-25Mo-2.5Co0-0.8S1 age-hardenable alloy). However, Haynes 242 has not been
used for nuclear service, and significant materials qualification testing would be needed to ensure its
applicability. Other high-temperature alloys with much higher levels of chromium such as
Haynes 230 (22Cr and 5Co) may also be applicable if suitable approaches to controlling the Lewis
acidity of the salt (which affects alloying element solubility in the salt) can be developed.

For higher temperatures, structural alloys that can be used include nickel-clad or weld overlaid
superalloys such as alloys 800H, 617, or 230. For the near term, insulated structures can be used, and
for the longer term, newly developed, higher strength nickel-base alloys or even refractory-metal-
based alloys will be available.

issues must be considered. First is the question of the
adequacy of the high-nickel layer to provide protection
for the microstructure of the underlying superalloy.

be ensured.

For external components, such as the RPV or piping, it may be possible and desirable to
internally insulate the component, allowing the use of a lower service temperature alloy, such as
AS508 or A533B steel, for the pressure boundary. This
approach would require an engineering solution to
corrosion protection on the inside surface of the
component and an insulation layer sufficient to limit the
operating temperature of the alloy used to an acceptable
range, such as that schematically depicted in Fig. 11.2.
With such an approach, it would be possible to increase
the operating temperature of the coolant to 850°C or
significantly beyond and still enable the use of existing
structural alloys codified for nuclear service, but only for
components with a coolable surface. Reactor internals,
such as the core barrel or control rods, or heat exchangers
that would have to operate at temperatures at or near that
of the coolant would still require materials of construction
: with higher usage temperatures.

The long-term solution for higher temperature
operation of SAHTR up to 850°C or slightly higher will
likely require the development of a new superalloy with
both adequate mechanical properties at the operating temperature and sufficient compatibility with
the liquid salt and other required environments. Given the major overall advances in materials science
and especially in predictive thermodynamic-based modeling tools for alloy development and
evaluation, this is a very realistic possibility but would still likely require several years of
development and qualification before such an alloy could be codified for nuclear service.

Alternately, the use of carbon—carbon or SiC-SiC composites or monolithic SiC would allow for
uncooled components to temperatures up to and beyond 1,000°C, but would include very significant
qualification, codification, and regulatory activities for the design and use of such materials, as well
as ways to ensure the limited permeability needed for any pressure boundary applications. It is also
expected that the radiation resistance of this class of materials would be adequate for use in the
reactor internals for virtually all of the conditions envisioned for SmAHTR.

SmMAHTR’s graphite structures are expected to be of the fixed prismatic type with fairly fine
webs, so the use of a high-strength, fine-grained graphite will be needed. Two grades of Toyo Tanso

graphite (IG110 or 430) that are currently being qualified for use in high-temperature gas-cooled
reactors, such as the NGNP, would be well-qualified candidates. These materials are expected to pose
no significant challenges associated with increasing reactor coolant temperature up to 1,000°C.

The leading candidate materials for various components of the SmMAHTR operating at a range of

output temperatures are summarized in Table 11.1.

In summary, the performance limits of structural materials available for use in near-term
SmAHTR demonstrations would limit their operating temperature to ~700°C. In the longer term,
materials evolution strategies that would enable SmAHTR operations at 850°C and above are evident.

12. SUMMARY

12.1 SmAHTR 1.0

During the spring of 2010, a small team was assembled at Oak Ridge National Laboratory to
explore the feasibility of fluoride-salt-cooled small modular high-temperature reactors. The goals of
the team were (1) explore the technology and system architecture design trade space for such
concepts and (2) develop an initial design evolution to serve as a vehicle for understanding the
potential performance attributes of such systems and their developmental challenges. The SmMAHTR
reactor and thermal energy system presented in this report are the results of this study.

SmAHTR is a 125 MWt, integral primary system reactor concept, designed to operate with a core
outlet temperature of 700°C and a refueling interval of 3—4 years. The reactor vessel is sufficiently
small to accommodate transport to the deployment site by standard tractor-trailer vehicles.

Four SmAHTR reactor core concepts are under consideration: (1) solid cylindrical fuel pellets in
removal stringer fuel assemblies, (2) hollow annular fuel pellets in removal stringer fuel assemblies,
(3) removal fuel assemblies utilizing fuel plates or “planks,” and (4) pebble-bed cores. The first three
options were evaluated in this initial study. While the focus has been on “cartridge core” designs that
enable rapid removal and reloading of the entire core as an integrated unit, none of the fuel designs
considered to date preclude the more traditional approach of insertion and removal of individual fuel
assemblies. All fuel designs use coated-particle graphite (TRISO) fuel very similar to that specified
for a Next-Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP).

SmAHTR employs a “two-out-of-three” concept for operational heat removal and shutdown
decay-heat removal. Three 50% capacity systems operate in parallel at all times—only two of which
are required for complete functionality. The transition from operation model to shutdown decay-heat-
removal mode 1s accomplished without resorting to active system components.

The preliminary investigation of SmMAHTR’s transient response and safety attributes indicates the
system is well behaved and transitions smoothly from operations to shutdown mode while
maintaining substantial fuel temperature margins. The combination of low power density, passive
heat removal, robust coated-particle graphite fuel, low primary system operating pressure, high
coolant volumetric heat capacity, and fission product retention capability of the coolant presents a
package of performance attributes that enable a high degree of safety.

In addition to the SmMAHTR reactor system itself, a very preliminary concept has been developed
for a “salt vault” high-temperature thermal energy storage system. The integration of multiple
SmAHTR modules with the salt vault not only increases the size of the supportable energy demand
beyond that which can be met by a single unit but also provides significant additional benefits with
respect to “buffering” the customer energy demand from the reactors as a group, and the individual
reactors from each other.

This initial SmMAHTR concept evolution is not sufficiently detailed to support in-depth capital and
operating-cost analyses. However, the intrinsic attributes of the SmAHTR system (low pressure,
compact system with efficient heat transport characteristics), considered on balance, offer the
prospect of attractive nth-of-kind capital costs and competitive unit operating costs both for electricity
production and process heat applications for deployment scenarios in the 2030 time period and
beyond.

SmAHTR’s operating temperature is currently constrained by the performance limits of the
structural materials used in the reactor vessel and non-fuel internal structures. This limitation restricts
near-term SmAHTR concepts to operating temperatures of ~700°C. With this in mind, and in view of
the benefits to be gained from higher system operating temperatures, a preliminary two-step materials
development strategy has been formulated. This strategy targets expansion of the SmMAHTR concept
to 850°C and ~1,000°C in the coming decades.

12.2  SmAHTR CONCEPT EVOLUTION

The SmMAHTR concept presented here is but a snapshot of a complex technology and system
architecture trade space. SmMAHTR and the SmAHTR salt vault thermal energy system described in
this report are not optimized systems. Additional concept-definition work to be done includes
the following:

e Optimization of the fuel and core design

e Further definition of the reactivity and instrumentation and control system

e Expanded transient and safety analyses (including generation of a pre-conceptual phenomena
identification and ranking table, or PIRT, as soon as the concept is sufficiently defined to
enable the exercise)

e Optimization of the in-vessel PHX and DHX designs

e Optimization of the salt vault system design and its interface with the reactors

e Optimization of the SmAHTR electrical power conversion system design and the interface
to it

e Preliminary SmAHTR capital cost estimates

Modest investment in these activities will significantly expand our understanding of the
feasibility of the SmAHTR concept, its performance attributes, and its principal development
challenges.

12.3 ENABLING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

System concept development activities are essential elements of integrated advanced reactor
development programs because it is in the system concept that the value and promise of scientific
research and technology development are made manifest. Concept development provides the basis for
prioritizing and guiding both basic technology development and enabling component development
activities. With this in mind, a focused research, technology development, and component
demonstration program is needed to enable FHR and SmAHTR development. A focused R&D
program would include the development and optimization of fluoride-salt coolants, TRISO fuel
forms, salt-compatible structural materials (graphites, composites, metals), critical components
(pumps, heat exchangers, and valves), and high-temperature instrumentation. Based on the work
performed to date, priority must be placed on the development of compact salt-to-salt and salt-to-gas
heat exchangers. Other key component development priorities include liquid-salt pumps and the
vortex diodes that can operate in high-temperature liquid-salt environments. All of these activities
will be complemented by a basic focus on the development of high-performance, high-temperature
nuclear materials, as discussed previously.

Finally, it should be noted that SmAHTR and FHRs in general benefit from and leverage much
ongoing fuels and materials work in the DOE Office of Nuclear Energy NGNP and AGR fuels
programs.

CONSIDERATIONS
APPENDIX A. SmMAHTR FUEL TECHNOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS

A.1 COATED-PARTICLE FUEL TECHNOLOGY

The fuel form of choice for high-temperature reactors specifically designed for high-efficiency
electricity generation and high-temperature heat applications is a coated particle fuel that consists of a
small spherical core or kernel of nuclear material surrounded by pyrocarbon and SiC coatings
designed to retain the fission products during normal operation and all licensing basis events. The fuel
kernel is typically fabricated using sol-gel techniques, resulting in a high-density ceramic that retains
most of the fission products. The most common coated particle design, under development since the
early 1960s and referred to as TRISO (tri-isotropic), is typically fabricated by chemical vapor
deposition of the successive layers in a fluidized bed furnace. The innermost layer or buffer layer is
porous, low-density (~0.95 g/cc) pyrocarbon, which provides volume to accommodate kernel
swelling, fission gases, and fission dependent gases (CO and CO,) and sufficient mass to absorb
fission product recoil momentum to protect the structural layers. Three structural layers are then
applied: (1) a gas-tight high-density pyrocarbon layer (~1.95 g/cc) whose primary function is to serve
as a substrate for the SiC layer, protect the kernel from chlorine generated during SiC deposition, and
hold the SiC layer in compression; (2) a high-density SiC layer (~3.2g/cc) to serve as the primary
“pressure vessel” and fission product barrier layer to retain the metallic fission products that diffuse
through the inner pyrocarbon (IPyC) layer at high temperature; and (3) another high-density
pyrocarbon layer (~1.95 g/cc) whose primary function is to protect the SiC layer during further fuel
fabrication steps, help keep the SiC under compression during service, and provide a final barrier to
fission product release.

This fuel form is extremely versatile; for a given fast or thermal reactor mission, the TRISO
coating design remains essentially the same while the kernel’s metal loading and composition is
varied: U for energy production, U/Th for resource sustainability, and U/Pu/minor actinides for used
fuel management. Coated particle fuel is one of the few fuel forms that can be applied to high-
temperature and high-burnup applications and has the potential to achieve burnups and temperatures
significantly beyond current experience. As a result of about 50 years of research and development
worldwide, standard uranium-based TRISO fuel can now be fabricated with acceptable
performance for nominal operating conditions with roughly 800°C core outlet temperature in a
helium-cooled reactor.

A.2 SmAHTR FUEL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

While the specific fuel particle design depends on the required fuel service conditions, a
representative coated particle design that could readily be adopted for use in the Small modular
Advanced High-Temperature Reactor (SmAHTR) is the Advanced Gas Reactor-1 (AGR-1) fuel,
recently demonstrating excellent fission product retention to 4 x 10°° n/m” peak fast fluence
[E > 0.18 MeV, 19% peak fissions per initial metal atom (FIMA), and 16% average FIMA] during a
610 effective full-power-day irradiation test in the Idaho National Laboratory’s Advanced Test
Reactor.™' Figure A.1 is a cross section of a typical AGR-1 particle. Table A.1 provides the fuel
product specifications and typical batch values for coating thickness, density, microstructure, and
anisotropy. The AGR-1 fuel test is the first test in a series of irradiation tests planned to support
licensing of the Next-Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP). Two high-temperature gas-cooled reactor
(HTGR) concepts are currently being considered for the NGNP: the pebble-bed reactor and the
prismatic-block reactor. If the NGNP uses a pebble-bed design, the coated particle fuel will have a
UO, kernel. If the prismatic-block design is selected, the coated particle fuel kernel will be composed
of a mixture of UO, and UG, (also referred to as “uranium oxicarbide” or UCO) designed to mitigate
kernel migration at higher burnup, a known failure mechanism for HTGR designs having a

sufficiently high thermal gradient in the fuel body. Kernel migration, or the “amoeba effect,” is the
result of the transfer of carbon from the hot side of the kernel-buffer surface to the cold side of the
kernel-buffer surface, which causes the kernel to propagate up the temperature gradient through the
buffer and IPyC and damage the SiC layer. Careful control of the oxygen-to-metal ratio in the kernel
has been shown to eliminate kernel migration, but this adds to the complexity of the kernel fabrication
process and requires storage of the finished product in an inert atmosphere before coating. Including
carbon in the kernel controls the oxygen chemical potential (UC, + O, — UQO; + 2C), thereby
minimizing the oxygen chemical potential and shutting down the carbon transport.

Another approach to controlling the oxygen potential is to include an oxygen getter to bind up the
oxygen released from the fission of uranium (e.g., SiC + O, — Si0,; + C). While kernel migration has
been observed in pebble-bed designs, it is effectively controlled by limiting the maximum power in
the sphere and by the continuous movement of the sphere through the core. These controls result in
thermal gradients in the pebble that are smaller than the gradients in a prismatic fuel compact, and
UQO; kernel migration is negligible. Therefore, depending on the details of the SmAHTR design, the
kernel could be exclusively UO, or could be designed using the AGR-1 fuel design, either of the two
current NGNP designs, or a design incorporating SiC or ZrC in a UQO,; kernel to serve as an oxygen
getter. Incorporating SiC into the kernel is the current choice of the U.S. Department of Energy Office
of Nuclear Energy, Deep Burn program.**

Table A.2 provides a comparison of the fuel service conditions among various high-temperature
reactor concepts. Note that the SmMAHTR conceptual design may require fuel operating at a power
density outside the bounds that have been demonstrated to date. Should this be the case, consideration
should be given to research and development to demonstrate adequate TRISO performance at high
power density. In addition, it may be that the fission product retention requirements placed on the
TRISO fuel to support gas-cooled reactor operation may be too stringent for liquid-salt-cooled
applications, where any fission products released to the coolant can be extracted using previously
demonstrated technology.

Following fabrication and acceptance testing of the TRISO particles, the next step in the fuel
fabrication process is forming the particles into a suitable matrix for in-core service. Unlike light
water reactor fuels in which the oxide fuel pellet is protected from the reactor coolant water by a
metal cladding, the TRISO fuel could be in direct contact with the gas or salt coolant. Given their
small size (<1 mm diameter), direct contact between the fuel particles and the salt coolant may not be
desirable; therefore, the TRISO particles are usually consolidated into a carbonaceous matrix material
and pressed into a form suitable for the particular reactor design. Typical forms are pebbles

A-5
(Germany, China), right circular cylinders (United States), or annular cylinders (Japan); however,
other forms, including cruciform, curved plates, and planks, could be envisioned. Whatever the final
form, the method currently preferred for preparing the core particles for molding is to first apply a
thin layer of a matrix precursor material to the TRISO particle and then compress the overcoated fuel
particles into the desired shape. The overcoat performs two functions: (1) it distributes compacting
forces to minimize the probability of fracturing the TRISO particle during the compacting process,
and (2) it controls the loading fraction of the nuclear material.

The matrix for the NGNP fuel 1s a mixture of graphite and a binding material (thermosetting
resin) that is deformable at processing temperatures (room temperature to ~-150°C depending on the
resin). To fabricate a cylindrical compact, the overcoated particles are poured into a cylindrical die
and compressed in the axial direction by a single or double acting plunger. The overcoating material
flows into the interstitial spaces resulting in a fuel compact composed of TRISO particles surrounded
by a void-free matrix. The mass of the overcoat 1s carefully controlled to provide the desired matrix
density and packing fraction and hence the fissile loading. The thickness of the overcoat for the
AGR-1 fuel compacts (165 um) provides a packing fraction of 35%. Work by Morris and Pappano
indicated the maximum practical compact packing fraction is most likely in the 40-50% range.*
While recent production level targets have been ~40%, packing fractions up to 50% have been
reported in the literature.* Figure A.2 shows an AGR-1 fuel compact and an annular compact
fabricated by the Japanese for the High-Temperature Test Reactor (HTTR). *7

HTTR annular fuel compact.

To fabricate annular compacts for the SmAHTR, the same graphite-resin matrix formulation used
for the AGR-1 fuel compacts could be used. While the dimensions of the SmMAHTR’s annular
compact are larger than typical HTGR fuel compacts, they are of the same order of magnitude and do
not require any new equipment heyond a new die set; therefore, fabrication is not expected to present
any undue difficulty. Given the paucity of mechanical strength data available in the literature,
measurements of SmMAHTR compact properties should be performed and factored into the mechanical
and fluid dynamics model to ensure in-service conditions do not exceed material performance
capabilities.

As discussed in Sect. 4.3, an interesting alternative SmAHTR fuel design would use TRISO fuel
consolidated into fuel “planks™ approximately 2.8 cm thick by 23 cm wide by 4 m long (Fig. A.3).
While fabrication of this fuel form would provide a challenge due to its large size relative to
traditional HTR fuel forms, incorporation of TRISO particles into a suitable plank is feasible. An
assessment of the fabrication steps required to fabricate a fuel plank (Table A.3) indicates that while
new equipment would be required, the fabrication steps are expected to be very similar to those of
other fuel forms. Owing to the large fuel plank dimensions; lack of mechanical strength data as a

anticipated that handling of the plank would require specialized fixtures.

The development of the plank fuel form and the transition from laboratory scale to industrial
scale can be expected to required the following major steps.

e Install a small-scale vibro-molding station (~1/10 scale).

e Fabricate planks and determine optimal packing fraction to toughness ratio. (NOTE: forming
the plank is one part of the project; ensuring that it does not crack under its own weight
during handling will be the key issue.)

e Characterize planks for broken particles and erosion properties.

e Determine best forming method and “recipe” for strong planks.

e Transition to large-scale equipment; will most likely need a conveyer system between
molding, baking, and final heat treatment.

In addition, fuel form erosion studies are needed to ensure adequate performance in the SmAHTR
fuel configuration. Matrix production and overcoating is already well understood and is being done at
large scale.

APPENDIX B. SmAHTR RELAPS-3D MODEL
APPENDIX B. SmAHTR RELAP5-3D MODEL

B.1 SmAHTR SYSTEM MODEL DESCRIPTION

RELAP5-3D/ATHENA, Version 2.4.2, was used to perform thermal hydraulic evaluations of the
SmAHTR concept. RELAP5-3D"" includes properties for four salts: FLiBe, FLiNaK, NaBF,-NaF,
and NaF-ZrF,. For the calculations presented here, FLiBe is used for the primary coolant and FLiNaK
for the secondary coolant [for the secondary of both the primary heat exchanger (PHX) and the direct
reactor auxiliary cooling system (DRACS)].

The RELLAP5-3D nodalization of the primary system is shown in Fig. B.1. A cross section of the
various core designs was presented in Sect. 4.3. Each of the core designs was divided radially into
three rings with 1, 6, and 12 assemblies (volumes 116, 117, and 118) moving from the core centerline
to the outer radius. Each ring had an assumed radial and axial (cosine) power distribution. A flat
radial power profile has also been used in some of the models.

The primary system includes the lower plenum (volume 110); upper plenum (volume 125); top
plenum (volume 130) with the open gas volume (connected to volume 200); three pumps (Junctions
131, 132, and 133); three PHXs (volumes 140, 141, and 142); three DRACSs (volumes 143, 144,
and 145); and finally, the downcomer (volume 150). The colors in each control volume are indicative
of the temperature of the coolant inside the control volume during normal operation. Yellow is cold
(650°C), and red 1s hot (700°C). The arrows also show the direction of the flow during normal
operation. The flow in the DRACS (reverse flow) 1s up, while the flow in the intermediate heat
exchangers (IHXs)is down.

RELAPS “heat structures™ in contact with volumes 116, 117, and 118 model the fuel pins,
graphite pins, and graphite blocks within the reactor core. Heat structures in contact with
volumes 140, 141, and 142 model the PHXs. Finally, the DRACS heat exchangers are the heat
structures in contact with volumes 143, 144, and 145.

The different fuel designs were modeled by changing the hydraulic volumes 116, 117, and 118
and the respective heat structures in contact with them (modeling fuel and graphite pins and
reflector/moderator). The three different fuels analyzed (cylindrical pins, annular pins, and plates)
have been modeled separately. For the annular fuel, two channels representing the inside and the
outside of the annulus were required for each ring for a total of six parallel channels in the core. The
RELAPS nodalization for the annular fuel 1s shown in Fig. B.2. The remainder of the model for
annular fuel 1s the same as Fig. B.1.

Secondary systems (or intermediate loops) were also modeled for each of the three PHXs and for
each of the three DRACSs. Furthermore, each DRACS loop is connected to an air cooler; the DRACS
loop and the air cooler are also represented in the RELLAPS5-3D model.

Figure B.3 is an isometric view of the primary system model generated by the RELLAP-3D
graphics processor showing the temperatures of the coolant in the outside volumes of the vessel
during normal operation. The top plenum, PHXs, downcomer, and lower plenum can be seen in the
figure. The coolant temperature 1s hotter at the top (at 700°C), decreasing as the coolant goes through
the PHXs, and is constant at the temperature of 650°C in the downcomer and in the lower plenum.
The larger diameters of the lower plenum and the top plenum in Fig. B.3 are artifacts of the larger
horizontal flow areas of those two volumes when compared to the smaller horizontal flow areas of the
PHX and downcomer. Also, the hemispherical lower plenum volume must be represented as a
cylinder in the RELAP-3D model.
