STABILITY ANALYSIS OF THE MOLTEN-SALT
REACTOR EXPERIMENT

S. J. Ball T. W. Kerlin

Abstract

A detalled analys1s shows that the Molten-Salt Reactor
Experiment is inherently stable. It has sluggish transient
response at low power, but this creates no safety or opera-
tional problems. The study included analysis of the tran-
sient response, frequency response, and pole configuration.
The effects of changes in the mathematical model for the
system and in the characteristic parameters were studied.

A systematic analysis was also made to find the set of
parameters, within the estimated uncertainty range of the
design values, that gives the least stable condition. The
system was found to be inherently stable for this condition,
as well as for the design condition.

The system stability was underestimated in earlier
studies of MSRE transient behavior. This was partly due to
the approximate model previously used. The estimates of
the values for the system parameters in the earlier studies
also led to less stable predictions than current best values.

The stability increases as the power level increases and
is largely determined by the relative reactivity contribu-
tions of the prompt feedback and the delayed feedback. The
large heat cgpacities of system components, low heat transfer

- coefficients, and fuel c1rculat10n cause the delayed reac-
t1v1ty feedback.

1. Introduction

‘Investigations of inherent stability constitute an essential part of

- a reactorrevaluationQ; ThlS 1s partlcularly true for a new type of system,
7'sucﬁ‘as the MSRE. The flrst con31derat10n in such an ana1y31s is to de-
eetermlne whether the system possesses 1nherent self—destructlon tendencies.

'iiLOther less 1mportant’but 51gn1f1cant con31derat10ns are the influence of
'rlnherent characterlstlcs on control system requlrements and the pos31—

éb111ty of conductlng experiments that require constant condltlons for ex-

tended perlods.

 
 

-

Several spproaches may be used for stability analysis. A complete
studyrof power reactor dynamics wouid take into account the inherent non-
linearity of the reactivity feedback. It is not difficult to calculate
- the transient response of nonlinear systemS'with analog or digital com-
puters. On the other hand, it is not currently possible to study the
stablllty of multlcomponent nonlinear systems in a general fashion. The
usual method is to 11nearlze the feedback terms in the system equatlons
and use the well-developed methods of 11near-feedback theory for stablllty
analysis. ThlS leads to the use of the frequency response (Bode plots or
Nyquist plots) or root locus for stability analysis. This study 1nc1uded
nonlinear tran51ent-response calculations and linearized frequency-response
and root-locus calculations.

The stability of a dynamic system can depend on a delicate balance
of the effects of many components. This balance may be altered by changes
in the mathematical model for the system or by changes in the values of
the parameters that characterize the system. Since neither perfect models
nor exact parameters can be obtained, the effect of changes in each of
these on predicted stability should be determined, as was done'in this
study.

- The transient and frequency responses obtained in a stability analy-
sis are also needed for comparison with results of dynamic tests on the
system. The dynamic tests may indicate that modifications in the theo-
retical model or in the design data are needed. Such modifications can
provide a confirmed model that may be used for interpreting any changes
possibly observed in the MSRE dynamic behavior in subsequent operation
and for predicting, with confidence, the stability of other similar

systems.

2. Description of the MSRE -

The MSRE is a graphite-moderated, circulating-fuel reactor with fluo-
ride ealts of uranium, lithium, beryllium, and zirconium as the fuel..l
The basic flow diagram is shown in Fig. 1. The molten fuel-bearing salt
enters the core matrix at the bottom and passes up through the core in

channels machined out of 2-in. graphite blocks. The 10 Mw of heat

generated in the fuel and transferred from the graphite raises the fuel
temperature from 1175°F at the inlet to 1225°F at the outlet. When the
system operates at lower power, the flow rate is the Sameras at 10 Mw,
and the temperature rise through the core decreases. The hot fuel salt
travels to the primary heat exchanger, where it transfers heat to a non-
fueled secondary salt before reentering the core. The heated secondary
salt travels to an air-cooled radiator before returning to the primary
heat exchanger. | | ' |
Dynamically, the two most important characteristics of the MSRE are
that the core is heéerogeneous and that the fuel circulates. Since this
combination of important characteristics is uncommon, a detailed study
of stability was required. The fuel circulation acts to reduce the ef-
fective delayed-neutron fraction;rto reduce the rate of fuel temperature
change during a power change, and to introduce delayed fuel-temperature
and neutron-production effects. The heterogeneity introduces a delayed

feedback effect due to graphite temperature changes.

The MSRE also has a large ratio of heat capacity to power production.

This indicates that temperatures will change slowly with power changes.
This also suggests that the effects of the negative temperature coeffi-
cients will appear slowly, and the system will be sluggish. This type
of behavior, which is more pronounced at low power, is evident in the
results of this study.

Another factor that contributes to the sluggish time response is the
heat sink — the air radiator. An approximate time constant for heating

and cooling the entire primary and secondary system was found by consider-

ing all the salt, graphite, and metal as one lumped heat capacity that
dumps heat through a resistance into the air (eink), as indicated in Fig.
2. TFor the reactor operating at 10 Mw with a mean reactor temperature
of about 1200°F and a sink temperature of about 200°F, the effective re-

sistance must be

1200°F — 200°F

o

Thus the overall time constant is

For the reactor operating at 1 Mw, the sink temperature incresses to about
400°F. This is due to a reduction in cooling air flow provided at low
power to keep the fuel temperature at 1225°F at the core exit. In this
case the resistance is |

This very long time-response behavior would not be as pronounced with a
heat sink such as a steam generator, where the sink temperatures would

be considerably higher.

3. Review of Studies of MSRE Dynamics

Three types of studies of MSRE dynamics were previously made:
(1) transient-behavior analyses of the system during normal operatibnr
with an automatic controller, (2) sbnormal-transient and accident studies,
and (3)ftransient-behavior analyses of the system without external con-
trq}. fThe automatic rod control system operates in either a neutron-flux

control mode, for low-power operation, or in a temperature control mode

at higher powers.2 The predicted response of the reactor under servo éon—

trol for large changes in load demand indicated that the system is both
stable and controllable. The abnormal-transient and accident studies
showed that credible transients are not dangerous.>

The behavior of the reactor without sérvo control was initially in-
vestigated in 1960 and 1961 by Burke.* 7 A subsequent controller study
by Ball® in 1962 indicated that the system had greater inherent stability

than predicted by Burke. Figure 3 shows comparable transient responses
for the two cases. The differences in predicted response are due to dif-
ferences both in the model and in the parameters used and will be dis-
cussed in detail in Section 6.

There are two 1mportant aspects of the MSRE's inherent stablllty
characteristics that were observed in the earlier studies. First, the
reactor tends to become less stable at lower powers, and second, the
period of oscillation is very long and increases with lower powers. As
shown in Fig. 3, the period is about 9 min at 1 Mw, so any tendency of
the system to oscillate can be easily controlled. Also, since the system
is self-staebilizing at higher powers, it would not tend to run away, or
as in this case, creep away. The most objectionable aspect of inherent
oscillations would'be'their interference with tests planned for the re-

actor without automatic control.

 

4. Description of Theoretical Models

Several different models have been used in the dynamic studies of
the MSRE. Also, because the best estimates of parameter wvalues were modi-
fied periodically, each study was based on a different set of parameters.
Since the models and parameters are both important factors in the predic-
tion of stability, their influence on predicted behavior was examined in
this study. Tables 1, 2, and 3 summarize the various models and parameter
sets used. Table 1 liSte the parameters for each of the three studies,
Table 2 indicates how each part of the reactor was represented in the

three dlfferent models, and Table 3 indicates which model was used for

~ each study. . The three models are referred to subsequently as the "Re-
duced," "Intermediate," and;"Complete models, as designated in Table 2.

explicitly (see Appendix A for details).

Prye Laplace transform of a time lag, 7, is e '~. The first

transfer rate between the graphite and the fuel stream on the difference
of their average temperatures. The outlet of the first lump or "well-
stirred tank" in the fuel stream is taken as the fluid average temperaturé.
Thus a dotted arrow is shown from this point to the graphite to represent
the driving force for heat transfer. Hdwever, all the mass of the fluid
is in the lumps, and the heat transferred is distributed equally between
the lumps. Therefore solid arrows.are shown from the graphite to each
fluid lump to indicate actual transfer of heat. '

This model was developed by E. R. Mann* and has distinct'advantages
over the usual model for representing the fluid by a single lump in which
the following algebraic relationship is used to define the mean fuel tem-
perature:

TF inlet + TF outlet

) TF mean = > .

 

The outlet temperature of the model is given by

TF outlet = ZTF mean ---TF inlet .

Since the mean temperature variable represents a substantial heat
capacity (in liquid systems), it does not respond instantaneously to
changes in inlet temperature. Thus a rapid increase in inlet temperature
would cause a decrease in outlet temperature — clearly a nonphysical re-
sult. With certain limitations on the length of the flow path,9 Mann's
model avoids this difficulty.

The reduced MSRE model used one region to represent the entire core,
and the nuclear average temperatures were taken as the average graphite
temperature (TE) and the temperature of the first fuel lump (Efl)' The
nuclear average temperature is defined as the temperature that will give
the reactivity feedback effect when multiplied by the appropriate tem-
perature coefficient of reactivity.

The intermediate and complete models employ the nine-region core

model shown schematically in Fig. 5. - Each region contains two fuel lumps

end one graphite lump, as shown in Fig. 4. This gives a total of 18 lumps
(or nodes) to represent the fuel and nine lumps to represent the graphite.
The nuclear power distributioﬁﬁand nuclear importances for all 27 lumps
were calculated with the digital code EQUIPOISE-3A, which solves steady-
state, two-group, neutron-diffusion equations in two dimensions.

Tests were made on the MSRE full-scale core hydraulic mockup'® to
check the validity of the theoretical mpdéls of core fluid transport. A
salt solution was injected'suddeniy'into“the1200—gpﬁ‘water stream at the
reactor vessel inlet of the mockup, and the response at therreactdr outlet
was measured by a conduétivity probe. The frequency response of the sys-
tem was computed from the time response'by Samlon's method*? for a sam-
pling rate of 2.5/sec. The equivelent mixing characteristics of the
theoretical models are computed from the transfer function of core outlet-
to-inlet temperature by omitting heat transfer to the grgphite and adding
pure delays for the time for fluid transport from the point of salt in-
jection to the core inlet and from the core outlet to the conductivity
probe location. A comparison of the experimental, one—region, and nine-
region transfer functions is shown by frequencyhrespbnse plots in Fig. 6.
Both theoretical curves compare favorably with the experimental curve,
especially in the range of frequencies important in the stability study
(0.01 to 0.1 radians/sec). The relatively large attenuation of the mag-
nitude ratios at frequencies as low as 0.1 to 1.0 radians/sec is due to
a considerable amount of axial mixing, which is to be expected at the
low Reynolds number of the core fluid flow (~1000). This test indicates
that the models used for core fuel circulation in the stability analyses

are adequate.

Neutron Kinetics

 

The standard one-point, nonlinear, neutron kinetics equations with
one gverage delayed-neutron group were used in all the analog and digital
transient response studies. Linearized equations were used for all the
other studies. In the studies of a nine-region core model, weighted
values of nuclear importance for each of the 27 lumps were used to compute

the thermal feedback reactivity. 8Six delayed-neutron groups and the

- Heat Exchanger and Radlator -

The lumplng scheme used to represent heat transfer in both the heat
‘exchanger and the radiator 1s:shown in Fig. 7. As with the core model,
two 1umps are used to represenf each fluid flow path. The.reduced and
 intermediate models both used one sectlon as shown. The complete model

used ten of these sectlons connected sequentlally.

Fluid Transport and Heat Trsnsfér in Connecting Piping

The reduced model used;singie;well-stirredétank approximations for
-fluid transport in the piping from the core to the heat exchanger; from
 the heat exchanger to the core, from the heat exchanger to the radiator,
and from the radiator back to the heat ekchanger. Since the flow is
highly turbulent (primary system, Re m 240,000; secondary system,

Re w 120, 000), there is relatively little axial mixing, and thus a plug
flow model is probably superior to the well—stlrred—tank model. Fourth-

 

order Padé approx1mations were used in the intermediate model and pure
delays in the complete model (see Appendix A). Heat transfer to the pip-

-ing and vessels was also includedein the complete model.

Xenon Behavior

The transient poisoning effects of xenon in the core were considered

only in the complete model. The equations include iodine decay into xe-

' ’,I’

non, xenon decay and burnup, and xenon absorption into the graphite.

Delayed Power
In all three models, the delayed-gamma portlon of the nuclear power

was approximated by a first-order lag.

5. Stability Analysis Results

 

Data were obtained with the best available estimates of the system
parameters for analysis by the transient-response, closed-loop frequency-
response, open-loop frequency-response, and pole-configuration (root
locus) methods. The advantages in using various analytical methods are
that (1) comparison of the results provides a means of checking for com-
putational errors; (2) some methods are more useful than others for spe-
cific purposes; for example, thé pole-configuration analysis'gives a
clear answer to the question of stability, but frequency—responSE methods
are needed to determine the physical causes of the calculated behavior;
and (3) certain methods ‘are more meaningful to a reader than others, de-
pending on his technical badkground. The differences between the results
and earlier results*’ are discussed in Section 6, and the effects of '
changes in the mathematical model and the system‘paraﬁeters are exaﬁined
in Section 7.

The results show that the MSRE has satisfactory inherent stability
characteristics. Its inherent response to a perturbation at low power
is characterized by a slow return to steady state after a series of low-
frequency oscillations. This undesirable but certainly safe behavior at

low power can easily be smoothed out by the control system.2

Transient Response

 

The time response of a system to a perturbation is a useful and
easily interpreted measure of dynamic performance. It is not as ﬁseful
in showing the reasons behind the observed behavior as some of the other
methods discussed below, but it has the advantage of being a physically
observable (and therefore familiar) process.

The time response of the reactor power to a step change in keff'was
calculated. The IBM-7090 code MATEXP'? was used. MATEXP solves general,
nonlinear, ordinary differential equations of the form

where
X = the solution vector,
A = system matrix (constant square matrix with real coefficients),
AA(X) = a matrix whose elements are deviations from the values in A
[thus M (x) x includes all nonlinear effects],
f(t) = foreing funetion vector.

The A matrix was developed for the intermediate model and resulted in a
59 x 59 matrix. | |

The transient response of the neutron level to a step change in k off
of +O Ol% is shown in Fig. 8 for initial power levels of 10 and 1 Mw.
The slow response is evident. Figure 8 also clearly shows that the re-

actor takes longer to return to steady state in a 1-Mw transient than in

. a 10-Mw transient. It is also clear that the power does not diverge

(i.e., the system is stable).

It should be emphasized that this transient analysis included the
nonlinearities inherent in the neutron kinetics equations. The fact that
the results of the other analyses presented below, which are based on
linear models, agree in substance with these results verifies the adequacy

of the linear analyses for small perturbations.

 

Closed-Loop Frequency Response

The closed-loop transfer function is defined as the Laplace trans-
form of a selected output variable divided by the Laplace transform of
a selected input'variablé. If the system is stable, it is possible to
replace the Laplace transform varlable, s, with jw, where j =+/~1 and
w is the angular frequencyrof,a sinusoidal input. A transfer function,
G(w), evaluated at a7particular w is a complex quantity;' The aﬁ@litude
of G(w) physically represents the gain, or the ratio of the ‘amplitude of
the output sinusoid to the amplltude of the input sinusoid. The phase

:~ang1e of G(w) represents the phase difference between the input and out-
"_put sinusoids. A 1ogar1thmlc plot of amplltude ratlo and phase angle as

a fUnctlon of w is called a Bode plot or frequencyhresponse plot.
The,relatlonshlp between the frequency response and_the time response

due to a sinusoidal input is useful conceptually and experimentally. How-

ever, it may be shown that the Bode plot for a linear system also provides

qualitative stability information that is not restricted to any particu-
lar form in input.®? This information is largely contained in the peaks
in the amplitude ratio curve. High narrow pesks indicate that the system
is less stable than is indicated by lower broader peaks.

The closed-loop freguency response was oalculated'for N (neutron
level fluctuations in megawatts) as a function of dk (change in input
k

response calculations; see Appendix C) and the complete model were used

‘The MSFR code (a special-purpose code for the MSRE frequency-

for this calculation. 'Thetresults for several power levels are shown in
Fig. 9. Fewer phase-angle curves than magnitude curves are shown in order
to avoid cluttering the plot. | |

Several observations .can be based on the information of Fig. 9.
First, the peaks of the magnitude curves get taller and sharper with lower
power. This indicates that the system is more oscillatory at low power.
Also the peaks in the low#power curves rise above the no-feedback curve.
This indicates that the feedback is regenerative at these power levels.
Also, since the frequency at which the magnitude ratio has a peak approxi-
mately correSponds to the frequency at which the system will naturally
oscillate in response to a disturbance, the low-power oscillations are
much lower in frequency than the 10-Mw oscillations. The periocds of os-
cillation range from 22 min at 0.1 Mw to 1.3 min at 10 Mw.

Figure 9 shows that the peak of the 10-Mw magnitude ratio curve is
very broad and indicates that any oscillation would be small and quickly
damped out. The dip in this curve at 0,25 radians/sec is due to the 25-

sec fuel c1rculat10n time in the primary loop [i.e., (2r radians/cycle)/

| d(25 sec/cycle) 0. 25 radlans/sec] Here a fuel—temperature perturbatlon

that traveled around the loop.o Because of the negatlve fuel ~-temperature

The relatlvely low galns shown at low frequenc1es can ‘be attributed

- to the large change in- steady—state ‘core temperatures that would result

'from a relatlvely small change iobnuclear power with therradlator air

flow rate remalning constant.” ThiS'meane that only & small change in
power is required to brlng about cancellation of an input 8k perturbation

by a change in the nuclear average temperatures.

Open-Loop Frequency Response

A simplified block diagram representation of a reactor as a closed-
loop feedback system is shown in Fig. 10. The forward 100p, G, represents
the nuclear kinetics transfer function with no temperature effects, and
the feedback loop, H, represents the temperature (and reactivity)'changes
due to nuclear power changes. _ ,

The closed-loop equation is found by solving for N in terms of dk:
= G ok, - GHN
in

or

N G o
8k, 1 +GH ' (2)
in

The quantity:GH is called-the open-loop transfer function, and represents
the response at point b of Fig. 10 if the loop is broken at point b.
Equation (2) shows that the denominator of the closed-loop transfer func-
tion vanishes if GH = —l. Also, according to the Nyquist stability cri-
terion, the system is unstable if the phase of GH is more negative than
-180° when the magnitude ratio is unity. Thus it is clear that the open-
loop frequency response contains information about system dynasmics that
are important in stability analyses.

A useful measure of system.stability is %he ‘phase margin. It is de-
fined as the dlfference between 180° and the open-loop phase angle when -

the gain is 1.0. A dlscu351on of the phase margln and its uses may be

-found in sultable references on servomechanlsm,theory. 13’ For this appli-
- catlon, it suffices to’ note that smaller phase marglns 1nd1cate reduced
1gstdb111ty. A general rule of thumb in automatlc control practice is that

:a phase margln of at least 30° is de51rable Phase marglns less than 20°
':1nd1cate llghtly damped osczllatlon and poor control._ Zero degrees in-
f.dlcates an osc1llat1ng system, and negatlve phase marglns 1nd1cate 1nsta—

= The phase margln as a functlon of reactor power level is shown in

"Flg. 11. . The phase margin decreases ‘as the power decreases and goes below

30° at about 0.5 Mw. However, the phase margin is still positive (12°)
at 0.1 Mw. These small phase margins at low power suggest slowly damped

oscillations, as has been observed in the transient-response and closed-
loop frequency-respohse results. The period of oscillation as a function
of power level is also shown in Fig. 11.

Figure 12 shows Nyquist plots for the open-loop transfer function,
GH, at 1.0 Mw and 10.0 Mw. It is clear that the unstable condition of
(IGH‘ 1 and phase angle —=180°) is avoided. In order for the phase mar-
gin to be a reliasble 1nd1cation of stability, the Nyquist plot must be
"well-mannered" inside the unit circle; that is, it should not approach
the critical (~1.0 +jO) point. Although the curves shown in Fig. 12 be-
have peculiarly in approachlng the origin, they do not get close to the

critical point.

Pole Configuration

The denominator (l-+ GH) of the closed-loop transfer function of a
lumped-parameter system is a polynomial in the_Laplace transform variable,
s. The roots of this polynomial (called the characteristic polynomial)
are the poles of the sYStem_trahsfer function. The poles are equal to
the eigenvalues of the system matrix A in Eq. (1). A necessary and suf-
ficient condition for linear'stability is that the poles all have nega-
tive real parts. Thus, it is useful to know the location of the poles in
the complex plane and the dependence of their location on power level.

The poles were calculated for the intermediate model of the MSRE
(see Section 4). The matrix used was the linearized version of the
59 X 59 matrix used in the:frahsienf analysis. The calculations were

performed with a mbdificatibn’bf'the general matrix eigenvalﬁe code QRl4

~ for the IBM=7090. The results are shown in Flg. 13 for several of the
”,fmajor poles. A1l the other poles lie far to the left of the ones shown
- It is clear fromeFlg 13 that the system is. stable at all power levels.

The set of complex poles that goes to Z€ro as the power decreases is the

' ’jfset prlmarlly respons1b1e for the calculated dynamlc performance- The

imaginary part of thls set approx1mately represents the- natural frequency

of osc111at10n of the system follow1ng a dlsturbance.. The frequency of

0501llation decreases as. the power decreases, as observed prev1ously.

6. Interpretation of Results

Explanation of the Inherent Stability Characteristics

A physical explanation of the predicted stability characteristics
is presented in this section, and an'attem@t is made to explain the rea-
sons for the changes in inherent stability with power level. The reasons
for the behavior are not intuitively obvious. Typically a feedback system
will become more stable when the open-loop gain is reduced. The MSRE,
however, becomes less stable at lower powers. In the discussion of open-
loop frequency response.(Seet. 5) it was noted that the forward-loop
transfer function G represeﬁts the nuclear kinetics (N/8k) with no
temperature-feedback effects, and from the equations (Appendix A), the
gain of G is directly propertional to power level. Thus the MSRE is not
"typical" but has the characteristics of what is known as a "conditionally
stable" system.l’

The MSRE analysis isicomplicated fuither by the complexity of the
feedback loop H, which represents the reactivity effects due to fuel and
graphite temperature changes resulting from changes in nuclear power. A
more detailed breakdown of the components of H is given in Fig. 14. This
core thermal model has two inputs, the nuclear power N and core inlet tem-
perature T 3’ and three outputs, nuclear average fuel and graphite tem-

peratures T? and T¥, and the core outlet temperature Tco' The block "Ex-

2
ternal Loops" reprgsents the primary loop external to the core, the heat
exchanger, the seCOndary?lbop,tand the radiator. All the parameters are
treated as perturbatlon quantltles or dev1at10ns from their steady-state
values. Also the radlator alr flow rate 1s adgusted S0 that with a given
steady-state power level, the core cutlet temperature is 1225 F. This
means that the feedback loop transfer function H also varies W1th power
level., | o _t , | |
If we 1ook at the effect of perturbatlons in power, N, on the core
1nlet temperature, Tc ,rwe can see that the effects of dlfferent air flcw
rates are only apparent at 10w frequenc1es, as in Fig. 15 which Shows
the Bode plots for T /N at Nb 1 and 10 Mw. It is important to note
that at low power and at low frequency, the magnitude of the temperature

change is large, and it lags the input N considerably. For example,

at Np = 1 Mv and w = 0.0005 radians/sec, the magnitude ratio is 170°F/Mw
and the phase lag is 80°. The block diagram of Fig. 14 indicates that

the nuclear average temperature perturbations in T; and Té can be con-
sidered to be caused by the two separate inputs N and Tci' For example,
the open-loop transfer function Tf/N (withTci constant) is 5.0°F/MW at
steady state, and there is little attenuation and phase lag up to rela-
tively high frequencies, as in Fig. 16, which shows the open-loop transfer
functions of the.nuclear average temperatures as functions of N and Tci'
Returning to the example case of Ng = 1 Mv and w = 0.0005 radians/sec,

we note that the prompt feedback effect of 5 F/MW from TF/N is very small
compared with temperature changes of the entire system represented by a
Tci/l\! of 170°F/Mw at —80°. (uote that TF/TCi = 1.0 at 0.0005 radians/sec.)
The important point here is that for low power levels over a wide range

of low frequencies, the large gain of the frequency response of overall
system temperature relative to power dominates the feedback loop H, and
its phase angle approaches —90°. | '

The no-feedback curve;in Fig. 9 shows that at frequencies below about
0.005 radians/sec, the_forward-loop transfer function N/8k (open loop)
also has a phase approaching —90° and a gain curve with a —1 slope (i.e.,
one-decade attenuation per”decade increase in freQuency). With both G
and H hauing phase angles approaching —90°, the phase of the product GH
will approach —180°. If the magnitude ratio of G were such that [GH| = 1.0
under these conditions, the system would approach instability. From the
Bode plot of Fig. 9, it can be seen that at a power of 0.1 Mw, IGH\ 1.0

at- 0. 0045 radlans/sec (22 mln/cycle), since the peak in the closed-loop
’.occcurs there. At lower powers and. consequently lower galns G, lgH | ap-

aproaches 1.0 at even Lower frequenc1es, where the phase of GH is closer
. to —180°. ThlS accounts for the 1ess stable conditions at the lower

L*pcwers and lower frequencles.,

At the higher powers, IGHI approaches 1. O at hlgher frequencles

where the effect of the prompt thermal feedback is s1gn1f1cant For ex-

“ample, the peak in. the 10-Mw closed-loop Bode plot of N/ﬁk Fig. 9, occurs
‘at O.CW8.rad1ans/sec. At thls frequency, IT /NI has & value of 2.0

(Fig. 15) compared with a T%/N_of 4ot at —15° (Fig. 16). Consequently,
the prompt fuel temperature feedback term has a dominant stabilizing effect.

The relative importances of the various components of feedback re-
activity are shown in the directed-line diagrams of Fig. 17 for power
levels of 1 and 10 Mw and at the frequencies at which the oscillations
occur. The vectors labeleqz—ﬁkF and —6kG represent the products of the
nuclear temperature components and the reactivity coefficients that re-
sult from a unit vector inpﬁt 8k, -+ The vectors labeled "prompt" are
the effects due to the nuclear power input based on no change in core
inlet temperature. Those labeled "loop" are caused by changes in core

inlet temperature alone. For example:

The net 8k vector is the sum of the input and feedback vectors. For the
1-Mw case, ok net is greater than Bkin; this indicates regenerative feed-
back and shows up on the closed-loop Bode plot (Fig. 9) as a peak with a
greater magnitude ratio than that of the no-feedback curve.

The increased steblllzlng effect of the prompt fuel temperature term
in going from 1 to 10 Mw is also evident. These plots clearly show the
diminished effect of the graphite at the higher frequency.

_ In both cases, too, the plots show that a more negatlve graphlte

temperature coefflclent would tend to increase the net Bk vector and

‘Thence destablllze the system.

'Interpretatlon of Early Results

_ The prev1ously published results of 8, dynamic study performed in
1961 predlcted that the MSRE would be less stable than 1s predicted in

thls study This is partly'because of dlfferences 1n design parameters

-~ and partly ‘because of dlfferences in the models used. These differences

were reviewed in Section 4 of this report.

The most significant parsmeter changes from 1961 to 1965 were the
values for the fuel and graphlte temperature coefficients of react1v1ty
and the changes in the fuel heat capacity. Table 1 (Sect 4) shows that
the new fuel coeff1c1ent is more negative, the new graphlte coefficient
is less negatlve, and the fuel heat capacity is smaller than was thought
to be the case in 1961 ‘All these changes contribute to the more stable

'behav1or calculated w1th the current data.. (The destablllzlng effect of

a more negative graphlte temperature coefficient is discussed in Section
7.) - |
The most important change, however, is the use of a multiregion core

model and the calculation of the nuclear average temperature. In the

| single-region'core, T¥ is equal to the temperature of the first of the

_ F Pe:
two fuel lumps or the average core temperature (in steady state). In

the nine-region core,.T* is_computed by multiplying'each of the 18 fuel-

| F | |
lump temperatures by a nuclear importance factor, I. In the single-

region model, the steady-state value of TF/N (with T 5 constant) is only
2.8°F/Mv compered w1th 5,0 F/Mw for the nine-region core model. This
dlfference occurs because in the nine-region model, the downstream fuel-
lump temperatures are affected not only by the power 1nput to that lump
but also by the change 1n the lump's inlet temperature due to heating of
the upstream lumps. This point may be illustrated by noting the differ-
ence between two'single-region models, where in one case the nuclear im-
portance of the-first lumptis 1.0 and in'the other case the importance

of each 1ump'is-015 As an example, say the core outlet temperature in-

_creases 5 F/Mw The change 1n T* for a l- Mw 1nput would be .

' As was shown above, the prompt fuel react1V1ty feedback effect was

- 7. Perturbations in the Model and the Design Parameters

Every mathematical analysis of a physical system is subject to some
uncertainty because of two quéStiOns:' How good isrthe mathematical model,
~ and how’accurate_are the values oftheaparameters.used in the model? The
- influence of changes in the assumed model were therefore inrestigatea,
and the sen51t1v1ty to parameter varlations of the results based on both
the reduced and conmplete models was determlned An ana1y31s was also
performed to determine the worst expected stablllty performance W1th1n

the estimated range of uncertainty of the system parameters.

Effects of Model Changes

 

The erfects of changlng the mathematlcal model of the system.were
determlned by comparlng the phase marglns with the reference case as
each part of the model was changed in turn. The follow1ng changes were
made: o | ' |
| 1. Core Representation. A single-region core model was used in-
stead of the nine-region core used in the complete model. |

2. Delayed-Neutron Groups. A single delayed-neutron group was
used instead of the six-group representation in the complete model.

3. Fixed Effective B's. The usual constant-delay-fraction delayed-

neutron equations were used with an effective delay fractibn, B, for each |

precursor. The effective B was obtained byycalculating the delayed-
neutron contribution that is reduced due to fluid flow in'the steady-
state case. This is in contrast to the explicit %reatment of dynamic

The results are shown in Table 4. The only significant effect is
that due to a change in the core model. The results for the one-region
core model indicate considerably less stability than for the nine-region
core modei. This difference is due primarily to the different way in
which the nuclear average temperature of the fuel is calculated, as was

discussed in detail in Section 6.

the results of calculations at the design point and those of calculations
with a single parameter changed slightly. The results of these calcu-
- lations are shown in Fig. 18. Calculations were also performed on the
system with the reduced model with a new computer code calied SFR (Sensi-
tivity of the Frequency Response). This code calculates magnitude and
phase sensitivities for a general system by matrix methods. This calcu-
lation was restricted to the reduced syétem.representation because of
the large cost of calculations for very large matrices. The results of
this calculation are given in Fig. 19. In Figs. 18 and 19, a positive
sensitivity indicatés that-a dééreasé_in the sysﬁem parameter will de- -
crease the magnitude of the ffequency response. The situation is re-
versed for negative‘sensitivitiés.r |

'the'effects 6f posSible futﬁié updating of the MSRE design parametefs
used in this study. 1In addiﬁion, they support other general observations
obtained by other means. For instance, Fig. 19 shows that the sensitivi-
ties to loop effects, such as primary and secondary loop transit times,
are important relative to core effects. This indicates that the external
loops strongly influence the system dynamics, as was concluded in Sec-
tion 6.

Similar information may be obtained from pole sensitivities (or
eigenvalue sensitivities). These are defined as the fractional change
-of a system pole due to a fractional change in a system parameter. The
sensitivity of the dominant pole (the pole whose position in the complex
plane determines the main characteristics of the dynamic béhavior) is
usually the only one of interest.

The dominant pole sensitivities for a nunber of system parameters
are shown in Table 5 for power levels of 1 and 10 Mw. These results may
be used to estimate the effect of future updating of the MSRE design
~ parameters, and they also furnish some insight as to the causes of the
calculated dynamic behavior. For instance, it is noted that the sensi-
tivity to changes in the graphite temperature coefficient is only about
'one-fourteenth the sensitivity to changes iﬁ the fuel temperature coef-
ficient at 10 Mw. At 1 Mw, the graphite effect is about one-third as (:}
large as the fuel effect. This indicates that a decrease in power level

effect of graphite temperature fgg@bgck.ﬂ It is also noted that the vari-
ous heat transfer coefficients have a much léréér relative effect at 1 Mw
than at 10 Mw; this indicates that the coupling between system components

has a larger influence at low power than at high power.

Effects of Design Uncertainties

 

A new methodl® for automatically finding the least_staﬁle condition
in the range of uncertainty in the design parameters was used. A com-
putef code for the IBM-7090 was used for the calculations. The method
is described in some detail in Appendix D. Thé least steble condition
is found by using the steepest-ascent (or gradlent-progectlon) method of
nonlinear prograrming. . _ ,

The quantity that is maximized is the real part of the dominant pole
of the system transfer function (or equivalently, the dominant eigenvalue
of the system matrix). Less stable conditions are accompanied by less
negative values for the real part of the dominant pole, and instability
is accompanied by a pole with a positive real part. The maximization
involves a step-wise determination of the particular combination of sys-
tem parameters within the uncertainty range that causes the réai'part of
the dominant pole to have its least negative value. If the maximized -
pole has a negative real part, instability is not possible in the uncer-
tainty range. If the maximized pole has a positive real part, instability
is possible in the uncertainty range if all the system parameters deviate
from the design point in a particular way. |

A key factor in the stability extrema analysis is the availability
of the appropriate ranges to assign to the system parameters. The ranges
appropriate for the MSRE were furnished by Engel.17 It was decided to
use a‘wide range on the important nuclear parameters (neutron lifetime,
fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity, and graphite fempérature co=
efficient of reactivity). These parameters were sllowed to range between
two-thirds and three-halves of the design values. All other ranges were
assigned by cons1der1ng the method of evaluating them and the probable
effects of aging in-the reactor environment. The ranges of the 16 system

parameters chosen for this study are given in T&ble76.

The reduced model was used with current parameters for locating the
‘least stable condition in the uncertainty range. This gave results at
a much lower cost than with a more complete nmodel. This was considered
adequate because other calculations showed that the reduced modei_predicts
lower stability than the complete model. The reasons for this were ex-
ploréd in Section 6. Experience with other calculations also shdwed:that
changes in system parameters gave qualitatively the same type of changes
in the system performance with either model. | | |

The set of parameters for the least stable condition is listed in B
Table 7. The least negative value of the dominant eigenvalue calculated
with the reduced model changes from.(u0.0187 + 0.0474 j) sec! at the de-
sign point to (—~0.00460 + 0.0330 j) sec™! at the worst condition for 10
Mw. For 1 Mw, the change is from (—0.00182 # 0.0153 j) sec™® to
(+0.000574 + 0.0134 j) sec. fThis indicates that instability is im-
possible in the uncertainty range at 10 Mw but that the reduced model |
predicts an instability at 1 Mw for a combination of parameters within
the uncertainty range. This condition gives a transient with a doubling
time of about 1/2 hr and a period of oscillation of about 8 min per cycle.

It is evident that the calculated instability at the extreme case
for 1 Mw is due to the inherent pessimism of the reduced model"(sge_Sect.
6). This was verified by using the MSFR code for the complete model with
the pafameters describiné the extreme case. It was found thét the phase
margin for 10 Mw was 75° for the extreme condition (vefSus'99° for the
design condition), and the phase mﬁrgin for 1 Mw was 21° for the extreme
condition (Yersus 41° for the design condition). Thus, it is concluded
that the best available methods indicate that the MSRE will be stable
throughout the expected range of system parameters. |

8. Conclusions

This study indicates that the MSRE will be inherently stsble for all
operating conditions. Low-power transients without control will persist
for a long time, but they will eventually die out because of inherent

feedback. Other studies have shown that this sluggish response at low

puts to the upper (or downstreem) regions are affected by the response
of the lower regions. A block diagram illustrating the coupling in terms
of the transfer functions HI_A(S) is shown in Fig. A.1l.

-Appendix- C. General Description of MSRE
Frequency-Response Code

The MSRE frequency-response code (MSFR)'is written in FORTRAN IV
language for the IBM 7090 computers at the Oak Ridge Central Data Pro-
cessing Facility. This language has builtin capebilities for handling.
complex algebra that result in considerable savinés of programming effort.

MSFR uses transfer function techniques (rather than matrix methods)
to compute frequency response. It exploits the fact that a reactor sys-
tem is made up of separate components, each having a certain nunber of
inputs and outputs, which tie in with adjacent components. The subrou-
tines written for each subsystem were useful in other reactor and process
dynamics calculations. - The MAIN program of MSFR performs input, output,
and supervisory choree, and calls the subroutines. A subroutine called
CLOSED must be written to compute the desired closed~loop transfer func-
tions from.the component transfer functions.

The transfer function approach has several edvanteges over the ma-
trix methods:

1. Input parameters are the physical coefficients of the subsys-

tems, rather than sums and differences. This not only makes generating

'input data easy,_it allows the computer to carry out the sum-difference-

type arithmetic internally. Several matrix type computations for which
the matrix coeffiCiehts'were‘generaﬁed "carefully" with long slide rules
resulted in large errors in the frequency response.

2. The frequency response of dlstrlbuted-parameter models can be
computed exactly with MSFR, whlle most matrlx calculatlons are llmlted

to lumped-parameter models.rigc

3. MSFR calculatlons are much faster. The 7090 can put out between

: ,1000 and 2000 frequency-response pOlnts per minute for the complete

' -model Iyplcal runnlng tlmes for current matrlx calculatlons are much

longer.
_ The matrix technlque has the advantages that spe01a1 programmlng

~is not required for each dlfferent problem, and no algebralc manipulatlons

-;joflthe-equations are requrred. HAlso, matrlx_manlpulatlons can be used

 
72

for optimization calculations, eigenvalue calculations, time-response
calculations, and possibly many'others, all with the same input data.

The advantages of both methods were ekploited in this study.

The following subroutines of MSFR have potential as generally use-
ful packages:
| 1. PWR, which calculates the frequency response (N/ak) of the
" nuclear kinetics equations for up to six groups of precursors, with an
option for including c1rculat1ng precursor dynamics.

- 2. CLMP, which computes the frequency response of & "typlcal" core
region (as noted in Appendix A). Inputs are power and inlet temperature,
and outputs are outlet temperature, nuclear average temperatures, and Bk.

3. COR9, which calculates the overall frequencyaresponses_of the
MSRE nine-lump core model using CLMP outputs. , -

4. LHEX, which calculates the transfer functions of a 1uﬁped-
parameter heat exchanger (as in Appendix A), with an input optioﬁ for
solving for up to 99 typical sections in series in a counterflow con-
figuration. ,

5. PLAG, which computes the frequency response of piping lagé for
an erbitrary number of first-order series lags, & fourth-order Padé ap-
proximstion, or a pure delay, or combinations of these, with heat trans-
fer to the piping.

Figure C.l shows the block diagram used as a guide to compute the
closed-loop transfer functions. Typical outputs of the subroutine CLOSED
are ﬁ/&ﬁ (closed loop), Nyquist stability information, nuclear average
temperatures %;/Sﬁ and %E/Sﬁ, and %co/aﬁ and %Ei/Si'

Several commonly used transfer functions are

Fach of these closed-loop equations can be written as a single
FORTRAN IV statement, so it is a simple inatter to generate different
functions. An option is also available in MSFR to ﬁrint out all the
internal or component transfer functions. FORTRAN;_IV listings, decks,

Appendix D. -Stability Extrema Calculation

For a linear description of a reactor system,_the eigenvalues of
the system matrix must all have negative real parts for stability. A
technique16 was developed that_éystematically seeks out the combination
of system.parameters'that causes the.least stableicondition in the
feasible range (causes the dominant eigenvalue to become as positive as
possible). This technique utilizes a form of the gradient-projection
method to explore the hypersurface that defines the stability index (the
negativeness of the real part of the dominant eigenvalue) as a function
of the system parameters. The upper and lower limits on the expected
ranges of system parameters constitute constraint surfaces that limit
the ares of search on the performance hypersurface.

The real part of the dominant eigenvalue is labeled B. The change
in B due to smell changes in the system parameters, X5 is given by

4R = YB.dX = |VB| 'dk'l cos 6 , | (D.1)
where
d8 = incrementael change in B,
3B S "
vB-el&;-+GZS%2-+ cse

dJ?=eJ_Xm+eng2+...,

a unit vector,

e,

; = angle between the_yectors.

‘Thus the maximum change in B occurs when 6 = O; that is, the changes
infthesystem,parameteré“afe in-théﬂSame vector direction as the gradient
vector. It is therefcre_eipected that the greatest change in B will
occur when the system.pafdmeters change in proportion to.their corre~
sponding elements in'the.gfadientlvector:

ok, es

l

 
 

76

where ¥ is a real positive coefficient whose magnitude is chosen to
insure 'that constraints are satisfied.

| Tt is clear that the calculated velues of the componeni:s of VB are
the key quantities in implementation of this method. The method for
finding VB can be developed from the characteristic equation for the

systém given in determinant form:

D=IA-‘SII=0, - | (DB)

where

A = the systém matrix,
8 = an eigenvalue of A,
I = the unit diagonal matrix.

We now write D with some arbitrary eigenvalue, 8y factored out:

D= (s —-sk) F(s) = 0, (D.4)

where F(s) is & nonzero determinant if s, is a simple eigenvalue. We
differentiate Eq. (D.4) with respect to an element, 8447 of the matrix,

A, and with respect to s:

aD OF(s) Os

S— = (s-—sk)g————F(s)é—k—, a - (.5)
*1J "13 ®13 -
%182 = (s — sk) BFSS + P(s) . (D.6)

We then evaluate Egs. (D.5) and (D.6) for s = s, and take their ratio to
get Bq. (D.7):

The deri%ative; BD/B& 4+ is just the cofactor of 8 5 in [A = 81],

“and aD/Bs is the negative of the sum of the cofactors of dlagonal ele-

ments of [A — sI]. Thus Eq. (D.5) may be written

The derivative with respect to a system pareameter, xz,,is easily ob-
tained from Eq. (D.9), since the following relation holds:

. - | (p.10)

The usefulheSS df:Eq.:(D;iO) rests on the ability to calculate the

_rsystem eigenvalue, k? to glve IA - s I] This mabeé readily accom=-
_'plished by using one of the standard eigenvalue com@utation methods,

guch as Parlett's methodlg or the QR method. 14

The cofactors. in Eq. (D 10) could be calculated dlrectly'w1th a

method such as Gaussian eliminstion. However, this tedious procedure may
be circumvented by application of a useful theorem from matrix algebra.

 
 

 

78

It is known that the cofactors of parallel lines in a matrix with order

'n and rank n -~ 1 are prqportional.2° Since [A — SkIJ is & matrix With
these properties, the cofactor calculation may be simplified. For in-
stance, if the cofactors of the first row and first column of [A — skI]

are calculated, all other cofactors are given by

_ % Oy

i3 vl | (D.11)
Use of Eq. (D. 11) to find the cofactors shown in Eq. (D 10) glves a prec-
tical method for finding the derivatives aﬁ/ax needed to carry out the
gradient-projection step shown in Eq. (D.2). -

Gradient methods ere useful for finding local extrema fbr noniinear
prdblems. However, it nmy'be possible for the surface of B versus sys-

- tem parameters to have many peaks. The only tedhnique currently suiteble
for handling this provlem is to use multiple starts. The computer code
developed to implement this method is set up to use maltiple sterts au~
tomatically.

The procedure for carrying out the maximization from a given base
point is to recalculate the eigenvalues for several new parameter sets
specified by steps out the gradient vector. The point that gives the
system with the largest value of 8 is then used as s new starting point.
This is repeated until a maximum within the constrained set of system

parameters is found.
