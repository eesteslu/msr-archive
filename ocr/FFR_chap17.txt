CHAPTER 17
CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF A POWER REACTOR*

The design of a homogeneous molten-salt reactor of the type discussed
in the preceding chapters is described below. The choice of the power
level for this design is arbitrary, since the 8-ft-diameter reactor core, chosen
from nuclear considerations, is capable of operating at power levels up to
1900 Mw (thermal) without excessive power densities in the core. An
electrical generator of 275-Mw capacity was chosen, since this is in the
size range that a number of power companies have used in recent years.
It is estimated that about 69 of the power would be used in the station,
and thus the net power to the system would be about 260 M.

Two sodium circuits in series were chosen as the heat-transfer system
between the fuel salt and the steam. Delayed neutrons from the circulating
fuel will activate the primary heat exchangers and the sodium passing
through them. A secondary heat-exchanger system in which the heat will
transfer from the radioactive sodium to nonradioactive sodium will serve
to prevent radioactivity at the steam generators, superheaters, and re-
heaters. The fuel flow from the core 1s distributed among four primary
heat exchangers which serve as the first elements of the four parallel paths
for heat transfer to the steam. A single primary heat exchanger and path
18 provided for the blanket circuit.

Plan and elevation views of the reactor plant are shown in Figs. 17-1
and 17-2, and an isometric drawing showing the piping of the heat-transfer
sy=tems 1s shown in Fig. 17-3. The reactor and the primary heat exchangers
are contained in a large rectangular reactor cell, sealed to contain any
leakage of fission-product gases. All operations in the cell must be earried
out remotely after the reactor has operated at power. The principal char-
acteristics of the plant are listed in Table 17-1.

17-1. FUEL AND BLANKET SYSTEMS

17-1.1 Reactor vessel. The reactor vessel and the fuel and blanket
pumps are 2 closely coupled assembly (I'ig. 17-1) which is suspended
from a flange on the fuel pump barrel. The vessel itself has two regions—
one for the fuel and one for the blanket salt. The fuel region consists of
the reactor core surmounted by an expansion chamber, which contains
the single fuel pump. The blanket region completely surrounds the fuel
region, and the blanket salt cools the walls of the expansion chamber gas
space and shields the pump motor. The floor of the expansion chamber is

17-1.2 Fuel pump. The fuel pump is of the type illustrated in Chap-
ter 15 (Fig. 15-3) and is designed to have a capacity of 24,000 gpm. It is
driven by a 1000-hp motor with a shaft speed of 700 rpm. This pump
incorporates three major advanced features that are being developed, but
which are not present in any molten-salt pump operated to date. These
are a hydrostatic lower bearing to be operated in the molten salt, a laby-
rinth type of gas seal to prevent escape of fission-product gases up the
shaft, and a hemispherical gas-cushioned upper bearing to act as a com-
bined thrust and radial bearing. These advanced features are intended
to provide a pump with greater resistance to radiation damage and less
complex auxiliary equipment than necessary for pumps presently used
for molten salts.

the fuel passing through the fuel pump is diverted from the main stream,

mixed with helium from the pump-shaft labyrinth seal, and sprayed into
the reactor expansion tank. The mixing and spraying provides a large
fuel-to-purge-gas interface, which promotes the establishment of low
equilibrium fission gas concentrations in the fuel. The expansion tank
provides a liquid surface area of approximately 26 ft* for removal of the
entrained purge and fission gas mixture. The gas removal is effected by
the balance between the difference in the density of the fuel and the gas
bubbles and the drag of the opposing fuel velocity. The downward surface
velocity in the expansion tank is less than 1 in/sec, which should allow all
bubbles larger than 0.008 in. in radius to come to the surface and escape.
In the Aircraft Reactor Experiment at least 979% of the fission-product
gases were continuously purged by similar techniques.

With a fuel purge gas rate of 5 cfm, approximately 350 kw of beta
heating from the decay of the fission-product gases and their daughters
is deposited in the fuel and on metal surfaces of the fuel expansion tank.
This heat is partly removed by the bypass fuel circuits and the balance is
transferred through the expansion tank walls to the blanket salt.

The mixture of fission-product gases, decay products, and purge helium
leaves the expansion tank through the off-gas line, which is located in the
top of the tank, and joins with a similar stream from the blanket expansion
tank (see Fig. 17-5). The combined flow is delayed approximately 50 min
in a cooled volume to allow a large fraction of the shorter-lived fission
products to decay before entering the cooled activated-carbon beds. The
17-2] HEAT-TRANSFER CIRCUITS AND TURBINE GENERATOR 687

capacity of the carbon beds will hold krypton from passing through for
approximately 6 days, and xenon for much longer times.

The purge gases, essentially free from activity, leave the carbon beds to
join the gases from the gas-lubricated bearings of the pumps. The gases
are then compressed and returned to the reactor to repeat the eyele. Ap-
proximutely every four days the gas stream is diverted from one set of
carbon beds to the other. The inactive bed is then regenerated by warming
it to expel the Kr™ and other long-lived fission products. It will probably
be economical to recover some of these gases; others may be expelled to
the stack.

17-2. HEaT-TransrFir CircuiTs AND TurBINE GENERATOR

The primary heat exchangers are designed to have the fuel on the shell
side and sodium inside the tubes. This arrangement makes full use of the
superior properties of sodium as a heat-transfer fluid and appears to yield
the lowest fuel volume.

The heat exchangers, which are of semicircular construction, as shown
in I'ig. 17-3, provide convenient piping to the top and bottom of the
reactor. The thermal characteristics of the primary heat exchanger, to-
gether with the characteristics of other heat exchangers of the reactor
svstem, are listed m Table 17-2.

The sodium in the intermediate heat-transfer system (see Fig. 17-6) is
heated by the fuel in the primary heat exchanger and is pumped out of the
reactor cell and through the reactor cell shield to adjacent cells, which con-
tuin the secondary sodium-to-sodium heat exchangers and the pump. No
control of intermediate sodium flow is required, so there are no valves and
a constant speed centrifugal pump is used. To permit the sodium to be at
u lower pressure than the fuel in the primary heat exchanger, the pump for
the intermedinte sodium is in the higher temperature side of the circuit.
The secondary heat exchangers are of the U-tube in U-shell, counterflow
design, with the intermediate sodium in the tubes and the final sodium on
the <hell side.

The finul sodium circuit, except for the sccondary exchanger, is outside
the shielded area and thus available for adjustment and maintenance at all
times. The principal problems in this circuit are concerned with the ad-
justment of sodium temperature. Iixcessive thermal strains are prevented
in the steam generator by limiting the temperature of the sodium entering
it, und in the intermediate heat exchanger by the regulation of sodium flows
s0 that too cold sodium ig never returned to it. The hot sodium from the
sccondary exchanger is split into three streams with regulating valves for
control of the relative flows. One stream bypasses the steam system and
goes directly to a blender; the flow in it is, of course, greatest at low power

levels. The other two streams go to the superheater and the reheater, and
are then combined with the bypass flow in the blender. On leaving the
blender, the sodium stream is split again by a three-way valve into two
streams; one enters a second bypass and goes directly to the main pump
and the other enters a jet pump that keeps a large sodium flow recirculating
through the boiler, which is of the Lewis type. The three-way valve is
adjusted, at design point, so that about two-thirds of the flow goes to the
jet pump and one-third bypasses the boiler. At low power levels the valve
would be adjusted to give very low flows to the boiler.

The centrifugal pump in this circuit has two speeds, full speed and one-
fourth of full speed. The low-speed operation provides for better regulation
of the sodium flow at very low power levels.

The turbine selected uses 1800-psia steam at 1000°F with reheat to
1000°1" and is rated at 275 Mw. It is a 3600-rpm single-shaft machine with
three exhaust ends. The turbine heat rate is estimated to be 7700 Btu/kwh,
or 44.39%, cycle efficiency, while 7860 and 8360 Btu/kwh are the generator
and station heat rates, respectively. With 67, of generator output used
for station auxiliaries, 260 Mw is supplied to the bus bar.

placing any component in the cell. The tools will he able to handle any
pump, heat exchanger, pipe, heater for pipe and equipment, instrument, and
even the reactor vessel, and, correspondingly, the components will be de-
signed and located for accessibility and sepuration.

The removal and replacement of components requires a reliable method
of making and breaking joints in the pipe. Cutting and welding of pipe
cections can be used, but in the low-pressure molten-salt system 1t 13 be-
lieved that a flanged-pipe joint (see Section 15-3) may be satisfactory.

All equipment and pipe joints in the reactor cell are luid out so that they
are accessible from above. Directly above the equipment is a traveling
bridge on which can be mounted one or more remotely operated manipu-
lators. At the top of the cell is another traveling bridge for a remotely
operated crane. At one end of the cell is an air lock that connects with the
maintenance area.  The erane can move from the bridge in the cell to a
monorail m the air lock.

Closed-circuit television equipment is provided for viewing the mainte-
natce operation in the cell. A number of cameras are mounted to show the
operation from different angles, and a periscope gives a direct view of the
entire cell.

17-4. MoLTEN-SALT TRANSFER lDQUIPMENT

The fuel-transfer systems are shown schematically in Fig. 17-7. Salt
frecze valves (see Section 15-3) are used to isolate the individual eom-
ponents in the fuel-transfer lines and to isolate the chemical plant from
the components in the reactor cell.  With the exception of the reactor
draining operation, which is described below, the liquid is transferred from
onie vessel to another by a differential gas pressure. By this means, fuel
mav be added to, or withdrawn from, the reactor during power operation.

The fuel added to the reactor will have a high concentration of UF4 with
respect to the process fuel, so that additions to overcome burnup will re-
quire transfer of only a small volume; similarly, thorium-bearing molten
salt mav be added at any time to the fuel system. The thorium, in addi-
tion to being a design constituent of the fuel salt, may be added in amounts
required to serve as a nuclear polson.

For the main fuel drain circuit, bellows-sealed, mechanically operated,
poppet valves (see Section 15-3) will be placed in series with the freeze
valves to establish a stagnant liquid suitable for freezing. Normally these
mechanical valves will be left open. By melting the plug in the freeze line
and opening gas-equalization valves, the liquid in the reactor will flow by
gravity to the drain tank, and the gas in the drain tank will be transferred
to the reactor system. Thus gas will not have to be added to, or vented
from, the primary system.

17-5. F'urL Drainy Tank

For the drain vessel design calculations, it was assumed that at 1200°F
the fuel system volume would be 600 ft3. The design capacity of the
drain vessel was therefore set at 750 ft3 in order to allow for temperature
excursions and for a residual inventory. An array of 12-in.-diameter pipes
was selected as the primary containment vessel of the drain system in
order to obtain a large surface area-to-volume ratio for heat-transfer efhi-
ciency and to provide a large amount of nuclear poison material. Forty-
eight 20-ft lengths of pipe are arranged in six vertical banks connected on
alternate ends with mitered joints (see Fig. 17-8). The six banks of pipe
are connected at the bottom with a common drain line that connects with
the fuel system. The drain system is preheated and maintained at the de-
sired temperature with electric heaters installed in small-diameter pipes
located axially inside main pipes. These bayonet-type heaters can be re-
moved or installed from one face of the pipe array to facilitate maintenance.
The entire system is installed in an insulated room or furnace to minimize
heat Tossex.

The removal of the fuel afterheat is accomplished by filling boiler tubes
installed between 12-in.-diameter fuel-containing pipes with water from
headers that are normally filled. The boiler tubes will normally be dry and
at the ambient temperature of about 950°F. Cooling will be accomplished
by <lowly flooding or “quenching” the tubes, which then furnish a heat
~ink for radiant heat transfer between the fuel-containing pipes and the
low-pressure, low-temperature boiler tubes. For the peak afterheat load,
1 How of about 150 gpm of water is required to supply the boiler tubes.

The design eriteria for this fill-and-drain system are that it always be in
1 ~taudby condition immediately available for drainage of the fuel, that it
be capable of adequately handling the fuel afterheat, and that it provide
doutle containment for the fuel. The heat-removal scheme 1s essentially
~¢li-reculiting in that the amount of heat removed is determined by the
radinnt exchange between the vessels and water wall. Both the water and
the Tuel <ystems are at low pressure, and a double failure would be required
for the two fluids to be mixed. The drain system cell may be easily enclosed
and ~euled {from the atmosphere because there are no large gas-cooling
duct~ or other major external systems connected to it.

17-6. CHEMICAL REPROCESSING METHOD

In this plant it is assumed that the core and blanket salts will be re-
processcd by the fluoride volatility process [1] to remove UFg. The Ul'g
will be reduced by a fluorine-hydrogen flame process [2] and returned to
the reactor core. The blanket salt with its U2% removed will be returned
to the blanket, since the buildup of fission products in the blanket salt will

not be an appreciable poison for many years. For purposes of the cost
study, it is assumed that the spent fuel salt with its contained fission prod-
ucts will be discarded after each processing, and new fuel salt will be pro-
vided. Since several means of recovering the fuel salt appear to be feasible,
this is a conservative assumption. The chemical processing is assumed to
be an integral part of this reactor plant.

17-7. Cost ESTIMATES

All the costs were calculated for a 260-Mw net-electrical-output plant
operated at a load factor of 0.80. An annual charge of 149, was made for
all capital items, other than the uranium inventory, for which a 4% annual
charge was made. It is assumed that the reactor plant components will
have been engineered and developed with separate funds not included in
this estimate.
