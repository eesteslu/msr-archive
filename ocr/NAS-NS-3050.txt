FOREWORD

The Subcommlttee on Radlochemlstry 1s one of a number of
subcommlttees working under the Commlttee on Nuclear Science
within the Natlonal Academy of Sclences - Natlonal Research
Councll. Its members represent government, industrial, and
unilverslty laboratorlies In the areas of nuclear chemlstry and
analytical chemlstry

The Subcommlttee has concerned ltself wlith those areas of
nuclear sclence which involve the chemist, such as the collec-
tion and distributlion of radiochemlcal procedures, the estab-
lishment of speciflcations for radlochemlically pure reagents,
avallabllity of cyclotron time for service lrradlationas, the
place of radlochemlstry 1n the undergraduate college program,
etec.

Thlis serles of monographs hag grown out of the need for
up-to~date compllatlions of radlochemical informatlon and pro-
cedures. The Subcommlttee hap endeavored to present a serles
which wlll be of maximum use to0 the worklng sclentlset and
which contalne the latest avallable informatlion. Each mono-
graph collecte In one volume the pertinent Information required
for radlochemical work with an indlividual element or a group of
closely related elements,.

Anh expert in the radliochemlstry of the particular element
has wrltten the monograph, followlng a standard format developed
by the Subcommittee. The Atomle Energy Commission has sponsored
the printing of the serles.

The Subcommittee 18 confldent these publlcations wlll be
useful not only to the radiochemlset but also to the research
worker in other flelds such as phyelcs, blochemlistry or medliclne
who wishes to use radlochemlcal techniques to solve a epeciflc
problem.

INTRODUCTION

This volume which deals wlth the radiochemistry of
uranium l1s one of a serles of monographa on radiochemlstry
of the elements. There 18 Included a revlew of the nuclear
and chemlcal features of partlcular interest to the radilo-
chemist, a discusslon of problems of dissclutlion of a sample
and countling technlques, and flnally, a cocllection of radio-
chemlical procedures for the element as found in the litera-
ture.

The seriles of monographs willl cover all elements for
which radiochemlcal procedures are pertinent. Plans include
revision of the monograph perlodlcally as new technlques and
procedures warrant. The reader 1s therefore encouraged to
call to the attentlion of the author any published or unpub-
lished materlial on the radlcchemlstry of uranium whlch mlght
be included in a revised versaion of the monograph.

IV. Revlew of Those Features of Uranium Chemistry of Chief

Interest to the Radlochemlst.

A, Metallle Uranium

1. Preparation. Uranium metal may be prepared by several methods:l
the reduction of uranlum oxldes with carbon 1in an arc-melting
furnace; reductlon of uranlum oxldes with magneslum, aluminum,
calclum or calclum hydride; the reductlon of uranlum halldes
wilith alkali or alkaline-earth metals; electrolytic reduction
of uranium halides; and the thermal decomposifion of uranium.

iocdide.
2., Physical properties. Metallle uranlum exlsts 1n three allo-

 

tropic for-rnes:-g-’-:i the orthorhomblc alpha form, stable below
6£63°C; the tetragonal beta form which exists between 663°C and
770°C; and the body-centered cuble form which exlists at higher
temperatures (> 770°C). The physlical properties of the metal
as complled by Graingeri'are given 1n Table X. Because of the
method of preparation, impurlties may be contalned 1n the

metal which alter 1te propertiles. Also, a number of the physl-
cal characterlstics depend upon anisotropic and structural
effects, eg. thermal expansion. Therefore, 1f physical proper-
tles are pertinent to an experiment or design, 1t is besat to
determine them 1ndividuslly for the metal used.

The changes wrought 1n metallic uranium by radletion and
thermal cyclling may be considerable. The results of reactor radla-
tion on the metal are: dimensional 1nstabllity, surface roughening
and plmpling, warplng, high hardness, extreme brittleness, cracks
and poroslty, broadened x-rey diffraction llnes, and decreased

thermal and electwlcal conductivity.é- Thermal cycling growth 1s

elmllar in many respects to that caused by radlation damage.
However, dlfferences exlst, the fundamental difference belng
in the mechanism of growth. (The reader 1s directed to reference

3 for more detalled discusalon of this subject.)

3. Chemlcal propertles. Uranlum 18 8 highly reactive metal. A
potential of +1.80 volts for the half-cell reaction, U - U3 + 3e,
places 1t below beryllium and above hafnium and aluminum in the
electromotive force series.-2 The metal forms 1ntermetallic
compounds with Al, Be, B1, Co, Cu, Ga, Au, Fe, Pb, Mn, Hg, Ni,

uranium tarnlshes to form a yellow and. eventually a black oxide
coating. TFinely divided powder may burn spontaneocusly. In boilling
water, massive uranlum corrodes slowly wlth the formation of uran-
lum dioxilde and hydrogen. The reaction products with steam are
uranium oxide and hydride. The diseolutlion of uranium metal 1s

discussed 1n sectlon IV-F.

Iv-B. Compoundes of Uranium

Uranium comblnea with most elements to form a large number
and varlety of compounds. "Gmelins Handbuch der Anorganischen
Chemie,”é which surveys the llterature through the year 1935,
deacrlbes seversl hundred compounds. Ketz and Seaborgg describe
some of the more recently prepared compounds, princlpally of

organlc character, such as chelates, alkoxldes, amldes, mercap-

fides, and w-cyclopentadlenyl compounds.
The oxldatlion states of uranium in the comblned form vary
from IT to VI. Divalent uranium compounds reported are U0 and
US. Trivalent uranium compounds are more numerous and include

the hydride, nitride, seaqulsulfide, halides and borohydride.

Uranium (III) sulfate UH(SOu)2 has also been reported.-I A

large number of tetravalent compounds are known varylng in
complexlty from the oxide and simple blnary salts to more com-
plicated organic structures. Complex salts such as 3(CN3H6)2003-

U(CO3) 4H20 and E(NH4)2C204 . U(caou)2 * 6H,0 form an impor-

2
tant group of uranium (IV) compounds. Complex salts are formed

also with halide, sBulfite, sulfate, and phoephate lona. Inorgeanic

compounds of pentavalent uranium are UF5, UCl5, ﬁ015 . 80012, 8

UCl5 . PCls,é and UF5 ' xHF.é UOCl3 has been reported as an lnter-

nmedlate compound 1in the chlorination of uranium oxlides with
carbon tetrachloride.l Uranium (V) alkoxldes have been pre-
and UOCl, - EtOH

UF6, UCl6, U03, uranates, and uranyl (UoS*) compounds, Uranyl
compoﬁnds are the moet numerous uranlum compounds and vary in

type from simple salts to complex organic arrangemente. Complex
salts are formed with hallde, lodate, nitrate, carbonate, cyanide,
acetate, oxalate, sulfate, phosphate, arsenate, chromate and

vanadate lons. Tripie acetate salts of the form

where ML 13 an alkall metal (L1, Na, or K) and ML 18 a divalent

metal (Mg, N1, Zn, ete.), are used in analytical separatlions of

uranium. Addltion compounds, such as U02(NO 2CH,COCyH

3)2 3
repregent a large number of uranyl compounds.

9.'

Uranatesa and peruranates are lmporftant in the analytical

chemlistry of uranium. Uranates have the general formula xMIO .

2
yUo., or xMIIO . yU03. They may be prepared by different me‘chods.—s-’--l-9

3

However, in usual analytlcal procedures, they are preclpitated
from a uranyl solution by the addltlion of a soluable metal hydrox-
ide, NH40H, NaOH, Ca(OH)E, etc., The uranates are insoluble in
water but dlssolve 1n acids.

Per'ura.natea§ are formed when uranyl sclutlions contalnling
hydrogen peroxlde are made alkallne. The composltion of the
peruranates depends upon the concentratlon of the slkall and
peroxide. The following groups have been ldentifled:

M2U2010 . xHEO, M2U06 . xHEO, M6U2013 . xHEO, and M4UOB . xHEO.
The peruranates are generally socluble in water. The least soluble
are those of the M2U2010 . xH20 group. The peruranates are
soluble 1n dilute mineral aclds.

Table II liste a number of uranium compounds togéther with
thelir behavior in different solvents. The compounds listed are
primarily bilnary compounds or slmple salts. The order in which
they appear 1s the order in which they may be found in "Gmelins

Triposltive uranium, U+3. Evlidence for the existence of
U*3 comes from the reversibllity of the U(III)/U(IV) couple.
Solutlons mey be prepared by the dissolution of a uranium
trihalide or by the electrolytic reduction of a uranium (IV)
or (VI) solution. Chloride, bromide, 1lodide, perchlorsate
arid sulfate solutions of uranium(III) have been reported.ll
They are deep red 1ﬁ color and unstable, wlth oxidatlion of U+3
to U+4 occurring and hydrogen being evolved. Strongly acidi-
fled Bolutionulg or those kept at low temperaturealg appear
to be more stable.

Tetraposltive uranium, U+4. The exlistence of the T

+i

ion 1n solution has been confirmed by measurement of the

acid lliberated on dlssolving UClu i3 and by solvent extraction
studies of U(IV) with thenoyltrifluoroacetoneli& and
acetylacetone.IEB Uranous sclutions may be prepared by dle-
solution of a water-soluble salt: the chloride, bramide,
lodide, or sulfate; by dlssolutlionh of uranium or a uranium
compound 1n an approprlate solvent, e.g., uranium metel in
gulfuric or phosphorlic acid; or by reduction of a uranyl
solution by chemical, electroochemical or photochemical means.
The Bolutions are green in color. They are stable 1n the
qbsenca of alr but are oxidlzed by oxygen. Uranlum(IV) under-
goes hydrolysis with evidence 1n the flrst stages for the
formation of the mononuclear specles, U0H+3. 13,15-18 Poly-
merlc specles also are formed which apparently are not 1n
equilibrium with the monamer.23:12:19 mietanenil found that

in addition to the monomerlc specles, e polymer of the type
U[(OH)leﬁ"'n could account for the hydrolyseils of urenium(IV)
to good approximation. Table IIT, based primarlly upon the

19
uranyl lon may be reduced by reducing agent&ii or by electro-
chemical or photochemical means. The degree of dissoclatlion
of uranyl salts 1n aqueoue solution varies. Uranyl perchlorate
ie apparently completely d:l.slsoc:‘l.at‘,ed;-:-L-9 whereas, uranyl
fluoride 18 undlssociated and tends to form dimers (see section
on complex lon formation - IV-C2).3§L§§ Hydrolysle of the
uranyl lon has been the subJect of extensive 1nvestigatlon.
Conalderable evldence has been adduced for the formation of
polymeric species of the type Uoz(Uo3)§+.3kEZ According

to Sutton,ﬂg formation of polymers beyond the trimer U3082+
is negliglble. However, the trimer itself may undergo
further hydrolysis with the formation of U308(0H)"', U50g(OH) 5,
and eventuelly anlonlc species.ﬂg&il Ah]:-land,-ltg in hils
origlnal paper, proposed the formation of the monomer UOE(OH)+
as wall as peolynuclear species. In a reappralsal of the

work, Arhland, Hietanen, and S1114n23 stated that there was
no cartain indicatlion of mononuclear complexes being formed.
Rather, the experlmental data was explalned on the basis

that complex lons of the type U02[(OH)2U02]$1+ were formed.
From the data 1t was not possible to distingulsh between a
limited mechanism in which n variled from 1 to 3 or 4 or an
unlimited mechanism in whlch n assumed all integral values.
The authors were lnclined to prefer the latter. I‘&'.r-a'us--:l-'-2
suggesated that reactlons leadlng to the formatlion of polymers
mey have & less poeltive value of AH than the reactlion
leading to the formation of the monomer. Consequently, the
latter process mlight be ldentlfied more readlly at high
temperatures than at room temperature. Thls is apparently

the case as was shown by Hearne and 1.'u'hitc-:-i‘l-g who determilned

the enthalpy change to be 20.8 kecal/mole for the monomerilc
reaction (UO,OH' formed) and 6.7 kcal/mole for the dimeric

+

reaction (U20 formed). Table III summarlzes much of the

2
5

20
data avallable on the hydrolysls of the uranyl lon. Included

in the table are values of the equllibrium constant K., the

12
constant for the formatlion of the monomerlc species. Thils
constant has been evaluated by at least seven groups of
:I.n\'reE;’c.’Lgator's--aégféﬁiﬂg?ﬁg:él excluslve of Hearmne and Whiteié.
The values obtalned agree very well (log *Kl = -4.09 to -4.70).
However, the experimental c:ondj.til.ons-g-és-ng-’-é9 and assump-
tionsgé&iig'used in some of the evaluatlons have been

42

questioned.ﬁé Algo, the re-evaluatlon of Ahrland's— work
already has been mentlioned, and Rydbergil has proposed an
explanation for not detectlng polynuclear gpecles in hils
experiments. None-the-less, one must concur wlth R:grdber'gél
who wrote, "---1t seems remarkable that the same constants
should be obtalned for a filictlve mononuclear hydrolysls
product with different U(VI) concentrations and so different
methods of investigation---."

Complex lon formatlon. The abllity of uranlum to form complex
ions 1n solutionse 1s of conslderable importance 1n its analytlcal
peparation and determination. Hydrolysis, mentloned 1n the
previous section, is but a speclal case of complex ion formatlon.
Numerous complexes have been r-eported.z’-i However, the amount

of quantitative data for the varlous ligands 1s rather llmited

and often contradictory.

Tripositlve uranium. Evldence has been reported for

 

uranium(III) cupfer'rate-éi and uranium(IIT) chloroié complexen.

Tetrapositive uranium. Inorganic complexes of uranium(IV)

 

wnlch have been recognlzed through the Tormation of ccmplex salts

Column one denotes the complexing ligand (L). The notation 1s explained following Table III,

Numeroué organic complexes are formed with the uranium(IV)
lon: the acetate, oxalate, tartrate, malate, citrate,.lactate,
glycolate, etc.iﬁ However, the amount of quantltative data
available on thelr formatlon 18 very meager. Tishkoff-éi has
calculated dlssoclation constants for acetate complexes on the

basis of the oxygenated uranium(IV) ion UO2+

being formed. The

in Table VI. A number of dlscrepanciee appear 1n the deta. For
example, evlidence for some complexing of the uranyl ion wilth

nitratezﬂizgizz and chlofidcsT’Ts’77’105_107ions hes been reported

 

by some 1investigators; but a complete lack of evidence'has been
reported by o‘chers.ég Day and Powerszz have polnted out that the
constants calculated by them are concentration constants rather than
activity constants. Consequently, the small complexing effect may
be caused by. the varlatlon of actlvity coefflclents with a change
in medium. Other investigators, however, who have corrected
their resulta to apply to pure aqueous solutlona have found some
complexing to occur with the chloride ion.éz-"-lgéﬂ'-gz

The type of complex formed between uranyl and fluoride lone
also 1ls subjJect to some questlon. Ahrland and co-workerslggiigi
have determlined equllibrium constants for the formation of

complexes U02F+, Uo,F U0, F, , and UOEFME_ and found no evidence

for the dimerlzation of U02F2 for uranyl ion concentrations less
than 0.1M. Day and Powers,ZI however, found no evlidence for the
formatlion of complexes beyond U02F+; and Johnson, Kraus and
Young:’lé have reported the dimerization of U02F2 in solutions

not very different from those lnvestigated by Ahrland, gE_gl.lgﬂ

Heceou. In more recent work, Moskvlin and Zakharovallg conclude

that complexes may be formed with both 02042 and Hcaou' 1ons and
that the amount of each formed will depend upon its stabllity and
the conditions of the experiment.

The compoaltlon of a complex 1s sometimes declded upon by
comparison with complexee having simllar liganda. For example,

I-Ic‘ilfc-BeJ:-ne.t'}:r'om-,;"--zg in her work with salicylic acld, H,A, and

2
methoxybenzolec acld, HB, wase able to show that complexes of the
type U0, (H,A) (HY) , UO2(H2A)(H+) _5» and U02(HB)(H+) _p Were
formed in the agqueous phase. (The negatlve subscripts indicate
that H™ was eliminated in the formation of the complex;) The
experimental data for methoxybenzolc acld was approximated by
asguming only the complex UOE(B)(OH). For sallcylic acid, the
complexes U02(HA)+ corresponding to U02(H2A)(H+)_1 and
UOE(HA)(OH) or UO,A corresponding to UOE(HEA)(H"')_2 were postulated.
It was not poeslble to distingulsh between the latter two.
However, from Cthe simllarity of the distribution curves found for the
two aclda, it was suggested that the sallcylate complexes are
formed by HA™ ligands.

A vast amount of work other than that listed in Table VII

Solubility studles. A number of uranium salts are

 

soluble in orgenlc solvents. Uranyl nitrate 1s the'notable

example. Ag the hexahydrate, this salt 1s soluble in a

and substituted hydrocarbons.161'16 The followlng generall-

zatlons have been madeléé concerning 1ts solution 1n organlc

Glueckaufiéé has made the phenomenologlcal obeervation
that a plot of the solubllity of uranyl nltrate against the
oxygen-to-carbon ratio 1n the solvent molecule results 1n
a silngle curve for alcohols and ethers; but in a double curve
for ketones; one for symmetrlic and one for asymmetrlic ketones.

Tonization. The quantity (An/constant)* hae been used
by McKay and co-workersléz:lég to estlmate the degree of

lonization of uranyl salte 1n organlc sclvents. By this

criterion, uranyl nitrate 1n concentrations of 0.01 - 1M 1s

substantially unionized 1n water-saturated solutlons of ethers,
ketones, alcoholes and tributyl phosphate? Only 1n saturated
diethyl cellosolve and 1n 1sobutyl alcochol is ilonizatlon 1n
excess of 10%. The large amount of water whilch dlssolves in
the latter solvent may account for this.

In tributyl phosphate, the dissociation of uranyl nitrate
increases as 1ts concentratlon 1n the organlc phase 1s de-
creased. At 10'5E-the salt 1s approximately 40 per cent
dissociated,lég i.e., An/120 = 0.4 Uranyl perchlorate at
this concentration is almost completely ionized.lég Lon
associatlon occurs at higher concentratibns, but elgnificaently
less than for uranyl nitrate. At approxlmately 0.01M, the
assoclation of uranyl perchlorate 1s maximum (An/120 has a
minimum value of —0.1) in the concentration range 107 to 1M,
The lonizatlion of this salt may well be assoclated wlth the
amount of water contalned withlin the tributyl phosphate since
the electrical conductivity 1s decreased by dehydration.lég

Jezowska - Trzeblatowskae and co-wc':rkersEg have measured
the molar conductivity of uranyl nitrate in organlc solvents
that contaln only water from the hexahydrated uranyl saltf*
The conductlvlity was found to be low and to decrease wilth a
decrease of the dlelectric constant of the solvent.

Conductivity measurements of UCl4 iIn methyl aleohol
indicated the salt to be somewhat dissociated.gg- The
‘dissociation was found to increase on additlon of tributyl
phosphate.

Kaplan, Hildebrandt, and Ader=lC have classified into

Solvents tested other than tributyl phosphate: diethyl
ether, dlethyl cellosolve, dlibutyl carbitol, methylisobutyl

-ketone, 1gobutyl alcohol, and lsocamyl alcohol.

The stahllity of the complex depends upon the nature of the
essociated cation as well as the nature of the solvent and
the prepence of water 1n the solvent. The general order of
the solvents with respect to stabillity of the trinitrate
complex 1s: ketone > ether > alcohol > water£1§

The formatlion of chlorouranyl complexes 1n neon-&queous
solvents has been reported by Vdovenko, Lipovskii, and
NikitinssC® The complexes U0201+, U0,CL,, U02013‘ were
formed by the additlion of-pyridine hydrochloride or hydro-
xylamine hydrochlorlide to a solution of uranyl perchlorate
or uranyl chlorlde in dcetone. The Btablllity of the tri-
chlorouranyl complex wae found to be dependent upon the
amount of water present 1n the solvent. A compound wae

For alcohols, the relation

solventa h is very nearly 4.0.16. 167 This hae been inter-

oreted by Katzin®l* to mean that the specles U0, (H#,0),, (NO

ranging from the dl- to the hexahydrate; that these hydrates
are 1n equllibrlum wlith each other-and'are of comparable
stabillty. The latter view ls supported by 1isoplestic
neasurements.izg

Infrared measurements on ethereal and ketonle solutions*
of uranyl nitrate, lndicate two moleculea of water to be
strongly bound to the uranyl nlitrate and the remainihg
water molecules to be more weakly bound.lZZiEIQ

The extraction of uranyl nltrate from an agqueous system
into tributyl phosphate (TBP) causes the displacement of

water from the organle phase.lég The displacement 13 roughly

linear with h being -2.l§§ This 1e 1n agreement with the

formulae TBP'H,O and UOE(NO3)2'2TBP.E§§ Uranyl perchlorate,
however, apparently does carry some water into tributyl
phosphate.lég Whether thls water 1ip assoclated with free
uranyl lone or unionized U02(0104)2 1s undetermined.
Solvation. The isolatlon of solvated uranium salts,
in particular uranyl nitrate,ls reported 1n the 1iterature.§9
163,180-182 In phase studies of ternary syetema: uranyl
nitrate, water, organic splvent, Katzln and Sullivanléi_
have concluded that uranyl- nitrate 1n aqueous solution is
largely hexasolvated, subject to the sctlivity. As organiec
melecules are dissolved, 2,3,4 and perhaps 6 water molecules
may be displeced, depending upon the electron-donor capabllities
of the orgenlc moleculea. The total solvation 1e a functlon

of the actlvity levels of the water and organlc molecules,

If a particular confilguration is stable enough, 1t may survive
as a crystalllne sollid. The particular stabllity of the final
two water molecules 18 in agreemept with the resulta of Ryskin
and co-workerslzz&lzg obtalned through infrared abporptlon
meapurements. The abllity of solvents to dlsplace water 1s

to heat measurements, competes with water almost as well as

The order of solvents with respect to solvate stabllity
1s opposite to that with respect to the stability of the
ftrinltratouranyl complex. Thls Buggests a competitlion be-~
tween solvent molecule and nitrate lon for coordlnatlon

wlth the uranyl 1on.lI;

Feder, Ross and V‘cvgellgi have studled the stabllity of
molecular addltion compounds wlth uranyl nltrate. The com-
pounds were prepared by shaking uranyl nitrate dehydrate wlth
varioug addenda in an lnert solvent: benzene and/or 1,2-
dlchlorcethane. 1l:1 moiecular addlition compounds were found
with uranyl nitrate and ethyl aleohol, n-dodecyl alcohol,
tetrahydrofuran, propylene oxide, mesltyl oxide, tributyl
phoaphate, and N,N-dibutylacetamide. 1:2 compounds were
observaed with uranyl nitrate and acetone, methyl lsobutyl
ketone, cyclohexanoné, ethjl acetate, 2,4-dimethyltetrahydro-
thiopene 1,1-dloxide, B-chloroethylacetate, ethyl chloroacetate,
ethyl cyanoacetate, dlethyl ether, allyl alcohol, ethylene
chlorohydrin, and acetonltrile. Formation constants were

determined from changes 1n the aolubllity of urenyl nitrate.

36
It was shown that the stabllity of the addltlion molecules,
for those addenda having simllar functional groups, was 1in
agreement w%th the base strength of the addend; l.e., the

more s8table the molecule, the greater the base atréngth

df the addend.

The average number of solvate molecules n assoclated
wlth uranyl nitrate 1n 1ts partition between water and
varicus organlec Bolvents* has been Btudled by McKaylgéngg
and co-workere. The value of n was found to vary wlth the
uranyl nitrate concentration of the organic phase. For
most of the solventa studled, n varled between 1 and 4.
For cyclohexane, considerably larger velues were found for
low uranyl nltrate concentratlions.

n-hexane solutions of di-{2-ethylhexyl)-phosphate, HL, as
the specles U02(HL)2L2. As the uranium concentration of
the organic phase 1s Increased, there 1s strong evidence
that polymerlzation occurs.lﬁg Similar-conclusions have been
made by Dyrssenlig on the basls of the distribution of uranlum
(VI) between agueous perchlorate solutilon and dibutyl phos-
phate, HK, in chloroform. In hexone, the species UOE(HK)EK2

and U02K2 have been 1dent1fied.l§2 The extraction of
uranium (VI) by dibutyl phosphate from aqueous niltrate
solutions into benzene has been studled by Healy and Kennedy.-]:gg
In addiflion to the specilesa UOE(HK)2K2, the polyuranyl specles
(UOEKE)erK and the nitrated speciles UOE(NO3)2 + 2HK have been
postulated to explaln the shape of the extraction curve as a
function of nitric acid concentration.

It has been postulated that the formatlon of mixed sol-

vates or solvated chelates enhances the extractlon of uranium
into certaln solvent mixtures. These systems are dlscussed

in a lzfer section on solvent extraction.

IV-D Separation of Uranium

 

A number of review articles have been written on the analyti-
cal chemistry of u::-:amium.é-f-ﬂai-'-iggz-g-99 These, together with many
texts on chemlcal analysels (see, for example, references 201-209),
gerve well a3 guldes to the separatlon and purlfication of the ele-
ment. More specislized surveys have been made by Hechﬁglg on the
quantitative micro-analjsis of uranium-bearing minerals, and
by Law:r*c»lwEsbcﬂl.g-ll on separation processes for the recovery of
nuclear fuels.

Two general technlques are avallable for the separatlon of

uranium. {1) Uranlum 18 removed from solution in the presence

39
of contamlnants by preclpltation, solvent -extractlon or some
alternative method. (2) Uranium 18 kept 1n solutlon and contam-
inants are removed. These techniquee are facllitated by the
fact that uranium i1s reasonably stable 1n two oxidation states,
(Iv) and (VI), and that complex formatlon may be effected to
prevent the removal of elther uranium or contaminant from solutilon.
In the fellowlng paragraphs, the Beparatlon of uranium by
precipitation, solvent extraction, and ion exchange are deacribed
1n zome detall. Reference 18 made also to other methods of separa-
tion: chromatography, electrodeposition, volatilizatlon and

pyrometéllurgy.

18 & member of the third group of elements.* That 1s,
1t 18 not precilpitated by hydrochloric acld or by hydrogen
sulfide in an acidiec solutdon, but 1t 18 preclpitated by
ammonium hydroxide or ammonlum sulfide (see references 204,
206, 208, 213). Unfortunately, for the separation of
uranlum, many other elements also are preclpltated by the
same reagents. However, there exlate a large number of
reagents capable of preclpltating uranlum over a wlde range
of pH. These, combined wlth Judiclous use of the two oxidation
states and/or the complexing abiiity of uranium, mey be used
to provlide reasonably pure uranium deposita.

Preciplitants. With the advent of nuclear energy as a
source of power, numerous preclpltants have been investl-
gated 1n an effort to find one speciflc for the separation
and/or determination of uranium. None have been found to

date. Waregli hag summarlized early work using organlc rea-

aome of the more promlslng onea. Rodden and Warf-ii have

complexing agent of uranyl ion. In ammonium hydroxlde

SodIum peroxide faclllitates the separation of uranium and
other metals with sodium carbonate. The addltlon of the per-
oxide alone to acld solutlions of 1iron, cobalt, rare earths,
titanium, zlrconium, hafnium, and thorium causes thelr precil-
pitation while uranium, 1f present, remalns 1n solution.

Solvent extraction. The solubllity of uranyl nitrate in

 

organlic solvents has long been recognized.lgé The ability
of dlethyl ether to extract thils salt has been used 1in
gystems of anelysis for many years. However, 1t 1s only
within recent yeare (starting in the 1940's) that widespread
use has been made of solvent techniques as a means of
geparating and purlfylng lnorganlc substances in general 289-299
and uranium in particular.191’192’194’197'192’3903305
The conditions under which uranium may be extracted are
many and varled. In the present paper, extraction from
aqueocus solutlon 1a consldered. However, extractlion from

8olid phasesigi::gz and slurriesigi has been lnvestigated

60
and a favorable uranium partition has been found. Conditlons
whlch affect the extraction of uranium from aqueous solutilon
by organic solvent are the composltion of the aqueous phase,
the nature of the organlc phase, the temperature, and the
time of equillbration. In the aqueous phase, such factors
ag uranium, acld, cocmmon anlon, forelgn anlon, and forelign
catlon concentratlon must be considered. The nature of the
organic phase depends upon the type and concentratlon of
solvent and dlluent. If the organlec phase 1s not initlally
barren, lts concentration of uranium, acld, ete., affects
partition.

Becauge of the number of varlables and the large number
of uranlum solvents, one cannot conslder, in a volume of thils
glze, each Bolvent 1n the l1light of each varlable. Indeed,
the behavlioral relatlon between solvent and the afore-men-
tloned varlables 18 known for only a few well-studled solvents.
The purpose of the present paper 1B to provide information
on the condltions best-sulted for the quantitatiﬁe extraction
of uranium or for the separation of uranium from interfering
elements. Thls 18 done as much as possible in graphle or
tabular form.

The solvente are dlvlided l1lnto flve general classlfications:
1) ethers, esters, ketonea, and alcohols; 2) organo-phosphorous
compounds; 3) amlnes and quaternary ammonium selts; 4) carboxylic
aclds; 5) chelating agents. Dialkylphosphoric aclds, eg.,
dibutyl phosphate, are classified as organophosphorusa com-
pounds rather than chelatling agents. Carboxylic aclde are
classifled g8 such,although gome may aleo be conslidered
chelating agente, eg., sallcyllc acid. A number of extrac-
tants may serve also as dlluents or secondary solvents for
other extractants. Such systems are descrlbed under the
primary extractant. For example, a cupferron-hexone system

is described under "cupferron" rather than under "hexone!

61
In the discusslon, the terms "extractant" and "solvent"
are often used Interchangeably. "Diluent" 1s used to describe
a secondary solvent rather than the term "inert solvent." The
cholce of dlluent may appreclably affect the partition of
uranlum. A number of terms that are frequently used are
defined below.

3) one or more double bonds in a molecule increases the

4) primary alcohols are more efficlent than secondary
ones, '

5) the coefficlent of extractlon increases with the
solubllity; but there 1s no well-defined relatlon between

the amount of free Bsolvent, the extractlon of other elements

may be lncreased by the additlon of ﬁetal nltrates of signiflcant
solubllity to the aqueous phase. Thls not only promotes the
extractlion of uranium but also the extractlon of other elements
whose nitrates are soluble 1ln the organlc solvent. In some
cases, nitrates whlch Berve as Baltlng-out agents, eg. thorlum
may also be extracted 1n significant-amounts. The extractlon
of other salting-out agents, eg., ceslum, may be enhanced

by the formation of uranyl trinitrate complexes, I\*IUO_E,(I~103)3.§22

in the agueous phase may serlously Ilnterfere with the ex-
traction of the latter. Chloride, fluoride, sulfate, phos-
phate, and several organlc¢ anions have been studled for
thelr interference. The adverse effecta of these ions may

be minimized by removing them from solution prior to uranium ex-
traction, by complexling the anlons wlth cations of salting-
out agents, or by using an excess of an efflclent salting-
out agent to over-ride the anlon interference. The inorganic
anlons may be precipitated as silver chloride, lenthanum
fluorlde, barium sulfate, zirconlum phosphate, or ammonlium
phoaphomolybdate. Fluoride lon ls complexed by alumlnum

and calcium. Sulfate ion 18 complexed by ferric ion. Large
amounts of sulfate lon are also precipitateﬁ by calclum
nitrate. Phosphate l1on 18 complexed by ferrlic and alumlnum
lons. Calclum nitrate has been used to counteract the effect
of acetate and oxalate. The effect of chloride on the
partition of uranlum may be reduced in the presence of a
Btrong saltling-out agent. Chloride ilon 1s more obJectionable
from the fact that it promotes the extractlion of other elements,
notably iron. In the presence of large amounts of interfering
dona, particularly sulfate and phoephate, 1t 18 advisable to
separate the uranlum from solution prlor to extraction. This
may be done by preclipitation with carbonate-free armonium
hydroxide. The preclpltate 18 dissolved in niltric acld and
the extraction 18 1nltilated. Ferric hydroxlde may be used

to carry trace amounts of uranium. |

Solvent actlon. The partltion of uranyl nltrate ls

reflected in the coeffliclents of extraction of micro ahd
macro amountg of uranlum from highly salted aqueous solutlions.
The partition coefflclent of trace amounts 1s larger than
thaet of large amounts a3 a result of more avallable solvent.
A3 mentioned previously, macro amounts of uranium extract
more readlly from water solutlons or less highly salted
aqueous solutlions than do mlcro amounts. This effect may
be a2ttributed to the saltlng-out abllity of uranyl nltrate
itself.

The extractlon of other elements 1s affected also by
the uranium concentratlon. Hlgh loadlng of the solvent
by uranium reduces the extraﬁtion of less preferred complex.
specles. High uranium loading may be achleved by diluting
the solvent with a secondary solvent 1n which uranyl nitrate
1s 1nsoluble or slgnifilcantly less soluble than in the primary
extractant. Solvenﬁ dilution, 1n general, causes a deorease

because of the Be;ecﬁivity of the extraction. Dlsadvantages
of the method are the high volatility and low flash point
of the solvent and the relatively low dlstribution of
uranium into the solvent.

The nitrate concentratlon plotted 1n figure 9 includes that

after extraction by an equal volume of ether. The latter
contributes only a few percent to the total nitrate concen-
tration in most cases. A notable exceptlon is the iron (III)
point at -1.18M nltrate concentration. In this-instance,.
0.82M nitrate lon 13 attributable to ferrlc nitrate and
the remainder to uranyl nltrate. The niltrate concentration
of the saltling-out agent 1s plotted 1n figure 10, Uranyl
nitrate contributes 1little to the nitrate concentration since
only one gram of uranyl nltrate was used per 100 grams of

Figure 10, Effect of varlious nltrates upon the partition coefficlent
of uranium wlth dlethyl ether.

After V, Vdovenko and T. V. Kovaleva, reference 328.

Conditions: 1 g. U02(N03)2 1n 100 g. of initlal aqueous solutlons;
Temperature, 25°C; and Vo/Va = 1.

observed that the saltlng action of a mlxture of nltrates
could be reasonably predlicted by the followlng method:

The logarithm of a_ for each salt at a glven total

nitrate molarity 1% divided by the total nltrate

molarity. These indlvidual quotlents are then mul-

tiplied by the nltrate molarity of the respectilve

Balts. The sum of the resultling products 1s then

equal to the logarlthm of the predicted partition

coefficlent. .
Hellman and Wolfﬁaﬁ have studled the saltling action of
varlous nitrates 1n the presence of nitrlc acld and thorium
nitrate. Some of thelr results are listed 1n Table IX.
From the data 1t may be observed that (1) thorium nitrate
18 generally & less effectlve saltlng-out agent on a
normality basis than other metal nitrates and (2) the
extractlon of uranlum becomes less efflclent as the amount
of extracted thorium becomes appreclable.

The effect of several forelgn anlons on the extraction
of uranyl nitrate by dlethyl ether 1s glven 1n figure 11331
and Table X.igé Arsenate, molyhbdate, and vandate lons alao
interfere with the extractlon of uranlum. The effect of
these ione may be offset by the addition of ferrlc n;trate
to the solution.33§

The partitlon of a large number of elements between
various aqueous nitrate systems and dlethyl ether 1a8 given
in Table XI and illuetrated 1n filgures 12-14. The lncreased
dlstribution of heavy elements and fiesion product elements wilth
increased niltric acld concentratlion should be noted. For a
selective uranium extraction the nitrlc acld concentration
should be minimal. H;srdeg--32 has recommended an aqueous
phase 0.5-1M 1n nltric acld and 2.5M 1n magneslum nitrate
for the quantitative extraction of uranium by diethyl ether.
Mbre gelective extractlion of uranyl nitrate may be made from
a saturated ammonium nitrate-solution, 0.05-0.1M in nitrlec
acld. The extractlon can be made quanhtitatlive by repeated

contacts with ether.

general survey work (Table VIII), have studled the extrac-
tlon of thorlum and uranium by ethyl acetate, n-propyl
acetate, and l1lso-propyl acetate as a function of the

nitrate concentration of the agueoue phase. It was the
observatlion of the latter groupglé that the extractilon of
uranlum tends to decrease wlth 1ncreasing molecular welight

of the esater. Therefore, only acetates and proplonates
need To be consldered serlously. Increased protactinum
extraction was observed wlth incfeasing length of the

alcohol portion of the ester.ilg It was further observed
that hydrolysls of the ester tends to lncrease the extractilon
of both thorlium and uranium.ilé It was not determined whether
the addition of alcohol or organic acild causes the 1ncreased

extractlon.

was found to vary from 0.17 at 22% UOE(NO3)2 . 6H20 in the
aqueous phase to 0.78 at 43% aqueous concentration. In
laboratory practlce, uranium 1s extracted by the solvent
from aqueous nitrate medla. The followlng conditlons have

been ueed by varlous groups to extract uranium:

Grimaldl and Levine3®2: 9.5 g. of AL(NOg)5 - 9HLO
are added to 5 ml of solutlon approximately 2.4N
in HNOS. 10 ml of ethyl acetate are added and
shaken at least 30 seconds.

5 ml of ethyl acetate are added and vigorously shaken
for 2 minutes. (Used with 20-400 mg samples of U308')

109
Nietzel and DeSesa32l2368. approximately 15 ml of sat-
urated alumlnum nltrate solutlon are added to 3 ml
or leas of sample containing 0.30 to 15 g. of U308
per lliter. 20 ml of ethyl acetate are added and
sahaken for 1 mihute.

Guest and Zimmermanﬁég: To 5 ml of sample contalning
5% concentrated HNO3 by volume, 6.5 ml of hot alumil-
num nitrate solution, having a bolling point of 130°C,,
are added. The resulting solution 1s cooled, 20 ml
of ethyl acetate are added, and the mlixture shaken
for 45 to 60 seconds.

Steele and Tavernerlgg: Approximately 5 ml of aqueous
golution are saturated with alumlinum nitrate. The
resulting solution 1s shaken with 10 ml of ethyl
acetate for 1-2 minutes.

AT.COHOLS

316

Hyde and Wolf="— found alcohols to be only falr ex-

tractanta of uranlum and the extractlon capaclty to decrease

rapldly wlth the length of the carbon chaln. This 18 borne
385

out by the work of Poston, et al. who measured the ex-~-

tractlon coefflecients of uranlum and ruthenlium as a functilon

of alumlinum nltrate concentratlion of the aqueous phase for

Experimental conditions: A salt of the elements tested was
dissolved in 10 ml of HNO (15 + 85). DNineteen grams of alum-
1num nltrate crystals Were added and dissolved. The solutlon
was shaken for 15 seconds wilth 20 ml of mesltyl oxlide. The
extract was washed once wilth 20 ml of alumlnum nitrate solutlon
and analyzed.

hexone and several tertlary alcohols: tertlary amyl alcohol,
2-methyl 2-pentanol; 2-methyl 2-hexanol, 2-methyl 2-heptanol.
Only tertlary amyl alcohol extracted uranium better than
hexone (0.5 - 1.5M Al(N03)3, o.e_n;fmoB) and all four alcohole
extracted ruthenium better than hexone. Ruthenlum was
extracted as well or nearly as well as uranium by the al-
cohols. -

Dilsobutylecarbinol extracts ruthenlum nearly as well
as uranium.igé Thorium and zlrconium-mobium are poorly ex-
tracted. Protactinlum 1as extracted much more efficlently

than uranium.

MISCELLANEOUS SOLVENTS

Nitromethane has been recommended by.Warner-'igg as an
extractant for uranium. It 1s reslistant to oxldation,
Btable to hlgh concentratione of nitric :acid, and highly
Belectlive. The dilstributlon of uranyl nitrate between
nltromethane and water and nitromethane and saturated ammon-
lum nitrate solutlon 1s given 1n figure 3-B. The extractilon
of thorium nitrate by nltromethane from aqueous solution 1is
mich less than that of uranlum. Color tests indilcate that
neither copper, cobalt, iron III), nor chromium nitrate 1s
extracted by the solvent. With dlethyl ether, considerable
amounts of copper nitrate end trace-amounts_of ferrlic nitrate
are extracted. Nitrilc acld enhances the extractlion of uranyl
nitrate by nitromethane. However, above a critical acild
concentration (~5§ Initlal acid concentration with equal
phase volumes at 20°C) only one liquid phase 18 formed.

ORGANOPHOSPHORUS COMPQUNDS. Within recent years, a
large number of organophosphorous compounds have been developed
and investigated as extractants for uranium. These compounds
have-beeﬁ gubdivided in the present paper into neutral and

acldic organophosphorus compounds.

122
NEUTRAL ORGANOPHOSPHORUS COMPOUNDS

Solvents 1lncluded 1n thls category are trlalkylphosphates,
(RO) ;P - O; dlalkyl alkylphosphonates, (RO)RE -» 0; alkyl
dialkylphosphlnates, (RO)REP-a 0; and %rialkylphosphlne oxides
RBP-e 0. The abllity of the solvents to extraédt uranium is
1n the order

(RO)3P-4 0 < (RO,)RP—> 0 < (RO)R,P— O <.RgP- 0.
This 18 also the order of lncreaslng base strengths of the
phosphoryl nygenfigg In Table XVII, the four types of
compounds are compared as extractants of uranium (VI),
plutonium (IV), thorium, fission products, and acids.§§1
It should be noted that although uranium is extracted almost
quantitatively by tributylphosphine oxide (Table XVII), other
elements are also hlghly extracted. 1In fact, in spite of
lower extractlion coeffliclents, tributyl phosphate affords a
better separation of uranium from thorium, plutonium (IV),
and fieslon products under the conditlons listed In Table
XVII than does trihutylphosphine oxide.

Tebles XvItT200:3%9 ong x1x320 115t the atstribution co-
=fficients of uranium and some assoclated elements for a number
of neutral organophosphorus extractants. Simllar informetion
on other solvents may be found 1n papers by Burser,égl Healy
and Kennedy,lgg and 1n numerous ORNL reports. The latter have
peen summarized by Blake, et al.322 and Brown, et alecs2392

OPfA prepared in thls manner was found to be more effectlve in
the extraction of uranium than pure dloctylphosphoric acld by
two orderr of magnlftude. The pure acld was prepared by syn-
thesls, starting from POClB;

In an effort to determine the uranium specles extracted
by OPPA, Grdenic and Korparﬂég have 1solated the species
U(Oct2P207)2. The specles, however, was insoluble in ligroin,

This indlcates U(OctEHP207)4 1s the extractable specles. The

Habashiﬁég has Investigated the extraction of uranium

EEEEE~§EEE§E§E° Anion exchsnge resins commonly used
1n the radlochemical laboratory are the strong base resins
such as Dowex-1l and-2 and Amberlite JRA-410 and IRA-~400.
The capaclty of these resins 1a approximately 2.5 mllli-
equlvalents per gram of resin. Wealk base reslns are also

avallable. However, thelr use is more limlted. These

regins have capacltles ranging from about 6 to 10 milli-
equlvalents per gram of resin.

sSplvey, 95_3;,233 have lnvestlgated varlous factors
such as resin capaclty, resin phase volume anion adsorptilon,
etc, shat affect the sorption of uranium. Trivisonno232
has made a literature survey of factors that influence the
adsorption and elution of uranium by and from strong base
anion exchange reslns. These are similar to the factors
influencing solvent extraction and include, other than
those already mentloned, uranlum concentration, anlon con=-
centration, pH, the presence of other metallic lons and
forelgn anlons, temperature, resln size, poroslty, cross-
linkage, etc.

The varlous systems from which uranium may be adsorbed
by anlon exchange resine are descrlibed below. The resln
may be converted to a particular anionic form by washing
wlth an approprlate solution.

was found. The data presented by W1sh§§§ for the adsorption
of various elemenrts by Dowex-2 ( x8,200-400 mesh) 1s repre-
sented in figure 67. Ward and Welch222 have studled the
distribution of neptunium In varlous oxidation etates be-
tween Amberlite IRA-U00 and hydrochloric acid solutions of
varying concentration. Thelr results show that Np(VI) 1s
atrongly adsorbed at >6§ HCl, Np(V) 1s exponentially
adsorbed from 3M to 6M HC1l (D increases from 1 to 10), and
Np(IV) is simllarly adsorbed from about 6M to 10M HC1 (D
increases from about 2 to 400). Prevot, gg_g;,éﬂg have
investigated the adsorption of U, Pu, Th;,; Pe, Ce,and Zr
" by anlon exchange resin A300D from hydrochlorilc acld solu-
tions ranging in molarity from & to 7. Quantitlies of 7 mg
Pu, 6.9 mg U and 5.9 mg Fe per ml of solutlon and 2 grams
of resln were used 1ln the determination of D. Thelir results
are conslderably different than those shown in flgures 65-67.
The dilstribution coefficlents of U(VI), and Fe{III) are lower
roughly by an order of magnitude. The dlstrlibution coefflcient
of Pu(IV) 1s almost an order of magnitude higher. For Pu(III),
D 1s about 0.1 at 4M HC1l and about 1 at 7TM HCl. Zirconium
adsorptlon 1s simllar to that shown In the figures. Thopium
and cerlum are poorly or not at all adsorbed.

of thorlum, titanlum, and zirconium. The distribution co-

Numerous peparations of uranlum from other elements
are poselble using hydrochloric acld systems. The more ob-
vious ones are those 1in which uranium 1s adsorbed and the
other element is not. Conslderatlon of figure 65, indicates
that uranium can be separated from alkali metals, alkallne
earths, aluminum, yttrium, rare earths, actinium, and thorium
by adsorption as uranium (VI) on a strong base anlon ex-
change resin from a concentrated hydrochloric acid solution.
Trilvalent actinide elements are not adsorbed from hydro-
chloric acld sclutions. Plutonlum 18 eluted as Pu (III) with
12M HC1l eontalining hydroxylamine hydrochlorlde and NH4I,
NHuI alone, or HI. Separatlons may be made by adsorption of
the contamlnating element and elution of uranlium with dilute
hydrochloric acld. For exsample, molybdenum 18 adsorbed ffom
0..1;Il;!I_HCl.,§Ei Bismuth is also adsorbed from dilute (<1M)
HCl.éE&Lé&é Other elemente that show strong adsorption from
dilute HC1l include many of the transition metals, tin,
tellurlium, and polonium.éié Kraus and Mooreiité have effected
the separation of protastinlum and uranium by adsorblng them
from 8M HC1 on a column of Dowex A-1 reein and developing
_the column with 3.8M HCl. Protactinium appeared first in
the eluent, separated from uranium. The uranlum fractlon
contalned; however, a falr amount of protactinium 'tailing'}

Advantage may be taken of the different distribution
coefficients exhiblted by lons 1ln varlous oxidatlon states
to effect thelr separatlon from uranlum. Iron reduced to
ferrous lon by hydrogen 1odide§£1 or ascorblc a.c:Lc:lEl—-|~§ 1s

Nelther Pa(IV) nor Th(IV) 1s adsorbed from 6M - 12.6M ne1.249
The elutlon of Pu(III) by 12M HC1l from strong base anion
exchange resln has already been mentloned. Wish and Rowelléég
have effected the separation of Th, Pu, Zr, and Np from U
by elutlon with hydrochloric acld in a sequence of concen-
trations. The elements are adsorbed on the resin (Dowex-2)
from 12M HCl.  Thorium does not adsorb. Plutonlum 1s eluted
in the trivalent atate wlth 12M HCl saturated with hydroxyl-
amine hydrochlorlde and ammonium lodide. Zirconium is eluted
with 7.5M HC1; neptunium (IV) with a 6M HCl - 5% NH,OH - HC1
solution. Uranium 1s flnally eluted with O0.1N HC1.

Korkisch, gg_g;,ﬁél have separated uranium from tung-
sten by means of anlon exchange. The uranium is adsorbed
on Dowex <1 resin from a solution containing 20% 4M HCI and
80% ethanol (volume %#). Ascorbic acid is used to reduce
any 1iron present. The resin 1s washed with a similar solu-
tion and uranium 1s elufed wilth an ether-saturated 0.1M HCl

solution. No tungsten 1s observed in the final eluate.

Fluoride systems.
'F'a.::':T.sé-lig has reported the adsorptlion of elements from

hydrofluoric acld solutions wlth Dowex-1 anlon exchange
resin (x10, 200 mesh). His resulte are shown in figure

68. Uranlum (VI) adsorption 1s strong from dilute HF
solutions and decreases with lnoreased acld concentratlon.
Separation from elements exhiblting no or strong adsorptlon
from HF solutions may be achleved by.proper salectlon of the
aold concentration. Elements such as Be, B, Se¢, Ti, Zr, Mo,
8Sn, Te, Hf, Ta, W, Re, and Hg have adsorptién curves slmllar
in shape to that of uranium (VI). Separation from these
elements using an HF system should prove difflicult to almost
Impossible, dependling upon the distribution coefficlents 1n-

volved.

a functlon of HF concentration in the presence of O and 0.2M

in megnltude as the HF concentration 1s increased. The pre-
sence of 0.2M HC1l also ocauses a decrease 1n magnitude of

Sulfate systems.

The recovery of uranium from sulfate liguors by anilon
exchange methods 1ls important lndustrlally. Laboratory-wise,
a number of procedurses have been:developed for the determlnatlon
of uranlum that make use of the adsorbablllty of the anioniec
uranyl sulfate complexes. The nature of these complexes has also
recelved considerable studygg&ééé&ééz-(see section on complex ions)-
The distribution of uranlum between anlon exchange reslns and
sulfate mediaz has been reported by a number of 1nvest1gatora.§§§&

a pH dependence (D 1lncreases a8 the pH 1s lncreased from 1 to
L} which decreases as the sulfate concentration is decreased.égi
The distribution coefficlent of uranium between Dowex-1 resin
and O to 1.2N sulfurlc acid solutions 1s one to three orders of
magnlitude greater from 80% ethanol solutions than from aqueous
aaolutil.onaa'..é-lkl

A number of procedures have been developed for the separa-
tlon of uranlum from various elements by anlon exchange in
saulfate solution. These generally lnvolve the adsorptlon of
the uranyl complex from a sulfate solutlion at pH 1 to 2 from
which the foreign element is not adsorbed. After thoroughly
wagshing the resin bed to remove 1lmpurities, urahium is eluted
wilth a dilute solutlon of hydrochlorle, nltrlec, or perchloric

acid. Mixtures of elements that have been or may be separsated

Carbonate systems.

 

Uranium 18 recovered from carbonate leach llquors by anlon
exchange 1in lndustrial operations. Its anlon exchange behavior
1s simllar 1n carbonate solutlon to that in sulfate solutlon.
That 1s, the distribution coefflclent ls decreased with lncreased
carbonate concentration. Thls is i1llustrated 1n flgure 72 for
ammonlum carbonate Bolutions.ézi A Blmllar decrease in D i1s
observed for 1increased sodium carbonate concentration.éég The
distribution coefficlent 1s also decreased by a decrease 1n pH
of the solutlon. The lncrease ln blcarbonate concentration at
the lower pH lnterferes with uranium adsorptlon. Other anlons
such as sulfate, nitrate, and chlorilde may also lnterfere with
uranium adsorption from carbonate solutlon. To prevent gessing
with carbon dloxide, uranium 1s eluted with salt solutiomsrather
than aclds. 1

Vanadiumézg and phosphate and molybdateézg have been separated
from uranium in carbonate solutiona by anion exchange. The im-
purities are adsorbed on the resin together with uranium and
eluted with a 10% Na,CO4 solution. Uranium is eluted with a 5%
NaCl solution.

Separatlons between uranlum and the rare earths (Ce3+,
ce™), alkaline earths (Sro*), alkall metals (Cs*), and tellurium

are posslble uslng Dowex 2-H3P04 syétems. The 1atter.separation
has been used by Wiahégg who loaded a column of Dowex-2 resin
from a 0.1§.H3P04 solution. Tellurium passed through and
uranium was adsorbed. The column was then converted to the
chloride form W1fh cqnéentrated hydrochloric acld and uranium
was eluted with O.1M HCl - 0.06M HF. An alternative method
involved loading the column from cbncentrated HCl. Tellurium
was eluted with 1.ON H;PO, after washing the column with an
alcoholic phosphoric solutlon. The coluhn was then washed wlth
an alcoholic HCl gas solution. Uranium was eluted with a 0.1M
HCl - 0.06M HF solution and.molybdenum with 12M HNO,.
Miscellaneous systems.

Uranyl ion forms an anhlonic complex with acetate 1lons at
pH %4.25 to 5.25. The complex has been adsorbed on Amberlite

Uranium 1s also adsorbed on Amberlite IRA-400 resin as an

and molybdenum are also adsorbed.

Uranium complexed with sulfosallcylic acld has been

Catlon exchange. Although a number of separations of
uranium from various elements have been reported in the litera-
ture, the amount of quantitative data reported 1s rather meager.

Hardyégz has sumarized much of the data avallable on the dis-

222
tribution of uranlum between cation exchange resins and nitric
and hydrochloric acld solutlong. HIs curves are reproduced in
figure T4. Distripution coefficient curves for other actinide
elements: Th, Pa, Np, Pu, are glven for comparison. Prevot,
Eg_glféig have published the distributilon curve for uranium
between catlion exchange resin C.50 and nitric acid solution.
Its shape and magnitude are simllar to that shown for the Zeokarb-
225-HN03 gystem in figure T4. Ishimori and Okunoiég have found
that 1ncreasing amounts of methancl in niltrie acid solution
(0.18M) increase the distributlon coefficient of uranium for
Dowex=50 regin.

The elutlon peak positions of a number of lons including
uranium {(IV) and (VI) are given in figure 75 for varlous hydro-
chloric acid concentrationge. The conditlons under which the
peak posltlons were determined are described in the figure
captlion. Ionescu, et al.§§§ have studled the effect of acetone
on the dlstrilbution of eeveral elemente between catlon exchange
reslns, KU-2 and R-21, and dllute hydrochloric acid solutions.
For fized hydrochloric acld concentrations of 1, 2, and 3%,
maximum uranyl distribution coefficients were found between
60 and BOZ acetone solutions. For 4 and 5% acid solutions, D
was found to be conslderably lower than for the more dilute
acld solutilons.

Ishlmorl and Okun'oﬁ§§ have investlgated a number of catlon
exchange systems other than those already noted. Some of thelr
results, D versus sodlum sulfate, sodium scetate, and oxallc .
acld concentration, are 1llustrated in filgure 76. The adsorp-
tlon of uranium by Dowex-50 from solutions of hydroxylamine
was found to be pH depenhdent. Ap the pH of the Bolutlon was
Increased, a sharp decrease ln D was obgerved between pH 5 and
6. Uranyl ion was not adsorbed by Dowex-50 resin from carbonate
soluftilon.

5. Volatilizatlon. Uranium may be separated from many elements by
fractional distlllatlon of the volatile compound, uranium hexa-
fluoride. This method of separation has been applied to the
recovery of uranium from lrradiated fuel elements. Katz and
Rabinowitzl have reviewed many of the early methods for the pre-
paratlon of UF6: fluorination of various uranlium compounds with
elemental fluorlne or cobalt trifluoride, dlsproportionation of
UF5 whlch results in both UFu and UF6, and the reaoction between
UF, and dry oxygen which results in U02F2 and UF6. The latter
two methods are not very practical from an analytlcal standpolint.
Other fluorlnating agentas that form UF6 Include ceric fluorlde,
manganic fluoride, silver difluoride, halogen fluorides (e.g.,

optlmm condltlionas for the purificatlon of uranium 1n sulfﬁric
acld solutlons wlth a mercury cathode are: electrolyte volume,

50 ml; free sulfuric acld ooncentratlon, 1N; current density,
as high as practicable with the given acid concentration (about
10 amp maxlmum); anode, flat platinum spiral or grid just

making contact wlth the surface of the electrolyte; cathode ares,

232
a8 large as practlcable; stirring, surface of the mercury cathode
18 stirred rather rapldly; temperature of electrolyte, between
25° and 40°C; mercury for the cathode, pure; anlons, chloride,
nitrate, and phosphate i1ons should be absent, or present in
only small amounts.

have been developed 1m an effort to prepare thin, uniform fllms
for alpha and fission counting rather than to separate the ele-
ment from any particular impurity. However, in the work of

In acid systems (oells 1, 2, 3, and &), the transport of sulfate,
nitrate, and chloride ions to the anode results 1ln a removal of
acid and a subsequent increase in pH in the cathode compartment.
The uranium, reduced during electrolysis, 1s precipitated as

U0, or U(HP04)2o In the alkallne system, the transport of so-

2
dium lons 1s also accompanled by a rise in pH in the cathode
compartment and uranlum is again preclpltated as the dloxide or
as a mixture of dloxide and sodlum polyuranate.

The electrodlalytic separatlon of uranium from metals 1n
a complex mlxture has been demonstrated by Willard and F:Lnley.gﬂi
An ammonium blearbonate solution contalning U, Fe, N1, Cu, Cr,
Zn, Al, Mo, Mg, and Na salts, and traoces of other elements was
electrolyzed in a two-compartment cell having a catlon permeable
membrane and a mercury cathode. The solutlon was firset made
the catholyte (electrolyte in the cathode compartment) and elec-
trolyzed. Iron (80%), nickel and copper (95%8), tin, and zinec
were removed from solution by deposition. The blcarhonate solu=
tion was then made the anolyte and electrolyzed at a platinum
anode. All aluminum, molybdenum, ammonium, and sllicon, and some
sodium and megnesium were separated from the uranium by migra-
tlon. Uranium was retalned as the carbonate complex and was
recovered as the oxlde by evaporation of the anolyte.

Other features of the slectrodialytic behavior of uranium
that may be useful in 1ts separation and purification are (1)

the retention of uranium during electrodialysis from & perchloric

234
catholyte ueing an anion selective membrane, (2) the dissolution

and separation of impure UF,, and (3) the feasibllity of .electro-

dlalysis 1n organic solutions. ot

T. Pyrometallu;sicalAprocgsses. Although pyrometallurglical or high
temperature processes have been designed primarily for large
scale recovery of fertlle material from irradiated fuel elements,
some of the methods may find épplication In the radlochemistry
laboratory. Types of pyrometallurgleasl operations that have
received considerable attention are(l) distillation,(Z.) salt

extraction, (3.) molten metal extraction,(d ) oxidative slagging,

(5 ) electro~refining, and(6 ) decomposition of uranium iodide.

These methods have been revlewed by L&l.'.»n:-oe.]rc'.'l.og-:l-'l

l. Plutonium 18 concentrated by vacuum distillation
from molten uranium at 1500-1800°C.

2. Plutonlum la extracted from molten uranlum by salts
such as UF, or MgCl,. Uranium remalns in the metallic
gtate. Plﬂtonium 15 recovered as a hallde salt.

3. Plutonium ls extracted by molten metals, such as
gllver or magneslium, that are immlscible with molten
uranium. Fleslon products are also extracted.

4. Oxldative slagging involves the preferential formation
of the most stable oxldes by a molten irradiated fuel
element 1n a limlted oxygen environment. These oxldes
(rare earths) float to the surface of the molten ma=-
terlal and are skimmed off. Other oxldes diffuse 1into
the crucible and through the slag layer.

5. In electro-refining, uranlum is dissolved anodically
1n a fused salt bath of alkzll or alkaline earth halides
that contaln a uranium compound. Noble metals do not
dlssolve and are deposlted as anode sludge. Uranium
and chemically similar materials are deposited at the
cathode. Alkall, alkallne earth, and rare earth fission
products concentrate ln the salt bath..

6. Uranium 1is recovered as the metal from the thermal de-
composition of UIA. Zirconlum and nlobium are the principal
contamlnants.

" It 18 not the purpose of this sectlon to describe the
techniques involved in pyrometallurglcal processes. The lnterested
reader may consult The many papers presented in "Progress in
Nuclear Energy, Serles IITI, Process Chemistry,” volumes 1(1956)

IV=E Determlnation of Urarilum

The amount of uranium 1n a sample may be determined by
atandard methods of analysls: gravimetric, volumetrie, colori-
metrie, spectrophotometric, e*l:c-,.31LL191"19_5’197’198'200'6)'&5
.Because of 1ts natural radiocactlivity, uranlum may also be deterw=
mined by counting technlques. The appllcablility, ln terms of
mass range, of varlous methods for the determination of uranium
1s glven in Table XxxvIr.222
1. Counting techniques. Principles of alpha, beta, and gamma

counting are considered 1ln review articles by Steinberg,éig

Hanna,éiz Deutach and Kofold-Hansen,éﬂg Crouthamel,éi& and

 

J'a.i‘i‘e:r.g59 All three methods of countlng are appllcable to
the radiometric determination of uranium since both alpha- and
beta-emitting i1sotopes exist (Section IIX). Spontaneous fissilon
half=11ves have been determined for several uranium isotopes:
U232, U234, U235, U236, 0238. These 1sotopes are too long-lived,
however, to make fisslon counting a practlcal method for thelr
determlination. |

Ionization chambers are most commonly used for the detection
of alpha particles. In figures 77 and 78 are shown the alpha
spectra of U235 and U233, respectlively. The spectra were obtalned
with a parallel plate, Frilsch grid ionlzation chamber using P-10
(90% argon, 10% methane) gas. A multl-channel analyzer was used
ln conJunction with the lonization chamber. Both U235 and U233
samples were prepared by volatilizatlon. Filgure 79 represents
the U233 alpha spectrum obtained with a surfacse barfier slllcon
s8olid state detector. Data for this flgure was taken from the
same sample as that for figure 78. It 1s readily apparent from
the.two figures that the solld state detector glves much better

resolution of the alpha groups than does the lonlzatlion chamber.

b 50 pg of U238 gives about 20 cpm at 52%4 geometry. Uranlum-

238 may be detected 1n samples having much lower counting

rates than thls, dependlng upon the physlcal condition of

the sample and the presence of extraneous alpha activlity. For
a thin gource wlth low alpha backggggnd, 1 alpha cpm of uranium
should be readily detected. For U this 1s the equlvalent

cf about 2 ug; for other uranium leotopes, the masa 18 even
less.

The data for flgure 79, however, was taken 1in 1000 minutes. The.
data for flgure 78 was taken in 10 minutes.

Alpha partlcles may be counted also by gaseous, llquld,
plastic, and crystalline scintlllation detectore. The resolu-
tion of these detectors is, 1ln general, less than lonlzation

chambers and their applicatlon more limited. Nuclear emilsions

are used to record alpha activity. Such devices as c¢loud chambers

are generally not used in the radloehemistry laboratory.
Geiger-Mﬁller counters, proportlonal counters, and liquid,
_plastlc, and crystalline scintillation detectors are sultable

. for the counting of B -emitting lsotopes, U237, U23% and U240.

Sodium lodlde-thallium actlvated cryatals have galned wlde-
spread acceptance as detectors of gamma radiatlion. The gamna-
ray spectra of U239, U237, U235, U233, dand a uranium are from
the Belgilan Congo are illustrated 1n figures 80-8B4%,. The speotra
were measured by Crouthamel, Gatrousils, and Goalov:'f.ch-—s-—lt2 wilth a
Y-inch dlameter x 4-inch thick oylindrical NaI(Tl) crystal.

Not only can the amount of uranium in a sample be determined
directly by measuring the dlsintegratlon rates of the various
1sotopes, 1t can also be measured indirectly by determining the
activity of daughter products. For such a measurement to be
meaningful, however, the equllibrium conditlon between the
uranium lsotope and 1ts daughter must be known.

Information on the radicactive decay of the uranium isotopes
1le glven ln Section III. Further information on these isotopes
and thelr daughter products may be obtalned by consultlng the
"Table of.Iaotopes" complled by Stromminger, Hollander, and
Seaborgéél and the references given therein. Volumes 8 (1956),

3 (1958), and 28 (1958) of the "Proceedings of the Internatilonal

Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomlc Energy"” contaln a

number of articles on the radlometrlc determinatlon of uranium.

Several techniques are avallable. The simplest and most quanti-

tatlive 1s the direct evaporation of an aliquot of a sample. The

dietribution of such deposlts are generally not very uniform.

Thie may be improved upon by the addltlon of a spreadlng agent

such as tetraethyleneglycol, TEG. Palntling technlques may be

i1s placed 1n a hot water bath and the temperature kept at about
80°C. A current denslty of approximately 0.1 a.mp/cm2 18 used.
The deposition 1s influenced strongly by the rate of stirring,
current denslty, and presence of forelgn ions.ftﬁt

Vacuum sublimation preovides an excellent means for the
preparation of thin depoelts of uranium. The sublimation of
uranlum acetylacetonate, U(05H702)4, has been used. A more
convenlent method 1s the sublimation of uranlum oxldes. A
uranium salt solutlon 1ls placed on a tungsten or tantalum ribbon
supported between two electrodes. The solution 18 dried by a
heat lamp or by passling a low current through the metal ribbon.
The sample backling materlal is suspended at a sultable helght
above the metal ribbon. A bell Jar 1s placed over the assembled
unit and evacuated. The uranlum 1z volatlilized by increasing
the current through the matal ribbon. The unlformity of the
deposlt depends upon the dlstance between the rilbbon and the
backling plate. The collection efficlency also depends upon
thls distance but in an inverse manner to that of deposit uni-
formity. Usually a compromlse is made between collection

d
efflclency and sample uniformity. Much of the uranium that 1s

247
not collected on the sample plate can be recovered from maskling
pPlates and glass chimneys placed between the filament and backing
ﬁaterial. The collection efflclency may also be improved by
subliming from furnaces so that the beam of uranium molecules

158 directed toward the backing plate. . The furnace 1s heated
lby'electron.bombardment or induction heating.

3. Activation Analysls. In activatiop-analysis, a nuclide

 

irradlated by neutrons, gamma raye, or charged particles 1s
transformed infto a radloactlve nucllde more easlly detected than
the origlnal one. The amount of orlginal materlal may be deter=
mined elther absolutely or comparatively. For an absolute deter-
mination, the crose sectlon of the reaction, the lrradlation flux,
and the disintegration rate of the reaction product must be known
or determlned. For comparatlive analysis, a substance of unknown
‘mass is irradiated simultaneously with & similar substance of
known mass. The positions ol these two subatahces are elther
8ide by slde or, 1f meparated, 1in positlons of like fiux. The
reactlon product actlvities of the two samples are compared to
glve the relative masses of the starting materlala. The com-
pqrative technique 1s, 1n general, much easler to apply. The
uncertalnties of many varlables are elimlnated by relative
measurements. .

Activatlon with thermal -neutrons may be successfully
employed as a method-of analysie for--natural uraniuvm, uranium-
236, and the fissionable isotopes of uranium. Nstural uranium
consists of U238(99.3¢), 123%(0.72%), and U23*(0.0057%).85L The

The amount of natural uranium present in a sample may then be
determlned from the amount of U239, Np23% or Pu239 activity -
formed after 1rradlation. Measurement of the Pu232 activity,
however, requlres elther a fairly large amount of U238, a long
irradiation perlod, or a comblnatlon of the two. The amount of
natural uranium may also be determlned from the flsslon of
uranium-235 elther by (1) fissilon counting the sample, (2) iso-

140 or T6132*’

lating and counting a fisslion product such as Ba
or ﬁ3) measuring the total gamma actlvity 1nduced in the sample
by a short neutron irradiation-éﬁi Thermal neutron lrradiatilon
of U23* results tn U232 and 1s of little value in the determina-

tion of natural uranium.

Neutron lrradilatlion of U236 glves U237, a beta-emmiter
having a half-life of 6.75 da:,r:s.éél It is readlly 1ldentifiled
through its beta decay, assoclated gamma rays, and half-life.
Uranlum-238 irradiated with fast neutrons also produces U237,
U238(n,2n)U237. The cross sectlon for thls reactlon has been
determined with incldent neutron energles from 6 to 10 Mev
and at 16 Mev.éél

Actlvation analysls by flsslon countling 1s of wvalue only
if one fisslonlng nucllide 1s present or if the amounts of other
fissionling nuclides present are known and correctlons can be
made for them. The same 18 true for the lsolation and deter-
mination of fieslon products. Uranlum i1sotopes that are
fissionable with thermal neutrons ﬁogether wlth their thermal

660

neutron fisslon cross sectlicns are:——

y230 25 + 10 barns
ye3l 400 = 300 barns
*The fisslon product nuclldes Ba140 and Te132 are chosen since

they are free from lnterfering reactions and are produced 1n
good ylelds.

249
=32 80 + 20 barns

7233 527 = 4 barns
235 582 + 6 barns
0239 14 + 3 barns*

Other than U235, U233 is the best uranium isotope to determine
by fission counting or flsslon product analysls. Uranlum-232
may posslbly be determined in thie manner. The other lsotopes
are of such short half-=11fe that analysis of thelr own radla-
tions 1s a much better means for their ldentifilcatlon.

Excitatlion functions have been determined for a number of
reactliona wlth charged partlcles or gemma rays incldent on
uranlum lsotopes. These reactlons may be used for activation
analysls. For absolute analysis, 1t should be pointed out that
(1) the cross sections reported are sometimes subJect to con-
slderable error; (2) energy determinations of the incoming
particle or ray are also subject to error; and (3) the reaction
product can often be produced by a number of reactlons. Com-
parative analysls appears to be a much better method for the
determination of uranium. For gamma-ray (bremsstrahlung) activation,
slmiltaneous irradiations in a like flux are falrly easy to
accomplish. The two samples,; unknown and standard, are mechani-
cally rotated In the gamma-ray beam. For charged particle
activatlion, the simultaneous irradiation of twd samples in a
like flux may require some 1lngenuity on the part of the ex-
perimenter.**

are generally made with targets attached to or within the
vacuum system of the accelerator. To maintaln the system's
vacuum requlrements, to coql the samples properly, and to
lrradlate the mamples elmultaneously in a like flux may pre-
gent some dAiffioulty in equipment design.

V. Collectlon of Detalled
Procedures

A prodedure for the determination of uranium may entail
one or more purificatlion steps a8 outllined 1n the preceding
sections. For ex#mple, uranium may be separated from Impuritles
by a serles of solvent extractions with one or more different
solvents. These may be interspersed wlth precipitation and/or
lon exchange methods. The procedures described hereln have
been gathered from .projeet reports, the.open literature, and
by private communicatlon. Only a limlted number are presented.
They have been selected.because they represent many of the
Beparation methode already descrlibed or because they represent
different problems in handling samples: problems of dissolution,
extrﬁction in the presence of hlgh beta=gamma activity, etc.
A number of the procedures described do not make use of the ra-
diometrlc determination of uranlum. The method of separation
in these procedures, however, 1s applicable to radlochemlcal
~analysls and is, therefore,; included. A number of papers and
reports describe, in detall, procedures for the determinatioﬁ
of uraniuym. Thése 8should be noted. The work of Rodden end
Warfgi has frequently been mentloned in this paper. In addl-
tion to procedures for the precipitatlion, solvent extractlon,
volatilizatlon, and electrodeposition of uranium, these authors
have presented a number of selected procedures for the solutlon
of ores and minerals and the separation and determlnation of
uranium. Procedures for the anélyticalldetermination in naturally
occurring materlials have also been described by Rodden and
Trggonning,ééé'Grimaldi, May, Fletcher, and Titcomb,égz Schoeller
emd"P-m»,'ell,i?-92 and in the "Handbook of Chemical Determination

of Uranium in Minerals and Ores."§2§

IROCEDURE 1: Uranilum-237-.

Source: B. Warren, LA-1567 (1953) p. 18.

Editort's note: Uranlum-237 may be separated from fission pro-
ducts, neptunium, and plutonium more easlly by lon exchange and/or
solvent extractlion techniques (see, for example, Procedure 7).

The following procedure 1s, however, an excellent example of
uranium purification by precipltation methods.

l. Introductilon

The significant steps 1n the determinatilon of U237 in ma-
terlials contalning flasslon products, neptunium and plutonium are
the following. Rare-earth, neptunium, and plutonlum actlvities
are removed by appropriate lanthanum fluoride scavenglng steps
in the presence of hydroxylamlne hydrochloride. The latter
reagent serves to reduce both neptunium and plutonlum so that
they may be carried down, and also to complex uranium and pre-~
vent 1ts later removal in lron scavenglng steps. Barlum and
Zlrconlum are preclpltated by barium fluozlirconate scavenglng.
followlng a cycle of ferric hydroxide scavenging and ammonium
dluranate precipltatlion steps, uranium 18 reduced by zlnc metal
in hydrochloric acld medium and precipltated, presumably as
U(OH)u,_with ammonlum hydroxlide. The uranium 1s further purifiled
by alternate conversilons to tetrafluoride and hydroxide. 24.1d
Th234(Ux1) which has grown in from =38 is removed by a zirconium
lodate scavenge and the uranlum 1s converted to ammonium dluranate.
Uranium 1s finally plated from nitric acld hedium onto a platinum
foll. \After flaming of the foll and welghlng, uranium is beta;
counted as U308' Chemlcal ylelds average 50 to 65%. Quadrupli-

cate determinations require approximately 8 hours.

EE&Sor's note: The followlng procedure was uged toUngify

U formed by the second order neutron capture of « The
principal decontamlnating etep 18 the ether extractlon of
urenlum from a reduclng agueous solution. Uranium la further

purified by a number of precipltatlons that are not described
In detall. These, however, are falrly easy to perform.

Irradiation and Chemlcal Procedure

Two grams of depleted uranium (1 part 0235 per 30,000 parts
U238) &as U308 in a small 2g alumlnum capsule was lrradiated 1n
the Hanford plle for 12 hours including time for startup and
shutdown. B81x hours after the end of the irradiation the cap-
sule and 1lts contents were dissolved In nltrlc acld, using
mercuric ion as catalyst for dlssolving the alumlnum. The
uranlum was eXtracted batchwlse, the dlssolved aluminum serving
a8 a salting agent. The ether contalning the uranlum was then
passed through two statlc wash columns packed with 3/32 inch
stalnless steel helices and filled with a solution 10M in
ammonium nitrate, 0.1 M in nitric acid, 0.0l N in ferrous ilon
and 0.1 M in urea. Neptunlum was reduced by the aluminum 1n
the dissolver and by the ferrous lon 1n the wash colummg to an
unextractable oxldation state (Np IV and Np V). Additional
ether was passed through the columns to strip out the uranium.
These operatlone wWere carried out by remote control behind
lead shielding. The lnltial dissolver solution measured roughly
50 roentgens per hour at 8 i1nches. The ether solution emerging
from the second column and contalning the uranlum measured only
about 3 mr per hour at the surface, and most of thils was ether-
soluble iodine fileslon product activity. The uranium was ex-
tracted from the ether into an aqueocus ammonium sulfate solu-
tion and washed several times wlth ether to remove lodlne
actlvity. LaF3 was preclplitated from the uranjl nitrate solu=-
tion after reduction wlth sulfur dloxide to remove any traces

of Np239 which might have come through the ether extractlon.

265
PROCEDURE 2 (Continued)

r

The uranium was further purified by precipitation as dluranate,
sodium uranyl acetate, and peroxide and by a final ether ex-
traotion. Throughout this final serles of purlflcatlons there
was no detectable decrease 1n p-activity; thie 1indicates that
the uranlum was radioactivg}y pure.

Small aliquots of thelfinal uranium solutlon were evaporated
on platinum dises and ignited to U308 to study changes 1in
activity. The remaining uranium solutlon was used for extractlon

of neptunium daughter fractlons.

PROCEDURE 3: Purification of Irradiated U23°,

Editor's note: The present procedure was used 1n an experliment
deséﬁg?d to measure the 525 mal neutron fisslon cross sectlon

of The amount of that can be tolerated 1n such an
experiment 1ls very small.

Two criterla were used in selectlng the purification steps

in the followlng procedure:

1) To obtaln uranium free of fission products and other
extraneous activitles wilithout 1ntroducing contamlnant
normal uranium 1in the procedure.f _

2) The initial part should lend itself easlly to remote

control manipulation.

*The reagents used were carefully purlfied. Thus, the niltriec
acld and perchloric acid were redistilled In a quartz still.

The NH4N0 was prepared from gaseous ammonia and distllied HNO3.

The HCl was prepared by passing HC1l gas into triply distllled

H20, etec.

PROCEDURE 3 (Continued)

Procedure:
A. In Cave
The irradiated uranium oxide (~0.3 mg) was dlssolved in
concentrated HNO, and made up to 2 M 1n HNO; with distilled H,0
to give total volume of about 15 ml. Some Fe'T was added to
keep Pu and Np in +%4 étate; The solutlon was saturated with
NH4N03 and contacted four times with 10 ml portions of ether.
Each contact was scrubbed twlce with 2 L‘.[_HNO3 saturated with
NH4N03o The comblned ether extracts were back extracted three
times wlth 5 ml portions of H20. The'HEO strip wae evaporated to
dryneas and trested with HCl to destroy NH4N03 carried over.
B. Outsilde Cave

The sample could now be handled easlly outslde the cave
wlth a minimum ‘of shielding, moat of the actlvity being dus to
U237. A mass spectrometrlc analysls showed 1t contalned 0.5
welght % of U3/, A flsslon count showed that additional purl-
238

fication was necessary to remove Np formed by (n,y) on Np237
whlch had bullt up during lrradiation.

The sample was taken up 1ln about 0.5 ml 6 N HC1l and put
on a small Dowex-1l column and washed. The Np comes off 1n
6 N HCl. Finally the uranium was eluted with 0.5 M HCl. The
eluate was evaporated to dryness and taken up in 0.2 ml of 5 M
HCl, 0.1 M KI and 0.05 M N2H40H » 2HCl. This was heated at 90°
for 2 minutes, diluted to 0.5 M in HCl and TTA extracted twice
for 15 minutee. The crilginal fraction was washed twice with
benzene and evaporated to drynese. |

In order to clean up the uranium for a mass apectrometric
analysils, 1t was subJected to another ether extraction as in
the first ﬁtep. After the NH4N03 was destroyed the sample was
fumed with HGlOu to destroy any organic resldue from the ether
extraction.

PROCEDURE 5 (Continued)

tltatively separated from largé quantities of dlverse ions by
extraction into methyl 1sobutyl ketone (4-methyl-2-pentanone)
from an acld-deflcient aluminum nltrate salting solutlon. Milll-
gram levels are determined by a direct absofbance measurement
of the trinitrate complex 1ln the separated organic phase at
352 my. Mlerogram amounts are determined by adding dibenzoyl-
methane (1,3-diphenyl-l,3-propanedione) in an ethyl alcohol-
pyridine mixture to the separated organic phase and measuring
the absorbance of the chelate at 415 mu. The coefficlent of
variation 18 less than 1% at the 10-mg. and 25-y levels. The
1imit of sensitivity 1s 0.8 v for the dlbenzoylmethane method.

Apparatus and Reagents

Absorbance measurements of the tetrapropylammonlium uranyl
trinitrate complex were made wilth a Cary Model 14 recording
Bpectrophotometer and l-cm. Corex cellg. A Teflon 9 x 9 x 6 mm.
spacer placed in the bottom of the cells permlits absorbance
measurements wlith 2 ml. of sample. Abaorbance measurgments of
‘the dlbenzoylmethane complex were made wlth a Beckman DU spec=
trophotometer and 5-c¢m. Corex cells.

Extractions were made 1in 125 x 15 mm. teat tubes with
polyethylene stoppers. A mechanlcal extraction device? was
used for agltatlon.

Reagent grade inorganic and Eastman Kodak Co. White Label
organlc chemlcala were used without purlficatlon. Dilstilled
water was used throughout. The uranlum solutions were pfepared
by dlasolving purlfled black oxlde; U308‘ in a slight excees of
nitric acid, and making to volume with water.

The dibenzoylmethahe reagent 1s prepared by dlssolving
0.1140 gram'of dibenzoylmethane in 500 ml. of a 5% solution
(ve/v.) of ethyl alecohol in pyridine.

Abstract
A method 1s described for the determinatlion of uranium in high grade
uranium material. Uranium ls peparated from contamlnants by means
of an ethyl acetate extraction using aluminum nitrate as a salting

agent. After the uranium hase been strlipped from the ethyl acetate

layer by means of water, colorlmetrlc determination of the uranium
is carrled out by the sodlum hydroxlde-hydrogen peroxlde method.
The procedure 1B accurate, rapld, and easlly adaptable to routine

work.

Reagents and Apparatus

Reagents. Ethyl acetate (Merck, reagent grade).

ALUMINUM NITRATE SALTING SOLUTION. Place approximately 450
grams of reagent grade (Mallinckrodt) alumlnum-nitrate [Al(NO3)3-
9H201 in a 600-ml. beaker and add 25 to 50 ml. of distillled water.
Cover the beaker and heat the mixture on a hot plate. If & clear
solutlon does not result after 5 to 10 minutes of bolling, add 20
ml. of water, and contlinue the bolling for 5 more mlinutea. Repeat
this step untll a clear solutlon 1s obtalned after bolling. Remove
the cover glass and concentrate the solutlon by bollling untll a
bolling point of 130°C. 18 reached. Cover the beaker with a watch
glass and elther transfer the solution to a conatant temperature
apparatus or keep the solutlon warm, finally heating to just under
boiling before use. If the solutlion 13 allowed to cool to approxi-
mately 60°C., recrystallizatlon of aluminum nitrate willl take place.
It is neceassary, therefore, to dllute the salting agent solutlon by
about one third ln order to prevent recrystalllization 1f the solu-
tion cools to room temperature. Accordingly, 1f the solutlon 18 to
stand overnight, add 35 ml. of dlstlilled water per 100 ml. of salt-
inz agent solutlion, mlx well, and cover.

If the salting agent solutlon 1s. to be atored, the following
procedure has been found convenlent. AdJjust the solutlon to the
proper concentration (boiling poilnt, 130°C.) and tranafer to a 100-
ml. three-necked reaction flask set on a heating mantle. AdJust the
heating so that the temperature of the solutlon 1e kept at about
110°C. In one of the necks place a water condenser, in another neck

a. thermometer, and Iin the third neck a removable ground-glass stop-

ATLUMINUM NITRATE WASH SOLUTION. Add 100 ml. of alumlnum nltrate
salting solution (boiling point, 130°C.) to 73 ml. of distilled
water and 4 ml. of concentrated niltric acid.

Apparatus. Beckman DU spectrophotometer.

Heating'mantle. .

Three-necked reaction flask (1000 ml.).

Water condenser.

No. O rubber stoppers. Boil twlce 1n ethyl acétate before use.

Sixty-milliliter separatory funnels (Squibb, pear-shaped).

Procedure

Sample Dissolution. Place an appropriate quantity (1 to
5 grams) of the sample in a tared welghing bottle, stopper the
bottle, and welgh the bottle and contents immediately. Carry
out a molature determination on a separate sample 1f uranilum
1s to be calculated on a dpy welght basis.

Bring the sample into solutlon iIn one of three ways: (1)
nitric acid treatment, (2) multiacid treatment, or (3) sugar
carbon-godium peroxide fusion.

For the nltric acld tfeatment, dlssolve the sample in a
sultable quantity of nltric acld and transfer the solution and
insoluble resldue into an appropriate volumetric flask and make
up to volume. Regulate the dllutlon so that the aliquot chosen
for extractlion will contaln between 10 and 30 mg. of uranium
oxlde if the final dllutlon for the colorimetric finish is to
be 250 ml. AdJjust the acldlty of the sample solution to about
5% in nitric acid. |

If nitric scld treatment 1s not sufficient, treat the
Sample wlth hydrochlorilc acld, nltrlc acid, perchloric acld,
and finally sulfurle acid. If necessary, add a few mllliliters

278
PROCEDURE 6 (Continued)

of hydrofluoric acld. Fume the sample to dryness and leach
the resldue wilth nltrle aclid, finally transferring the solution
and resldue to an appropriate volumetric flask and adjusting
to 5% in nitric acld a8 in the glngle acld treatment.

If the sample 1B refrgctory, use the sugar carbon-sodium
peroxlde fusion method described by Muehlbergi. After dilssolu-
tion of the sample 1n thls manner, transfer the acldified solu-

tlon to an approprilate volumetrilc flask and dllute so that the
final solutlon 1s 5% in nltrilc acid.

Allquot solution samples dlrectly or dllute as required for
an gkthyl acetate extraction. If the sample 18 aliquoted di-
rectly for an extraetlon, add 5 drops of concentrated nitriec acild
per 5-ml allquot of sample and standards before extraction. Where
gamples are dlluted before aliquots are taken for extractlon,
adjust the acidlty so that the final volume 1s 5% in nitric ecid.

Ethyl Acetate Extractlon. Place an appropriate aliquot

 

(usually 5 ml.) in a 60-ml. separatory funnel, the stopcock of
which has been lubrlcated wlth sllicone grease. Add, by means
of a graduated pipet, 6.5 ml. of alumlnum nitrate solutlon per
5 ml. of sample solutlon. The aluminum nitrate saltlng solu-
tion should be added while hot (above 110°C.). Cool the solu-
tlon to room temperature and add 20 ml. of ethyl acetate.
Stopper the separatory funnels with pretreated rubber stoppers.
Shake the mixture for U5 to 60 seconds. Occaslonally erystalll-
‘zatlion will take place In the separatory funnel near the stop-
cock. In such a case place the lower part of the separatory
funnel 1n a beaker of hot water untll the solidifled portion
dissolves.

After the layers have separated, draln off the aqueous
(lower) layer. Occaslonally a cloudiness will appear at the
boundary of the aqueous and organlc layer. Thls cloudy portlon
should not be dralned off. Add 10 ml. of zlumlnum nitrate wash

279
PROCEDURE 6 (Continued)

solution to the funnel and agaln shake the mixture for 45 to 60
seéonds. Draln off the aqueouB layer, once again belng careful
to retaln the cloudy portion at the boundary In the funnel.
Rinse Inslde the stem of the separatory funnel with a stream of
water from a wash bottle.

Water Stripplng of Uranlum from Ethyl Acetate Layer Followed
by Sodium Hydroxlde=Hydrogen Peroxlde Colorimetric Finlsh. Add
15-ml. of water to the separatory funnel contalning the ethyl
acetate, stopper the flask, and shake the mlixture for about
1 minute. After washlng off the stopper with water, drain the
aqueous layer Ilnto a volumetrle flask of sultable slze and wash
the Beparatory funnel and ethyl acetate layer 4 or 5 times with
5=ml. portlons of water by means of a wash bottle. Combine the
aqueous fractions.

Add enough 20% sodium hydroxide solution (w./v.) to neu-
tralize the solution and dlssolve any preclpltated aluminum
hydroxide, then add 10 ml. in excess per 100 ml. of final
volume. Add 1 ml. of 30% hydrogen peroxide per 100 ml. of final
volume and make up the volume to the mark wlth distilled water.
Read the absorbahce after 20 minutes on the Beckman DU spectro=
photometer at 370 mp agalnst a reagent blank, using l-cm. Corex
cells and a ellt wldth of 0.2 mm. Compare the absorbances of
the samples agalnst the absorbances of astandard uranium solu-
tlons which ha#e been carriled through the procedure at the same
time. Choose the standards so that they cover the range 1nto
whlch fhe samples are expected to fall, using a ratio of one
standard to six samples. In practlce 1t 18 customary to work
between the limits of 10 and 30 mg. of uranlum oxide. This 1ia
arranged by estlmating the requlred sample welghts and diluting
and samplling accordingly. The final volume for colorimetric
reading 1s usually 250 ml.

Abstract

A method 1s dlscussed for the separation of uranium
and plutonium from vegetatlon, soll and water. The method
is based on the extractlion of uranium and plutonium from 4
to 6 N nitric acid into 50% tri-n-butyl phosphate in n-tetra=-
decane dlluent. Uranlum and plutonlum are recovered together
with sufficient reduction 1n total sollds to allow a-counting
and pulse heilght analysis. Data from several hundred "spiked"
gsamples to which uranium and plutonium were added 1ndlcate a
nearly equal recovery of uranlum and plutonium. Average re-
coveries are 76 * 14 per cent for vegetation, 76 + 16 per
cent for soll, and 82 + 15 per cent for water. The procgdure

1s designed for samples that may be collected and analyzed

Preparation of samples

Vegetatlon. Cut oven-dried vegetatlon into small pleces
and welgh 10.0 g into a 150 ml beaker. Heat the sample at
600°C, starting with a cold muffle furnace. When only white
ash remalns, remove fthe beéker from the muffle furnace and
allow to cool. Carefully add 2 ml of water, then add 10 ml
of 8 N HN03—O.5 E_Al(N03)3 solution. Cover the beaker with
a watch glase and boll the solutilon for 5 min. Allow to cool,
add 1 ml of 2 M__KNO2 golutlon and transfer the sample to a
100 ml centrifuge tube. Use 4 ﬂ_HN03 to complete the transfer.
Centrifuge and decant the supernate lnto a 125 ml cylindrilcal
geparatory funnel graduasted at 30 ml. Wash the residue with
4y N HN03, centrifuge, and decant the wash solutlon to the
separatory funnel. The acid normality of the combined solu-
tions at this point 1s 4-6 N and the total volume should not
exceed 29 ml. Proceed to the extractlon procedure.

Soll. Grind 5 g of oven-dried soll with a mortar and
peatle untll the entlre sample ocan pase through a 200-mesh
sleve. Welgh 1.0 g of the 200-mesh soll into a 50 ml platinum
cruclble and heat the sample at 600°C for 4 hr. Remove the
gample from the muffle furnace and allow to cool. Add 3 ml of
T0% HNO3 and 10 ml of 48% HF then stir the sample for 2-3
min wlth a platlnum rod. Beat the sample 1ln a 200°C sand
bath untlil all tracees of molsture are removed. Repeat thls
HN03—HF treatment belng careful that the sample 18 completely

Abstract

A slmple, rapld method for the determination of uranium in
impure aqueous solutlons was developed. Uranium(VI) 1s extracted
by 0.1M trl-n-octylphoaphine oxlde 1n cyeclohexane from a nitrie
acid solutlion. A yellow color ls formed In an aligquot of the or-
ganlc extract by additlon of dlbenzoylmethane and pyridine in ethyl
alcohol. Interference by catlons 1s mlnlimized or eliminated by
selectlive reduoction, by fluoride complexatlon, or by absorbance
measurement at 416 mp rather than 405 mu, the wave length of
maxlmum absorbance, Interference by excess fluorlde or phosphate
18 eliminated by addition of aluminum nitrate before extractlon.
The range of the method 1ls 20 to 3000 ¢ of uranium ln the origlnal
golution, and the standard deviatlon is +2%.

Apparatus and Reagents

 

Absorbance measurements were made with a Beckman DU gpectro-
photometer;, using 1.00-cm. Corex or sllica cells.

Phase equlllbration for moat extractions was carrilied out in
the bottom portion of the apparatus (see accompanying figure).
Phase separatlon and removal of allquots of the upper organic
phage occurred after inverting the apparatus so that the solutlon
was 1ln the portlon of thls apparatus shown on top 1n the figure.

Some extractions were carrled out in 60- or 125-m]. separatory funnels.
STANDARD URANIUM SOLUTIONS. A stock solutlon of 24.0 mg. of

uranium(VI) per ml. was prepared by heating 7.10 gram of uranium
(Iv-VI) oxide (U308), prepared from pure uranium(VI) oxide (UO3),
in 10 ml. of perchloric acld to dlssolve 1t, and then dlluting
the resultant solutlon to 250 ml. with water. Dilutions of this
solution were made as required. Another standard sclutlon in 5%
sulfurilc acld was also used 1In checklng the spectrophotometric

callbration curve.

PROCEDURE 9 (Continued)

DIBENZOYIMETHANE. A solutlon that contalned 1 gram of
dibenzoylmethaene (1,3-diphenyl-1,3-propanedione), obtained from
Eastman Kodak Co., in 100 ml. of 95% ethyl alcohol was prepared
for use as the chromogenlc agent.

PYRIDINE. For most of the work, a solution prepared by
mlxing 1 volume of redilstllled reagent grade pyridine and 1 volume
of 95% ethyl alcohol was used.

TRI-n=-0CTYLPHOSPHINE OXIDE. A 0.10M solution of thls material,
prepared 1in the authors! laboratory, 1n cyclohexane, Eastman 702
or 7025, was used. Thls phosphlne oxlde 1s now avallable commer-
clally from Eastman (EK T440).

Sodium bisulfite, 10 (w./v.} % in water, stored at about 10°C.

Hydroxylamine sulfate, 2M 1n water.

Potassium fluorlde, 1M in water, stored 1n a polyethylene
bottle,

Procedure

Preliminary Treatment .A. Samples which do not contain inter-
fering lons. Pipet a 0.5- to 8-ml. aliquot of a solution in nitric,
perchloric, or sulfuric acld, estlmated to contain 15 to 2500 ¥y
of uranium(VI), into the bottom portion of the extraction vessel.
By the addltion of strong 10M sodlum hydroxide, nitric acld, or
sodium nitrate, adjust the solutlon so that a total aqueous volume
of 10 ml. will be 12 to 3N in hydrogen lon and 2 to 4M in nitrate
ion. For almost neutral solutlens, 2 ml. of concentrated nitric
acid wlll give the correct concentrations for a 10-ml. aqueocus-
volume. AdJust the total volume to 10 ml. Up to 12 ml. of aqueous
solution can be shaken with 5 or 10 ml. of extractant in the ap-
paratus wlthout undue splashing. If the total aqueous volume i1s
greater than 12 ml. after adJusting the acldlty and nitrate con-
Ltent, perform the extractlon ln a separatory funnel instead of the

speclal extractlon veasel.

291
PROCEDURE 9 (Contlnued)

B. Semples containing ilron(III), chromlum(VI), or vana-
dium(V). Pipet a 0.5- to 6-ml. aliquot of a solution in dilute
perchloric or sulfurlc medlum, estlimated to contaln 15 to 2500 vy
of uranium(VI), Into the bottom portlon of the extractlon vessel.
Reduce the iron(III) to iron(II), the chromium(VI) to chromium(III),
and the vanadium(V) to vapadium(IV or III) without reducing the
uranium(VI) to uranium(IV). Sodium bisulfite 1s a satisfactory
reductant 1f the solutlons are bolled to remove excess sulfur
dloxlde. Hydroxylamlne sulfate is also a satlsfactory reductant,
but amalgamated zinc 1s unsuitable. Add sufficlent nltriec acld or
sodium nitrate and water so that the final agueous volume of 8 to
12 ml. wlll be 1 to 3N 1in hydrogen lon and 2 to 4M in nltrate ion.

C. Samples contalning tiltanlum, thorlum, hafnium, zirconlum,
or iron(III), but only traces of alumirmum. Plpet a 0.5- to 6-ml.
aliguot of a solutlion in dilute niltrle, perchloric, or sulfurlo
acld, estimated to contaln 15 to 2500 v of uranium, into the
bottom of an extractlion vessel. Add sufficient base or acid, nltrate,
end water to glve 2 volume of about 8 ml., such that the solution
18 1 to 3N in hydrogen ion and 2 to 4M in nitrate lons. Add up to
e maxlmum of 2.5 ml. of 1M potasslum fluorlde when the concentra-
tlons of interfering lons are unknown. If hligh concentrations of
these lons are known to be present, additlional fluoride can be
tolerated.

D. Samples contalning excessive fluoride or phosphate.

Pipet an allquot 1nto an extractlon vessel, and adjust the acld
and nitrate contents aB in Treatment C. Add sufficlent aluminum
nitrate to complex the fluoride and phosphate estimated to be
present. The total volume should be 12 ml. or less.

Extraction. For amounts of uranium estimated to be under
about 1400 vy, pilpet 5 ml. of 0.1M tri-n-cctylphosphine oxlde in

cyclohexane 1nto the extractlion veasel contalning the treated

PROCEDURE 10 .{Continued)

Procedure

In a 40-ml. tapered centrifuge tube add 1 ml. of uranium
carrier and 0.2 ml. of zirconium carrier (approximately 10 mg. per
ml. of zirconium) to a sultable aliquot of the sample solution.
Dilute to approximately 10 ml., mlx well, aﬁd precilpltate ammonium
dluranate by the additlon of conecentrated ammonlum hydroxlde.
Centrifuge for 2 minutes and dlscard the supernatant solutlon.
Wash the precipltate once with 15 ml: of ammonium hydroxide (1 to 1).

Dissolve the precipltate 1n 1 to 2 ml. of concentrated hydro-
chloric acld solutlon, dllute to about 10 ml., add 1 ml. of
hydroxylamine hydrochloride (5 M), and mix well. Precipitate
zlreconium hydroxlde by the addltion of concentrated ammonilum
hydroxide. Centrifuge for 2 minutes, add 0.2 ml. of zirconium
carrler, and etlr the supernatant solution, belng careful not to
disturb the precipltate. Centrifuge for 2 minutes. Add 0.2 ml.
of zirconlum carrler and repsat.

Transfer the supernatant solution to another 40-ml. centri-
fuge tuve, add several drops of phenolphthaleln, and adjust the
pH to approximately 8 by adding concentrated hydrochloric acid
solution dropwlse. Add an equal volume of concentrated hydro=-
chloric acid solutlon and extract for approximately 0.5 minute
wltha one-half volume portion of 5% (w./v.) trilsooctylamine-
xylene. Dilscard the aqueous phase. Wash the organlc phase by
mixing for 0.5 minute with an equal volume portion of 5 M hydro-
chloric acld solution. Repeat the wash step. Strip the uranium
from the orgenlc phase by mlxlng thoroughly with an equal volume
portion of 0.1 M hydrochlorie acld solution for 0.5 minute. Dlscard
the organlc phase.

Add 0.2 ml. of zirconlum carriler, mix well, and repeat the
" above procedure, beginning with the precipltation of ammonium

diuranate.

sultable cork and count the uranium-237 gamma radloactivity in a
well-type sclntillstlion counter. Count the same day of the last
chemical separation.

Apply a blank correction 1f very low uranium-237 levels are
being determined. Determlne this correction by takling the pame
aliquot of uranium carrier through the exact procedure described
above. The blank correction 1s due primarily to the gamma radlo-

actlivlity assoclated wilth the uranium-235 1n the uranlum carrier.

PROCEDURE 11 (Continued)

Separatlon. Solutlions of uranyl sulfate contalning 0.1 and
1.0 mg. of uranium were mixgd with different amounts of bismuth
trichloride solutlion. A solutlon of the dlsodium salt of EDTA was
added to give a bismuth to EDTA ratio of 1 to 30. The pH of the
mixture was ralsed to 7.5 by careful additlon of 1§Isod1um hydroxide.
Then approximately 10 ml. of acetylacetone was added and the mix-
ture shaken for 10 minutes. The acetylacetone phase was separated,
filtered, and made up to a volume of 10 ml., of which 2 ml. was
wlthdrawn by a plpet iInto a 10-ml, boroslllicate glass volumetric
flask. The flask was very gently warmed untll the liquid was re-
duced in volume to about 0.5 ml. Then the supporting electrolyte
was added and the resulting solutlon deaerated for 5 minutes in
a 10-ml, Lingane-Lalitlinen H-type polarographlc electrolysis cell.
The polarogram was then recorded and the concentration of uranium

found from sultable callbration curves.

used for all operations. The uranlum recoverﬁ at the milligram
level in an initisl 30-ml. sample wﬁa deﬁermined colorimetrically
as 94%. ¥ith 0.03 to0 0.13 7 of radioactive uranium-233 tracer

and 20 ¥ of natural uranium as carrier, the récovery is B86%;

the latter includes the addltional step of electrodeposltion of
the uranium onto a platinum planchet prilor to measurement by alpha
counting, which 18 only 94% complete. The decontamination possible
with this procedure was checked with 0.07 v quantities of uranlum-
233 in the presence of high mixed fisslon product activities; 85%
recovery. was obtained, contelning only 0.9% of the fission product
alpha activity (assumed to be uranium).

Apparatus
The reaction cell and simple eleotrical circult used 1s

shown 1n the aocompanying figure.

The electrolysls vessel, C, 18 protected from mercury lons
diffusiné from the working reference calomel electrode, A, by a
medium glase frit between B and C, and a fine frit backed with
en agar plug between B and A, Between runs, cell C 13 kept filled
wlth saturated potassium ohloride solution.

The apparafus for the electrodeposlitlon of uranium onto
platinum disks or planchets and for alpha-countlng measurement
of the resulting uranium plates have been deseribed.£ Beta
activity was measured by a chlorine-quenched argon=filled Gelger-
RMuller counter (1.4 mg. per sq. cm. of window) with a Model 165
scaler; a scintillation well counter with a thallium-activated
godium iodide erystal and a Model 162 scaler was used for gamma-
activity measurement of solutions (ca. 5 ml.) contained in a 13
x 150 mm. test.tube. The scalers and counters are made by the
Nuclear Inptrument and Chemlcal Corp. For examlnation of the

gamma-rey spectrum, a gamma-ray sclntillation spectrometer (bullt

through the courteasy of W. Wayne Melnke.

Reggents
All chemlcals used were of C.P. or reagent grade unless

otherwise speclfied. The ethereal cupferron solution used (200
to 300 mg. of cupferron per 50 ml.) was actually a hydrogen oup-
ferrate solution; the ether and cupferron were mixed ln s mixing

chloride solution from the funnel through 1. € is dralined and
rinsed; 1 18 left open for a time to flush the frit. With 3 cloeed,
4 to 5 ml. of triple-distlilled mercury 1s placed in C. About 30 ml.
of uranyl sulfate solution (0.5 to 5 mg. of uranium and 0.5 to 1.5%
in sulfuric acld) is added and a potential of -0.35 volt vs.
S.C.E. 18 applled to the mercury. About 15 to 20 ml. of the
ether cupferron solution lg added. Stirring 1s adjusted at Just
over the minimal rate for efficlent current flow (usually about
0.2 ma. flows without stirring and 1.2 to 2.6 ma. with stirring).

Stopcock 1 is opened for about 30 seconds at approximately
S-minute .intervals throughout the run to minimlze any loss of
uranium into the bridge. A% 15- or 20-minute intervals, stirring
18 interrupted, the ether extract 1s bled through stopcock 4 into
cell D, and 15 to 20 ml. of fresh ether-cupferron solution 1s added.

Extraction and Measurement at Microgram Uranium Level. A
gslution of uranium-233 (10'7 to 10'8 gram) together with about
20 v of natural uranium (as sulfate) was submitted to reductive

nitric acld. The comblned nltrilc acld extract was evaporated to
about 5 ml., treated with 25 to 30 ml. of concentrated nitric and
2 ml. of perchloric acid, and then evaporated to dryness. The
residue was digested with 10 ml. of 0.1M nitric acid for a few
minutes; the solutlon obtalned, after addition of about 10 vy more
of natural uranium (as sulfate), was used for electrodeposition
of the uranium onto a platinum planchet from an oxalate medium.2
A windowlees flow counter wlth Q-gas was used for counting the
alpha emisslon from the electrodeposited uranium.2
The whole operation took about 4 to 5 hours. Each méasure-
ment of alphas from the samples was callbrated by counting a

uranium oxlide standard (Natlonal Bureau of Standards No. 836-5).

Note 1. In some rune the current dropped to a low level soon
after the requisite number of eoulombs had passed for about a 3-
electron reduction of the uranium present. In other cases, the
current dld not deorease, but dlscontinuance of the run beyond
any pcint where twlce the theoretical ourrent had passed gave
patisefactory uranium recovery. In the latter cases, a gray ether-
insoluble, but alcohol=-soluble precipltate (apparently a merocury
cupferrate), was usually evident in the agueous phase. The cur=
rent efflclericy for the deslred process appeared to be good 1n
most runs.

The comblned ether extracts may be re=sxtracted 1ln cell D by
lnserting a clean stirrer, or they may be tranaferred witﬂ.rinsing
into a ¢lean separatory funnel. Three extractions with 20 to 30
ml. each of 0.5M, 4M; and 0.5M nitric acld were adequate to re-

extract uranium into aqueous sclution.

Abstrect

The development of solvent-extraotlon methods for deter-
mining trace amounts of uranium-233 in 1rradiated thorium is
described. Thorium and 1ts alpha-emitting daughters are com-
pPlexed with EDTA, and, when uranium-233 ls extracted as 1ts di-
ethyldithleocarbamate complex, only blsmuth-212 accompanies 1it.
This 1s Immaterlal for colorimetrie or fluorimetric finlshes, but,
for determlnation of the uranium-233 by alpha counting, the
bismuth~212 must first be allowed to decay. If, however, the
uranium-233 1p extracted gs 1ts 8-hydroxyquinoline ocomplex, no
alpha emitter accompanles 1t and concentratlions of uranlum-233

Abstract

The separation of uranlum from the lons interferlng wlth 1ts
analysls 1s accomplished by the adsorptlion of the uranium(VI) sul-
fate complex on a quaternary ammonium anion exchange resin._ Intef-
ference of such lons &8 1ron(III) and vanadium(V) is avolded by
thelr preferentlal reduction wlth sulfurous acid so that they, as
well a8 other cations, are not retained by the resin., Uranium is
eluted for analysls by dllute perchlorilic acid. The methed is

applicabie to both solutlons and ores.

Ore Solutlon

Two methods for the opening of_uranium-bearing ores were
investigated in conJunction with the lon exchange separatlion. The
flret 1s the standard digestlon wlth hydrofluoric and nltrlc aclds,
with subsequent evaporatlon to dryneass followed by a sodium car-
bonate fusion.2 The carbonate melt 1s dissolved in 5% sulfuric
acld to form a solution for the separation. A second method for
routine enalysls, designed to eliminate the need for hood facili-
tles and platinum vessels; lnvelves an oxldatlive leach with an
acidic manganese(IV) oxlde syatem. This procedure 18 given in
detail below. Other workersE, using the auvthors' separation
procedure, have recommended solutlon of the ore by treatment with

12M hydrochloric aclid plus 162 nitric acld followed by fuming'

307
PROCEDURE 15 (Continued)

wilth sulfurlce aecld to produce a sultable uranium solution for the
column influent.

Procedure. Welgh out samples of ore estimated to contaln
an amount of uranium oxlde less than 100 mg. but sufficient to be
detected by the chosen method of analysis. Add 20 ml. of 20% by
volume sulfuric acid and 2 grams of manganese(IV) oxide. Heat
the mixture to bolling. Allow to cool to room temperature. Dilute
with approximately 50 ml. of water. AdJust to a pH between 1.0
and 1.5 by the dropwlss addition of 20% sodium hydroxide. Filter
through fine-pore filter paper using two 10;m1. portions of water

to wash the residue on the paper.

Ton Exchange Separation

Apparatus. Tubes 0.5 inch in dlameter with high-porosity
sintered glass fllter disks fused to the lower end are used to
contaln the resin, The rafte of flow of solutlons through the
tube 18 regulated by a Bcrew elamp on rubber tubing below the
filter. Small separatory funnels are attached to the top of the
column to feed the sample and reagents.

Procedure. Convert a portion of quaternary ammonium anion
exchange resin (Amberlite XE-117, Type 2) of mesh size %0 to 60
{U.S. soreene) to the sulfate form by treating a column of it with
IQ% sulfurio acld, using 3 volumes per volume of resln. Rinse the
acld=treated resin with delonigzed water until the effluent 1s
neutral to methyl red. Draln the resin so prepared free of excess
water and store 1n a bottle. A 5-ml. portion of thils resin 1s used
for a single analysls. The resln 1s loaded into the filter tube and
the bed so formed 18 backwashed with enough water to free 1t of
alr. After the resln has settled the excess water is drained off
to within 1 cm. of the top of the bed prior to the passage of the
sample through the bed.

Add 5 drops of 0.1% methylene blue to the partially neu-

308
PROCEDURE 15 (Continued)

tralized (pH 1.0 to 1l.5) solution from the dissolved sodium car-
bonate melt or from the flltered manganese(IV) oxide leach. Add
6% sulfurous acid dropwise until the methylene blue is decolorized
and then add a 5-ml. excesB. Pass the reduced sample through the
resin bed at a rate not exceeding 2 ml. per minute. Wash the sam-
ple contalner with two 10-ml. portions of water, passing the
washing through the resih bed at the same flow rate. Elute the
uranium with 50 ml. of 1M perchloric acid. Determlne the uranium
content of the perchlorioc acld fractlon colorlimetrically by the
standard sodium hydroxide-hydrogen peroxide methodZ o# volumetri-
callyg. For colorlimetric analysis standard uranium solutlons
containing perchloric acld should be used 1n establishing the

are not readlly retalned by cellulose alone when ether containing
5 per cent v/v of concentrated nitric acid, sp.gr. 1.42, 18 used
as the extraction solvent.

METHOD FOR SAMPLES CONTAINING MOLYBDENUM OR ARSENIC OR BO'TH
Solvent--Add 5 ml of concentrated nitrlec acld, sp.gr« 1.42, to
each 95 ml of ether.

PREFARATION OF ALUMINA-CELLULOSE COLUMN--

The adsorptlon tube for the praparation.of the colum 1z a
glass tube about 25 cm long and 1.8 em in dlameter. The upper
end 18 flared to a dlameter of gbout 8 em to form a funnel that
permlts easy transfer of the sample. The lower end terminates
in a short length of narrow tubling and 1ls closed by a short
length of polyvinyl chloride tublng carrylng a screw cllip. The
inslde surface of the glass tube 1s coated wlth a slllicone in
the manner described by Burstall and Wells.2

Welgh 5 or 6 g of cellulose pulp* into a stoppered flask and
cover 1t with ether-nltric acld solvent. Pour the suspenslon ln-
to the glass tube, agltate gently and then gently press'down-the
cellulose to form a homogeneocus column. Wash the column wlth
about 100 ml of ether-nltric acld solvent and finally allow the
level of the solvent to fall to the top of the cellulose. Next
pour about 15 g of activated alumintum oxide* on top of the
cellulose, pour on 30 ml of ether-nlitric acld solvent and vig-
orously agilitate the alumina with a glass plunger. Allow the
packing to settle.. Allow the level of the ether to fall to the

surface of the alumina and the column 1s ready for use.

PREPARATION OF SAMPLE SOLUTION FROM MINERAL OR ORE=-

Welgh 1nto a platinum dish sufficlent of the sample to gilve
100 to 150 mg of U303, which 1s a convenient amount for a volu-
metric determinatlon. Decompose the sample by treatment with
nitric and hydrofluoric aclds in the manner describaed by Burstall
and Wells.® Finally remove hydrofluoric acid by repeated evapora-
tilons with nitrlc acld and take the sample to dryness. If the
addition of dilute nitrlc acid indicates the presence of undecom-
poeed materlal, fllter the insoluble residue on to a filter-paper
and ignite and fuse 1t 1In a nickel orucible with a few pellets
of potasslium hydroxide. Then add the melt to the filtrate and
take the whole to dryness.

Add 4 ml of diluted nitric aecid, 25 per cent v/v, to the
dry residue, gently warm to dlssolve the mixture and then ecol
the solution, which 1s then ready for chromatography.

EXTRACTION OF URANIUM—

Transfer the sample on a wad of dry cellulose pulp to the
top of the prepared alumina-aellulose columm? and extract the
uranium with 200 to 250 ml of ether-ni@ric acld solvent if ar-
senlc or molybdenum and arsenle is present in the origlnal samplae.
If molybdenum alone 18 present, the amount of solvent can he
reduced to 150 ml. Screen the column from direot sunlight. After
removal of ether from the eluate, determine the uranium volume-
trically. 2l

natural urgnium (say, up to three times more or 2 per cent) may
be Ilrradiated as polld; thils 1s usually U308° For these cut a
B=cm length of 2-mm polythene tubing and seal one end bylwarming

magnesium oxlde to form a compact layer 4 to 5 mm in helght at
the sealed end of thé tube. Welgh the tube and contents, add
308 and re-welgh. Add a further simllar layer
of magneslum oxide on top of the U3°8 and then seal the open end.
Leave a free space about 1 cm long between the top of the mag-
nesium oxlde layer and the seal, for ease of opening. Treat
standard aend samples similarly. Place the tubes elther 1n.a
"special polythene bottle for irradilation in the pneumatic "rabbit"
of the pille or in a 3-inch aluminum can for irradiation 1n'£he
Yaself-perve"” holes in the pille. Irradiation 1s carried out for
any requlred time; usually 1t is about. .5 minutes. After irra-
dlating, place the contalners in lead shleldlng for about 15
hours. After thie perlod, tap down the ocontents of the polythene

tube away from one end and carefully ocut off the top. Empty the
contents into & 50-ml centrifuge tube. (The plug of magnesium
oxlde serves to "rinee” the sample tube as it ls emptied.) Add
2 ml of concentrated nitric acid (sp.gr. 1.42), gently warm to
"dissolve, and finally boll off the nltroue fumes. Add 5.00-m1
of a barium solution to act as carrier (a solution of 18 g of
barium chloride, BaCl,*2H,;0, in 500 ml of water).

quantitlies of solld sample must he lrradiated 1n small sillica
ampoules. The ampoules, whlch have a capaclty of about 1 ml,
are prepared from sillica tubing. After one end of each has been
sealed, the ampdules are welghed, the sample solution added from
a flne-pointed glass dropplng-tube and the ampoules re-welghed.
Pack the ampoules, after sealing the open ends, 1in cotton wool 1n
a 3-inch aluminium can and irradiate them in the "self-serve"
posltlon of the plle. The time of lrradlation necessary can be
calculated from the usual activation formulé; as an example, 1
pg of uranium-235 irradiated for 24 hours 1n a flux of 1012 neu-
trones per sq. cm per second glves about 5000 counts per minute
of barium-140 at 5 per cent counting efficlency, 24 hours after
the 1rradiation.

After removing them from the pile,'place the samples and
gptandards in lead shlelding for about 15 hours; the maln actlvity
1s due to silicon-31l. Transfer the ampoules to 100-ml tall-form
beakers contalning a few milliliters of water and 5.00 ml of

radloactivation analysis. The principles of the actlvation
analysip method used in this determination and the processing of
1rrddlated samples are dlscussed. Thils method of analysis 18 a

Nuclear Irradiation of Sample. Welghed portions of the
samples and the comparative standard are put into small quartz
tubas. The tubems are closed with cork stoppers that are wrapped
in gluminum. They are then irradlated in the reactor. After
irradiation, the samples are allowed to decay about 4 hours and
are then chemically processed as described below. The synthetle
samples used 1in thls laboratory had been processed by a fllter
paper partitlion chromatography technligue. After the separation,
the paper was convenlently 1irradlated in short pleces of quartz
tubing whoee openings were plugged by meana of cork stoppers.

Chemlcal Separatlion of Neptunlum=-239. In most neutron
activatlon analyses, é chemlcal separatlon 1s made to lsclate
the radiocactivity of the element from all other radloactlve

of both the 1rradilated specimen and the comparison samples. The
golutions are then processed chemlcally to lsolate the carrler
and deslred radloelement from other elements and contamlnant
radloactivitles. 3mall amounts of other elements are added as
holdback or socavenging carrlers to asslst In the decontamlination
process.

Although neptunium-239 has a convenlent half l1life, 1t does
not have a stable 1sotope that can be used a8 an'lsotoplc carriler.
However, Seaborgi has shown that trace quantities of neptunium-
239 can be quantitatively carried on a nonlsotople carrler, such
as cerilum. The method of analyals reported below uees lanthanum
as a nonlsotoplc carrler for the neptunium-239 radiocactivity.

(See Note 1.)

Chemlcal Separation Procedure. PREPARATION. The lrradiated
ore and soll specimens are dissolved by digestion in a mixture of
concentrated nitric, hydrofluoric, perchloric, and sulfuric
acids. (Additional hydrofluoric acid can be added 1f a residue
of sllica remains 1n the bottom of the crucible.) After dissolu-
tion, the sample 1s concentrated to heavy sulfuric acid fumes,
cooled, and transferred to a 15-ml. centrifuge tube. If a residue
(sulfate salts) remains after the transfer, the solutlon is cen-
trifuged for 5 minutes, the supernatant transferred to another
tube, and the resldue washed with 1 ml. of 1M nitrlc acid. The
wash 1ls added to the supernatant and the residue discarded.
(Centrifugation is always for the stipulated time and at full
speed.) The sample 1s then further processed by the procedure
reported herein.

The irradiated synthetlc samples (paper chromstograms) are
processed by carefully igniting the paper contained in a porcelain
cruclble in a muffle furnace. The resildue 1s dilssolved in about

0.5 ml. of concentrated nitrlc acld. After dissolution, the

318
PROCEDURE 18 (Continued)

sample 1s transferred to a 15-ml. centrifuge tube and the process-
Ing continued wlth the procedure reported herein.

PROCEDURE. Three (3.0} milligrams of lanthanum and 0.250
ml. of 5M hydroxylamine hydrochlorlde solutlon are added to the
supernatant solutlon and the mixture digested for 5 mihutes wlth
occaslonal stlrring. The solution is cautiously neutralized with
concentrated ammonium hydroxlde to precipitate lanthanum hydroxide,
after which the mixture 18 centrifuged and the supernatant liquid
discarded.

The precipltate of lanthanum hydroxide is dissolved in 2 ml.
of 2M hydrochloric acld, and 1.0 mg. of strontlium (added as a
solution of strontium niltrate to serve as a holdback or scavenglng
carrier) and 0.250 ml. of 5M hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution
are added to the solution. The solutlon ls agaln digested for
5 minutes wlith Ilntermittent stirring, and 0.200 ml. of concentrated
hydrofluorlc acld 1s added dropwlse to the solutlon to precipiltate
lanthanum fluoride. After centrlfugation, the supernatant liquild
1s discarded and the preclpitete washed wlth 0.5 ml. of 1M hydro-
fluorie acld-1M nitric acld solution.

After washlng, the lanthanum fluorlde precipltete ls dissolved
ln 0.5 ml. of saturated borlc acld solution and 1.0 ml. of 6M
nitriec acld. One (1.0) mllliliter each of 10% potassium perman-
ganate solutlon and water are added to thlse solutlon, and the
resulting mixture ls agltated well and digested for 5 minutea.
Lanthanum fluoride 1s agaln precipltated wilth 0.250 ml. of con-
centrated hydrofluoric acld; the solution 1ls centrifuged and the
supernatant llquld transferred to another centrifuge tube. The
preclpitate is washed with 0.5 ml. of 1M hydrofluoric acid-1M nitriec
aclid solutlion and the wash comblined with the supernatant liquid.
The preclpltate 1ls dlscarded.

Three milligrams of lanthanum are added to the supernatant

liquid, and the solutlon 18 digested for 5 minutes and ¢entrifuged.
An additional 3.0 mg. of lanthanum are added to the supernatant
11quid and the solutlon agitated and digested for 5 minutes wilthout
disturbing the first precipltate on the bottom of the tube; then
the solution is centrifuged and the supernatant liquild transferred
to another centrifuge tube. The preclpltate 138 washed with 0.5

ml. of 1M hydrofluoric acild-1M nitric acild solution; centrifuged,
and the wash comblined wlth the supernatant liquid. The precipl-
tate 1s discarded.

One milligram of zirconium (added as a solution of zirconium
nitrate to serve as a holdback or scavenglng carrier) and 0.250 ml.
of 5M hydroxylamine hydrochloride are added to the solution and
the mixture agitated and digested 5 minutes. Three (3.0) milli-
grams of lanthanum and 2 ml. of 2M hydrofluoric acld are added
to the solutilon, and the solutlion 1s digested for 20 minutes and
then centrifuged. The supernatant liquid i1s dlecarded. The pre=-
clpltate 1s washed with 0.5 ml. of 1M hydrofluorlc acid-1M nitric
acld solution, and the resulting mlxture 1s centrifuged. The
wash 8olution 1s dlscarded after the centrifugation.

The precipitate 1s slurried in a small amount of 1M nitric
acid (about 0.5 ml.) and transferred to a small borosilicate glass
culture tube by means of a transfer pipet. The centrifuge cone
18 ringed wlth three 0.5-ml. portlions of 1M nitrie acld and the
rinses transferred to the ceculture tube. The tube 1s stoppered
wlth a cork stopper and the ¥ radiocesctivity measured by a well-
type gamma scintlllatlon counter.

The standard sample of uranium oxide (U308) is dissolved
in nitric acld and an aliquot of the solution processed under
the same condltions as the specimen samples. The uranium content
of the sample 1n question 1s dqyermined by equating the ratio of
the corrected neptunium-239 radioactlivity count in the unknown
