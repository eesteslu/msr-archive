"THE LANGUAGE OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE

"The publications’ of scientists. concerning their
1nd1v1dual work -have been so copious -- and. so.
unreadable for _anyone but their fellow spec1allsts
‘This has been a great handicap to science itself,
- »for basic advances' in scientific' knowledge often
_,sprlng from the cross-fertilization of knowledge
'7from different spec1allsts. What is even more
_ominous is that science .has increasingly lost touch
- with non-scientists. Under such circumstances scien-
~ tists come to be regarded as magicians -- feared
rather than admired. And the: impression that science
1s 1ncomprehen81ble magic, to be understood only by
a chosen few who are suspiciously different from
" ordinary mankind, 1s -bound to turn many youngsters
away from science. .

or new meanings must be given- to old words, in order to identify a
specialized concept.. The great uariety of these specialized terms o L&
“used in variouS‘professions'mayvbe_glimpsed by bfowsing~threugh an
interesting compilation,uedited by.the~we11~known*1inguist,.MarioAPeil.
Turning the pages of this“book; ne encounter the”jargon,of anthropology,
architecture, e linguisties,tliterature, and of the theatre. We may |
thus learn that in the speech of‘aetors, ”darling"_meané "a casual
acquaintance whose name I do not remember'". On the other hand, the j T
meaning of colorful electronics engineering teims, such as ''negative
.feedback” and '"white noise'", is also hidden from'the uninitiated. The
editor points out that of the about one million WOrdS'in‘the English
language, the average cultivated person probably.uses only about 30,000
words and is abile to reeognize and understand only an additional 60,000.
I would like to examine briefly another highly specialiied lan-
~guage, -- that of the nuclear engineer and scientist. This relatively _ o
new field needed many new words te convey a specialized meaning or to |
designate new machines and facilities. Some of the terms were taken
from thevbasic*sciences‘involved in nuclear‘research; many entries
in nuclear glossaries, and terminology books are simple englneerlng
and sc1ent1f1c terms as used in nuclear appllcatlons o
* The purely scientific terms represent an 1mportant source of the
nuclear language. . The concepts must be carefully deflned -to ensure
that the reader will understand. exactly what the author means. They
usually are issued by national ‘and 1nternat10na1 committees and are

2, As a member of such a

made available in form of off1c1a1 glossarles
”work group', I had an opportunlty to observe how much critical thought
is needed to def1ne a seemingly 1nnocuous term. Commlttee members must
represent the various fields 1nvolved in nuclear science to ensure

that the health phy51c1st the metallurglst or the de51gn englneer

indeed mean the same thing when they use the same word.

In addition to such assistance to professionals by meaﬁs of these
official glossaries, the requirements of general'readers and students
have not been forgottenS.: Technical societies and government agencies
provide assistance to science writers by providing compilations and
simplified definitions of terms, including many of interest to the
nuclear field. These~collections are of educational character; the
terms are explained, rather than defined.

As the nuclear field continued'tq grow and assumed -an increasing
importance in the economy and political life throughout the world, more
ambitious cyclopedias and lexicons were published in various 1anguages;

When we examlne the origins of "nuclear language'', we must keep in

‘mind that the field grew up in secrecy, it was born under conditions of

wartime urgency, followed by a period of mutual suspicion which divided
the scientific countries of the world into opposite camps. When the

first truly world-wide meeting was held in Geneva in August 1955, many

nations discovered that their language,did not have the terms suitable

to express the new concepts.' Because of its rich nuclear literature,

English became the.predominant language and ever since has exerted a great

.influehce on the terminology throughout the world. One of the first

acts of the organizers of the 1955 Geneva Conference on the Peaceful

Uses of Atomic Energy was to commission the compilation of a dictionary

** The U.S. Glossary points out that enrichment may mean enrichment

factor or enrichment factor minus one (degree of enrichment). These
terms: - should: be-avoided.. Under enrichment factor reference is
made to separation f&ctor, a different but related concept.
covering the official languages of the United-Natiohs' ~ A new improved
,ed1t1on was published in time for the Second Geneva’ Conference5. Within

a short t1me ~a number of b111ngua1 and multlllngual nuclear dictionaries , 7

appeared on the market©. _

The plethora of these def1n1t1ons, explanatlons and equivalents in
other languages was helpful in clarifying the méaning of terms. However,
it should be kept in mind that;language is a living organismj words,
expressione, and specialized meahings are born, are used and ultimately
die. We may define correct usage and coin suitable expreSsions,,but

they remainvwithout effect if the technical men do not use them and

»

editors do not insist oh their oorrect meaning. One well-known scien-
tific lexicographer étated_lt very aptly in an international meeting on
nuclear terminology, when he cautioned'the-partioipants against excessiVe
zeal: "We are only recordlng angels and not God Almighty". 7 It is
indeed useless to devise 1og1ca1 def1n1t10ns, if authors and ed1tors
refuse to use them. ' | |
In this short review I proposevto leare‘the serious examination

of technlcal ‘terms to the learned commlttees, and will examine primarily
the more ephemeral and colorful express1ons of the nuclear: language £
which enrich the field and give it a special. flavor

- There are many expressions, such as the first sentence of this
paper, which are used primarily_orally and are seldom written down.
I heard alnuclear incident descrihed as a felt-hat incident. ‘This
‘concept poetulates that a worker.hear a swimmlng-poolrreaotor will some-
~ times wear a felt hat which will drop into the pool and will he sucked to
the fuel elements where it will prevent'the'flow of cooling water,
resulting in a meltdoWn.of.the_element . Such accidents have indeed oc-
curred, although withléhoetcovers,jloose pieces of metal etc. instead
of felt hats. They are usually.referred to‘as‘"felt-hat accidents'
although not in formal reports B o o

need and perhaps, also to keep the subject matter from the unanltlated

This often resulted in a compromlse as if techn1cal discussions were

a guessing game, in which the subject is drsgu1sed but some helpful
hints are»given. The language of specialists may be analyzed from

different_points_of.view. We'oould examine the origin of the words

“that used by a psychologist ‘who analyzed "space speak”, the engineering

of space terms,such as countdown pad abort umbilical, made those

words more W1dely used ‘in general speech However hlS main approach

- was 11ngulst1c ana1y51s, he found . that space engineers make abundant

'use of nominal compounds.

I do not 1ntend to make such a complete grammatical ana1y31s of techni-
cal texts and in the follow1ng pages. will concentrate 'my attention on
individual terms and c code names used by nuclear spec1alists, try1ng to
decipher how“and why they were chosen

It is important to keep 1n mind that words not - only have 1ntellectual

meanlngs, but may also carry an emotlonal impact. Some of them hit us

'and arouse strong feellngs°_ We may react with fear, dlsgust enthu51asm,

‘pride etc. to words such as ptnk yeZZow scab our country This power

of words is well known and is sklllfully used by such d1fferent people

as orators, politicians, demagogues and preachers

an ambivalent effect: 1t may 1nduce fear or arouse admlratlon If one

As our goal is the examination of 1nd1v1dual terms in the nuclear

field, we must be struck by the fact that thlS area of endeavor is-
based on the linguistica11y7incompa?ible term atomic fission. Atomic
means;indivisible;'fission indicates division. Thus, progress of science
overtook the old definition, whosé,ofiginal meaning has been fqrgotten

by now. o i o R - A

When new WOrds are coined,'there is always a tendency to avoid dis-

agreeable images and to arouse pléaéant-thqughts° In a well-known weekly
magazine it was brought up that physicians are stérting.to call pépfpiils
activity boosters and garage mechanics call themselves automotive in-

ternists. In the same article, a Jules Feiffer cartoon character is

i»

cited as follows: '"First I was poor. Then I became needy. Then I was
.underprivilegéd.. Now I am disadvanﬁaged, 'I.still don't have a penny
to my name - but I have a great'vocabulary;ﬂ |

The requirements.of seérecy, ego boosfing as expressed by bélonging
to a select group, and euphemisfic‘teﬁdencies are thus the chief factors
affecting theilanguagevof the ﬁew'$¢ience. ‘Let us see how they have shaped
the language of huclear4science. ' | o

At the beginning .of the Manha;tan'Project, steps were taken to avoid : -
4 mentionihg the element uranium. . In all the reports it was referred to | | |
as Tuballoy énd designated by ﬁhé'symbol T. The enriched material was : &
called Oralloy, and 235y was»désignated as element 25 (from its atomic. |
number 9§_ahd atomic weight 235), :On the same basis, plutonium was.
designated as 49, since it was. element 94 with an atomic weight of 239.
Urahium and plutonium were referred to in many of the early reports as
‘soﬁrce material and product,'reépectively.:~ |

The problem of naming the néw element was an important precaution
during the early days. I fouhd=an interesting document representing
the minutes of a meeting held;on:Apfil 22-23, 1942 in Chiqagolof A
portion of the SeSsion Was‘devotedhto a réviéw of the various code names.

Thiele,‘Seaerg, Kennedy, Urey;:Wigner,'Hilberry, Boyd, Johns, Wilhelm,
Perlman, Wahl and Wheeler. Amqngudther subjects, a suitable terminology. - y

for the heaviest elements WaS-discu$sed. One of the possibilities

‘ \ﬁ

considered was to name Elementf93fnéptuniumtand Element 94 plutonium.
It was agreed, however, that these designations might eventually be the

actual names for these elementékand;therefore«should'ndt be used as
 

code names. Up to that time the.terms“éopper and silver were used to

designate the new elements.'.Thisfmethod'was not. specific conce;ning the

"~ isotopes and caused'eonsiderable confusion with the actual elements

named,'if_they.Were involved in the same analytical process. It was
often necessary to use the term honest to God silver -to distinguish'
"silver"’from other elements. Therefore it was suggested to use a

terminology based on the last digit,in the atomic number and atomic

weight characterizing ‘the given substance:

Element 94, Atomic weight 239 - 49
Element 93, Atomic weight 239 - 39.
Element 92, Atomic weight 238 - 28 °
Element 92, Atomic weight 235 - 25
Element 92, Atomic weight 234 - 24

" Element 94 (generic) .40 or 4

Element 92 (generic) 20 or 2

. According to a recent artiele by a prominent?pagticipant, it was
McMillan who named Element 93 neptuniwm because Neptune is the next
planet after Uranus, andAproposed that Element 94 should be named
after Plutoll, A discussion developed whether its symbol should be
Pl or Pu. The-author: wrote: 'we liked the symbol 'Pu" better for the
reaeon that you might suspect'". The expected great.reaction to the

symbol, after it was declassified, never materlallzed
The above coding system was probably respon51ble for the naming '

were no more .planets to supply names for further elements, and the next

w1tt11y by the man who had so much to do with them ~AEC Chairman Glenn

" Element 97 was called berkelium after the city of Berkeley, Cali-
fornla,and Element 98 was named californium after the university and

the state where the work was done. However, this latter name: does not

that these elements are chemical analogs of europium, gadolinium and

terbium, named after a continent, a scientist and'a‘city,.respectively. . ir
In anhouncing their discovery in the Physical Review, the authors |
commented ''the best we can do is‘to point 6ut, in recognition of the

fact that dysprosiwm is named on the basis of a Greek work meaning

difficult to get at, that the searchers for another element a century | o

ago found it 'difficult to get'to_California"!° The naming'of these

i

elements was commented on in an'unéxpected place, the Talk of the Town
section of the New-Yorkef magazine. Thé writer remarked that ''the busy
scientists in1California will come up with another element or two one
of these days and the’ University has loét forever a chance of immorta-
lizing itself in the atomic tables with some such sequence as uni-
véréitium (97), ofium (98) ,californium (99), berkelium (100). In
rebuttal, the discoverers“stated thatlﬁby using’thése names first, we
have forestalled the appaliing possibility that some New Yorker-might : .

follow with the .discovery of 99 and 100 and 'apply the name »ewZum and

\o Ty

yorkium. The New Yorker: staff iejoined-that they are already working
in theéir office laboratories on these two elements but ''so far we just
have the names'". |
Many ORNL staff members had an opportunity to ‘hear Chalrman Seaborg
‘hlmself tell this story when he presented in Oak Rldgq in November 1966,
a reminiscence entitled 'Voices from the Past", contaln;ng“orlglnal
tape recordings of great historical interest.
Wartime codeslhad_toApe primarily innocuous words, unrelated to
the concept, although we have seen:that this was. not always true. ' Thus,
by an intefesting.coincidence, all buildings in which the actual electro-

‘designated by numbers starting with 92 ... It is difficult to give a

For people interested in the 1ore of names,‘browsing through the

abbrev1at10ns, n1cknames and acronyms can be quite rewardlng13 -

One may learn that Mighty Mouse represented a proposal for a.

Attempts were made to'syetematize code designations. For example,
the underground nuclear tests~at Los: Alamos were designated first by
burrowing mammals such as Bandicoot, Bobac, Aardvark,detc., a seemingly
appropriate category. When'theytran out of such names they were-
forced to use sone "burrowing" mamnals'Which-may have dug_only an -

- Names were never a531gned 1n such a manner,although codes to
designate actual sites of the large pro;ects were carefully selected.'

Let us turn our attention to another new field which has also
staffed,with the atomic.age. The healtH physicists\invéhted many
colorful terms to designate their specialized instfuments. The first
light-weight meter was named cutie pie after his wife by a romantic
engineer. Even though some labbratories do not stand for such nonsense
and insist calling the instrument "CP meter", cutie pte is a more
pleasing term than CP-meter to designaté?ﬁl,. a small, light weight,
portable, gamma-measuring, beta-indicating , survey instrument with an

ionization chamber coupled to a balancéd bridge circuit ."25;.'A'

~ portable detection instrument operated as if it wére:sniffing the alpha

emitters; it was quite natura{;ﬁo paste on its side a decal of the

famous Disnéy dog,‘bluto “sniffing the ground. Unfortunately, a securlty—_
minded supervisor became disturbed by. this name which was very close to
that of the still-classified plutonlum and }ssued an order forbidding

ifs use. It was suggested to-rechristen the instrument Sandy, Little
Orphan Annie' s dog, but this recommendat1on was not followed.

Another instrument consisted of two units, a boron-coated ioniza-

tion chamber which measured both neutron and gamma rays and a similar,

uncoated chamber which mecasured the gamma rays alone; from the difference

of the two readings the,neutron flux could be determined. The instru-

ments always traveled together and therefore the unit was named Chang

and Eng for the original Siamese twins.

for the sc1entlsts to 1nvent new terms In Cross section measurements the
4expre551on barn was 1ntroduced Thlsusmall surface 10-24 cm2 is "as big

~-guage at the birth of the atomic-age. During the experiment that

culmlnated on December 2, 1942 in the accomplishment of:the first-u
controlled nuclear chain reaction, a safety rod. was held by a rope
runnrngnthrough.the pile and weighted-on the opposite end. The young
physicist in charge was told to watch the indicator; if it exceeded a
certain value, he was to cut the rope and scram. Since then the term
scram is used to designate the emergency‘shutdown’of a reactor. Today
the urgency is lost and the word scram 1nd1cates simply a fast- shutdown

operation.' A few years ago the’ meetlng of “the international -

committee on nuclear terminology, a member of the Br1t1sh:delegation

expressed 'a strong dislike for -this word, calling it '"an inelegant:
American-slang term" and wanted to substitute emergency shutdown?*;

however, his face was red when during a subsequent visit of the com-

started in the field of nuclear terminology. Dr. H. Kowalski, a nuclear
scientistAtho is currently devoting his atténtion to problems of
terminology examined the problem of creation of new words at a con-
ference on linguistics; he listed several factors which influence the
devélopment of scientific and'engineering jargohzg. |

. The lingdiSt, the psychoiogist or the information specialist ﬁight
find in the nuclear language a rich field for investigation. Geographers
and historians try to reconstitute the way of life and sociai organiza-
tion of early-inhabifants of a region by studying the toponymy of his-
torical and geographic designations; in the same manner, editors and
indexers of'nuclearApublications.should scrutinize the habits of authors;
they should examine, for example, whether their systematic and techni-
cally correct terms are actually used by authors, speakers and working
engineers. .

The atomic age is still with us; many of us still remember its
birth, but it is fast becoming history. We should not lose this-
opportunity to examine carefully the linguistic residue of a giant
national and international effort while many persons who can shed
light on certain facets of the;problem are still alive. Such an effort .

remarks about ”scram" and "cr1t1cal", we obta1n a certa1n emot1onal |
satlsfactlon from the1r use they recall the "her01c” days of the.
nuclear f1eld when the researcher started his workday W1th the- thought
that he m1ght have to "scram” when the sc1ent15t armed with only a
screwdriver pushed ”subcr1t1cal" masses. of flss1onable mater1als in

an experiment called thstzng the dragon's tatZ 1nstead of watching
from the outs1de as ‘they are. driven together in shielded cells by remote

machlnery C11n1cally ster1le, logically correct terms are needed but

‘let us. not get rid of our. emot10nal herltage'.

I cannot c1a1m that I have done Just1ce to the language of nuclear .
science; it is 1mposs1b1e4to cover all facets ‘and’ ramlflcatlons of

the trade Jargon of ‘this highly spec1allzed f1eld ! haVe tried to;point

‘out the 1mpact of the vocabulary on our feellngs, -- the same - words

be1ng able to arouse fear and susp1c1on among the pub11c -- pride and
nostalgla among the practltloners. : | |

Wartime secrecy, gave birth to cover names but perhaps as a result
of . some feel1ng of "fair play” there was: always some connection between
the object and the verbal cloak.. Ordinary words assumed new.meanings |
wh1m51ca1 acronyms were created, while the time- honored Greek and Latin
roots were neglected - T | | ' ‘

A new "language” has been developed in the relatlvely short t1me'
of a quarter of-a century The f1eld is not ‘the youngest any more;
the space and computer sc1ences now have that d1$t1nct1on . But 1t
still dominates 1nternat1onal pol1t1cs and people who plan the future
of mank1nd count on its resources. What the pol1t1c1ans the planners
and, espeC1ally, the scientists and englneers “have to say. must be
~ clearly understood by everybody ' . |

In the portlon of his book quoted at the start of this paper
Isaac A51mov, the well known sc1ent1st SC1ence writer and author of
science-fiction stories, underl1nes the obllgatlon of scientists to
society and to the1r colleagues to make themselves understood They
must make sure that they will not lose touch with non- SC1ent1sts
that SC1ence Wlll not appear as "1ncomprehen51ble maglc” -

They owe it to the1r fellow sc1entlsts not to use terms wh1ch are
all-defined or cannot be understood by ‘a maJorlty of their aud1ence
or readers, otherW1se only words are transmltted 1nstead of knowl-
. edge. They must resist the. temptatlon to coin fancy words to cover
up hazy and unclear concepts. - |
1 would like to close by c1t1ng the now famous telephone message
~given by Arthur Compton from Chlcago after thlelrst self-sustaining
chain reaction was achieved, to James B. Conant at Harvard. It heralded
the beg1nn1ng of a new age for manklnd and it was 1nstantly understood
although the code was not prearranged31 |

”The Ital1an naV1gator has. 1anded in the new world"

said Compton. - "T' ) | |

"How- were the natives?"; asked Conant. -

""Very friendly'.
