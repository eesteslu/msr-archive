Introduction

The objective of the Molten-Salt Reactor Program
is the development of nuclear reactors which use
fluid fuels that are solutions of fissile and fertile
materials in suitable carrier salts. The program is
an outgrowth of the effort begun over 18 years ago
in the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion (ANP) program
to make a molten-salt reactor power plant for air-
craft. A molten-salt reactor — the Aircraft Reactor
Experiment — was operated at ORNL in 1954 as
part of the ANP program.

Our major goal now is to achieve a thermal
breeder reactor that will produce power at low cost
while simultaneously conserving and extending the
nation’s fuel resources. Fuel for this type of re-
actor would be 233UF, or ?*3UF, dissolved in a
salt that is a mixture of LiF and BeF,. The fer-
tile material would be ThF, dissolved in the same
salt or in a separate blanket salt of similar com-
position. The technology being developed for the
breeder is also applicable to advanced converter
reactors.

A major program activity is the operation of the
Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE). This re-
actor was built to test the types of fuels and ma-
terials that would be used in thermal breeder and
converter reactors and to provide experience with
the operation and maintenance of a molten-salt re-
actor. The MSRE operates at 1200°F and at atmos-
pheric pressure and produces about 8.0 Mw of heat.
The initial fuel contains 0.9 mole % UF ,, 5 mole %
ZtF,, 29 mole % BeF,, and 65 mole % LiF, and
the uranium is about 33% 23°U. The melting point
is 840°F.

The fuel circulates through a reactor vessel and
an external pump and heat exchange system. All
this equipment is constructed of Hastelloy N, a
nickel-molybdenum-chromium alloy with exceptional
resistance to corrosion by molten fluorides and
with high strength at high temperature. The reac-
tor core contains an assembly of graphite moderator
bars that are in direct contact with the fuel. The

Xi

graphite is a new material having high density and
small pore size. The fuel salt does not wet the
graphite and therefore does not enter the pores,
even at pressures well above the operating pres-
sure.

Heat produced in the reactor is transferred to a
coolant salt in the primary heat exchanger, and the
coolant salt is pumped through a radiator to dis-
sipate the heat to the atmosphere.

Design of the MSRE started early in the summer
of 1960, and fabrication of equipment began early
in 1962. The essential installations were com-
pleted, and prenuclear testing was begun in August
of 1964. Following prenuclear testing and some
modifications, the reactor was taken critical on
June 1, 1965, and zero-power experiments were
completed early in July. After additional modifi-
cations, maintenance, and sealing of the contain-
ment, operation at a power of 1 Mw began in Jan-
uary 1966.

At the 1-Mw power level, trouble was experienced
with plugging of small ports in control valves in
the off-gas system by heavy liquid and varnish-like
organic materials. These materials are believed
to be produced by radiation polymerization of a
very small amount of oil that vaporizes after leak-
ing through a gasketed seal into the tank of the
fuel circulating pump. This difficulty was over-
come by installing a specially designed filter in
the off-gas line.

Full power, about 8.0 Mw, was reached in May
1966, and the plant was operated at full power for
about six weeks. Then one of the radiator cool-
ing blowers (which were left over from the ANP
program) broke up from mechanical stress. While
new blowers were being procured, an array of
graphite and metal surveillance specimens was
taken from the core and examined.

Power operation was resumed in October with
one blower; then in November the second blower
was installed, and full power was again attained.
After a shutdown to remove salt that had acci-
dentally gotten into an off-gas line, the MSRE was
operated in December and January at full power for
30 days without interruption. The next power run
was begun later in January and was continued for
102 daysuntil terminated to remove a second set
of graphite and metal specimens. An additional
operating period of 46 days during the summer was
interrupted for maintenance work on the sampler-
enricher when the cable drive mechanism jammed.
In September 1967, a run was begun which con-

tinued for six months until terminated on schedule
in March 1968. Power operation during this run
had to be interrupted once when the reactor was
taken to zero power to repair an electrical short
in the sampler-enricher.

Completion of this six-month run brought to a
close the first phase of MSRE operation, in which
the objective was to demonstrate on a small scale
the attractive features and technical feasibility of
these systems for civilian power reactors. We be-
lieve this objective has been achieved and that
the MSRE has shown that molten fluoride reactors
can be operated at temperatures above 1200°F
without corrosive attack on either the metal or
graphite parts of the system, that the fuel iscom-
pletely stable, that reactor equipment can operate
satisfactorily at these conditions, that xenon can
be removed rapidly from molten salts, and that,
when necessary, the radioactive equipment can be
repaired or replaced.

The second phase of MSRE operation began in
August 1968 when a small facility in the MSRE
building was used to remove the original uranium
charge from the fuel salt by treatment with gaseous
F,. In six days of fluorination, 219 kg of uranium
was removed from the molten salt and loaded onto
absorbers filled with sodium fluoride pellets. The
decontamination and recovery of the uranium were
very good.

Highly pure 233U will next be added to the
present carrier salt, making the MSRE the world’s
first 233U-fueled reactor. Critical, low-power,

xii

and full-power tests will be performed to determine
the nuclear characteristics of the reactor with
233U fuel.

A large part of the Molten-Salt Reactor Program
is now being devoted to the requirements of future
molten-salt reactors. Conceptual design studies
are being made of large breeder reactors, and an
increasing amount of work on materials, on the
chemistry of fuel and coolant salts, and on process-
ing methods is included in the research and de-
velopment program.

For several years, most of our work on breeder
reactors was aimed specifically at two-fluid
systems in which graphite tubes would be used to
separate uranium-bearing fuel salts from thorium-
bearing fertile salts. We think attractive reactors
of this type can be developed, but several years
of experience with a prototype reactor would be
required to prove that graphite can serve as a
plumbing material while exposed to high fast-neu-
tron irradiations. As a consequence, a one-fluid
breeder has been a long-sought goal.

Two developments of the past year estab-
lished the feasibility of a one-fluid breeder. The
first was demonstration of the chemical steps in a
process which uses liquid bismuth to extract prot-
actinium and uranium selectively from a salt that
also contains thorium. The second was the recog-
nition that a fertile blanket can be obtained with a
salt that contains uranium and thorium by reducing
the graphite-to-fuel ratio in the outer part of the
core. Our studies show that a one-fluid, two-region
breeder can be built that has fuel utilization
characteristics approaching those of our two-fluid
designs, and probably better economics. Since the
graphite serves only as moderator, the one-fluid re-
actor is more nearly a scaleup of the MSRE.

These features caused us to change the em-
phasis of our breeder program from the two-fluid to
the one-fluid breeder. Most of our design and de-
velopment effort is now directed to the one-fluid
system.
Summary

PART 1. MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR
EXPERIMENT

1. MSRE Operations

Run 14, which began in September 1967, was
terminated as scheduled on March 26. Fuel salt
had been in the core continuously for 188 days,
and the reactor had been critical 98% of the time.
Shutdown was for the purpose of removing speci-
mens from the core, investigating fission product
retention in the fuel salt and off-gas systems,
performing some maintenance, and stripping the
uranium from the salt in preparation for addition
of 233y.

In the first two weeks of the shutdown, gamma
spectrometric measurements were made on equip-
ment in the reactor cell, the fuel off-gas line was
opened and a section replaced, two heater units
from the primary heat exchanger were repaired,
and the core specimen array was removed, reas-
sembled with some new specimens, and reinstalled.

Two weeks before the end of the run the fuel
sampler-enricher cable had become tangled. After
the fuel was drained, the manipulator was used to
untangle the cable, but in the process the sample
capsule and key were dropped into the pump bowl.
Tests in a mockup showed permanent magnets to
be a most effective retrieval device, but efforts
in the pump bowl were not successful. The cor-
roded top of a capsule dropped eight months
earlier was recovered, but the other capsule was
apparently lodged irretrievably. Later tests showed
that samples could still be obtained.

Shakedown tests of the fluorine disposal system
in the processing plant led to abandonment of the
original SO, F , gaseous reaction system in favor of
reaction of fluorine with a caustic solution. Work
with this system delayed salt processing until
August 1. Once started, processing went rapidly

Xiii

and efficiently. The flush salt was fluorinated
and treated to reduce corrosion products. By
the end of August the fuel salt had been fluorinated
to recover the 219 kg of uranium as UF , on NaF
pellets.
Laboratory measurements of coolant salt heat
capacity cleared up discrepancies between air
and salt heat balances at the MSRE.:
mum power is 8.0 Mw rather than the 7.2 Mw
indicated earlier by salt heat balances. Revision
of burnup and other terms in the reactivity balance
resulted in the net change in the residual term
being only 0.2% &k/k in 72,000 Mwhr of operation
with 23%U. Tests showed that the dynamics
characteristics had not changed during that time.
Random noise in the neutron flux correlated with
a circulating bubble fraction of about 0.1 vol %.
The new heat-balance power raised the observed
heat transfer coefficient in the primary heat ex-
changer to 10% above the design value. No change
occurred over the two years of **5U power opera-

the maxi-

tion.

The system for measuring contaminant levels
in the fuel off-gas was operated briefly at the end
of the run.

During the shutdown the component cooling sys-
tem was overhauled and improved. Otherwise,
the required maintenance was relatively minor.

2. Component Development

Operation of the freeze-flange thermal-cycle
test was continued through 268 cycles, after which
it was shut down for inspection of the flanges.
Inspection with dye penetrant showed indications
of fatigue failure only in the bore region of the
male flange where the alignment stub is welded to
the face of the flange. The containment integrity
of the joint was not affected.
Xiv

Gamma-spectroscopic measurements of fission
products deposited on metal surfaces of the primary
system revealed that °>Nb, °°Mo, !°3Ru, and !*?Te
with its daughter '3?I were predominant in the heat
exchanger in the period from 3 to 17 days after
shutdown. Gamma source photographs of com-
ponents in the reactor cell, made with a pinhole
camera, disclosed the location of several radiation
“hot spots.”’

The preoperational check-out of the Mark 2 fuel
pump test neared completion.

3. Instruments and Controls

Three of fifteen new relays in the rod scram
coincidence matrix failed due to stuck contacts
within four months of installation. Another fission
chamber was replaced; the average service of these
chambers is proving to be about three months.
Simulator tests showed the rod control system to
be adequate for 233U operation.

Startup of the salt processing system involved
some new instruments and controls and numerous
modifications.

4. MSRE Reactor Analysis

The correction factor for delayed neutron
effectiveness which accounts for differences in
emission energies was recalculated after an
improved model for determining the difference in
average age to thermal energies between prompt
and delayed neutrons became available. The

““absolute’’ to ‘‘effective’’

correction factor from
delayed neutron fraction was calculated to be
1.086, about 5% higher than earlier calculations
had given. This has the effect of increasing the
rod worth measured by reactor periods and the
values of reactivity coefficients that were meas-
ured relative to the rod worth. The agreement
between calculated and measured reactivity
coefficients was improved, but the difference
between measured and predicted rod worth was
increased.

The transient time response and the frequency
response of the reactor to reactivity perturbations
were calculated using characteristics of the
system with 233U fuel. Stability analyses using
several techniques showed that the system will
be stable at all power levels and that the degree
of stability will increase with increasing power
level.

PART 2. MSBR DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
5. Design

The design study of a single-fluid MSBR power
station was continued, but with the plant capacity
changed to 1000 Mw (electrical) to be consistent
with current design studies of other reactors. The
shape and arrangement of the graphite elements
in the core were changed to provide an under-
moderated ‘‘blanket’’ region at the top and sides
of the core to conserve neutrons. This blanket
space at the sides is filled with 4-in.-diam
graphite spheres.

For the periodic replacement of graphite it was
decided to remove the entire core as an assembly
rather than to move a few graphite elements at a
time. This change made it possible to eliminate a
grid formerly used to space the graphite pieces in
the core. The graphite is now contained in a
Hastelloy N ‘‘basket’’ in which the moderator can
be preassembled and attached to a spare top reactor
vessel head to allow the core substitution to be
made more quickly. The maintenance equipment
required for graphite replacement received
preliminary study and appears to be feasible.

The method of supporting the primary system
equipment was changed to hanging it from the cell
roof structure. Expansion loops are now used to
achieve the necessary flexibility in the secondary
system lines.

A new flowsheet was prepared to show revised
flow rates and to include some of the auxiliary
systems, such as the drain tank heat rejection
system, the off-gas systems, etc. A freeze valve
will be used on the primary system drain line.
Provisions will be made upstream of the valve
for circulating the salt to avoid overheating; the
drain line will be drained downstream of the
valve. A catch basin has been provided beneath
the reactor system to collect any primary salt
spilled in an accident and to direct it to the
primary drain tank through a bismuth seal
in a U-trap. This arrangement would prevent
spilled secondary salt from entering the primary
drain tank.

A code for optimizing the performance of the
primary heat exchangers was completed. Revised
physical property data for the salts also became
available, and the first results indicate that four
units with about 5700 3/8-ir1.-0D tubes each will
be required. Studies of the related vibration and
stress problems are not yet complete, however,
and further revision may be required. Maintenance
on a primary heat exchanger would be by substitu-
tion of a tube bundle rather than by repair of an
individual tube.

6. Reactor Physics

A new reactor optimization code, ROD, was
developed to replace OPTIMERC. The principal
improvements incorporated in the new code include
(1) multiple thermal-neutron groups, (2) the capa-
bility of using different spectrum-averaged cross
sections of a particular nuclide in different regions
of the reactor, and (3) a better calculation of two-
dimensional neutronic effects by synthesizing two
one-dimensional calculations.

A constrained optimization calculation of the
one-fluid MSBR was performed with ROD utilizing
the improvements described above. Basically
a two-region reactor was considered. Processing
rates were fixed. With these restrictions all
salt volume fractions and reactor dimensions
were optimized with respect to annual fuel yield.
The results of the calculation indicate that a
breeding ratio of 1.07, an annual fuel yield of
4%, and a graphite lifetime of 1.8 years (without
power flattening) are achievable with this reactor
concept.

Survey calculations were performed on a single-
fluid core moderated with graphite balls rather
than prismatic elements. The maximum annual
fuel yield achievable with a random packed bed
of graphite balls is less than 2%. The inventory
charges are typically 0.3 to 0.4 mill/kwhr (elec-
trical), and the graphite lifetime is from three
to six years.

Some preliminary calculations indicate that the
peak damage flux and power density of a large
MSBR and a breeding ratio greater than unity
with 233U fuel can be achieved in a breeder
experiment that would operate at a power
level less than 200 Mw (thermal).

7. Systems and Component Development
The proposal for using circulating helium bubbles

for stripping noble gases from the fuel salt was
altered to permit recirculation of the bubbles so

Xv

that the volumetric throughput of the helium in the
gas system is reduced. It was found that the
bubbles could recirculate ten times before they
must be removed because of an approach to
saturation. Because of the uncertainty in some
of the parameters governing the efficiency of
removal of '35Xe by the use of circulating bubbles,
it may be necessary to plan on coating the
graphite so that the target '35Xe poison fraction
can be achieved. The method for generating the
bubbles has moved toward a fluid-powered
generator where the gas is injected through small
holes in the throat of a venturi; the bubbles are
to be removed by a pipeline separator which uses
a swirl generator to produce a high gravitational
field and a gas-filled vortex to which the bubbles
migrate. A working model using water as the
circulation fluid has been operated with flows

of up to 660 gpm, and the only problem is in
stabilizing the vortex.

About 950 hr of intermittent circulating time
were accumulated before draining the flushing
charge of salt from the sodium fluoroborate test
facility. The loop is now being operated with a
fresh batch of NaBF ,. Head-flow data are in good
agreement with prior data for water and NaK. Test
values for the minimum pressure necessary to
suppress cavitation agreed closely with predicted
values for the new batch of salt, but were
significantly higher than the predicted values in
the case of the flushing salt. The difference was
ascribed to the impurities in the flushing salt.
Operations were interrupted from time to time
by gas line restrictions which were caused by a
variety of materials. Analytical investigations
are under way to determine the nature and source
of each of the materials involved. Several in-
gassing transients occurred during performance
of the cavitation tests. Pieces of green salt,
rich in U and Th, were found when the pump
was opened for inspection. Neither the green
salt nor the ingassing transients are considered
to have adverse implications regarding use of
NaBF4 in the MSRE coolant system.

The basic plan for obtaining fuel-salt and
coolant -salt pumps for the MSBE was outlined.
The first draft of the MSBE fuel-salt pump
specifications was prepared and reviewed.

A study was made of the effect of pump speed
on the conflicting requirements for a low net
positive suction head (NPSH) and a low fuel salt
inventory for the MSBR fuel salt pumps. Preliminary

investigations were made to determine the required
thickness of the nuclear shield plug for the MSBR
fuel salt pump.

Consideration is being given to using one basic
pump design for the MSBR fuel- and coolant-salt
pumps because of the similarity in the pumping
requirements. Differences in head requirements
could be accommodated by modifying the impeller
diameter and speed. Preliminary design of a
molten-salt pump test facility capable of testing
the fuel-salt pumps and the coolant-salt pumps
for the MSBE has advanced sufficiently to permit
sizing the major loop components. The test
system will contain approximately 200 ft* of salt.

The final report on the rotor dynamic feasibility
studies for long-shaft pump configurations has been
received from Mechanical Technology Incorporated.
The molten-salt bearing program has been temporar-
ily curtailed because the single-fluid reactor
concept will permit the use of a short-shaft pump
configuration, which ordinarily does not require
a salt-lubricated shaft support bearing.

An outline of a program to develop steam
generators for the Molten-Salt Breeder Experiment
was prepared and includes a facility for testing
full-scale tubes. The facility will have a heating
capacity of up to 3 Mw (thermal) at a molten-salt
temperature of 1200°F.

A program designed to establish the feasibility
of remotely cutting, beveling, and welding radio-
active pipe and vessel closures was begun.

8. MSBR Instrumentation and Controls

The analysis of the dynamic behavior of the
molten-salt breeder reactor system was continued,
with emphasis on the overall plant control problem.
Specific control problems associated with the
dynamics of the steam generator as well as the
problems of integrated control of the entire heat
transfer system from reactor to turbine throttle
were investigated. Several basic control schemes
were tried, and the results are given. Future
studies will include control of the temperature
of the primary salt by using reactivity control.

Calculations were made of the neutron density
as a function of time following step reductions in
reactivity in the single-fluid MSBR. The results
of some of these calculations are given and can

be used in the determination of the heat removal
requirements after reactor shutdown.

To determine the suitability of a recently
marketed high-temperature resistance thermometer
for use in precise measurement of temperatures
and differential temperatures in molten-salt
systems, two sets of thermometers were purchased
and are being evaluated. Results of tests to date
indicate that the calibration of the thermometers
is stable below 1200°F and that calibration shifts
occur above 1200°F that increase in magnitude
with increasing temperature. Extended operation
of the thermometers at 1500°F (the highest temper-
ature for which they were rated) very nearly
restored the original calibration and effectively
stabilized the thermometers for operation at all
temperatures within rating. Attempts to stabilize
the thermometers and restore the original calibra-
tion by extended operation at temperatures less

than 1500°F were much less effective.

9. Heat Transfer and Physical Properties

Heat Transfer. — An apparatus for studying the
heat transfer characteristics of molten salts was
assembled. In this system, the salt is induced to
flow through an electrically heated small-diameter
tube by applying gas pressure alternately to salt
reservoirs located at each end of the test section.
Initial experiments were conducted with the
proposed MSBR single-region fuel mixture (LiF-
BeF -ThF ,-UF , 67.5-20-12.0-0.5 mole %) at
Reynolds moduli between 700 and 20,000, heat
fluxes from 3 x 10% to 6 x 10° Btu hr—! ft~2,
and mean fluid temperatures between 1230 and
1510°F. Wall-temperature patterns were unex-
pectedly different from those observed in earlier
studies with molten salts. In the laminar flow
regime, the heat transfer was in reasonable
agreement with accepted empirical correlation.

In the high transition to turbulent flow regime,
a laminar-turbulent transition was suggested by
the wall-temperature data. Further experiments
and/or apparatus modifications will be effected
to understand the observed phenomena.

Thermophysical Properties. — A variable-gap
apparatus was used to obtain preliminary values
for the thermal conductivities of three molten
fluoride mixtures. For the MSRE coolant (LiF-
BeF ,, 66-34 mole %), the conductivity fell
in the range 0.010 to 0.012 w ecm™ ! (°C)~!
Xvii

between 500 and 900°C; for the MSRE fuel (LiF-
BeF ,-ZrF , -UF ,, 71.2-23-5-0.8 mole %), k was

0.012 w em~! (°C)~! at 500°C, showed a maxi-
mum of 0.015 w em™ ' (°C)~ ! at 700°C, and
returned to 0.012 w em ™! (°C)~ ! at 900°C. Despite
difficulties with BF , loss and thermocouple lead
wire inhomogeneities, the total scatter for three
sets of measurements with a proposed MSBR
coolant (NaF-NaBF , 8-92 mole %) was less than
1+13%; the conductivity was found to decrease
nearly linearly from 0.0053 to 0.0039 w cm~! (°C)~*
between 400 and 800°C. Although the apparatus
being used was designed to minimize errors in
measurements with salts having conductivities

in the range 0.05t0 0.10 wem="' (°C)~! — an
order of magnitude above the conductivities of

the salts currently under study — corrected data
should ultimately have an uncertainty of less

than £15%. A planned new apparatus should

result in further improved accuracy.

The enthalpy of the MSRE coolant mixture
(LiF-BeF ,, 66-34 mole %) was obtained using
a copper-block drop calorimeter. The derived
heat capacity was 0.577 cal g~ ! (°C)~! +1.4%
over the temperature span 500 to 720°C.

Methods for predicting the thermal conductivities
of molten-salt mixtures were surveyed, and
estimated values were compared with experimental
results. It was found that the equation developed
by Rao yielded conductivities that were in excel-
lent agreement with the chloride and nitrate data
but were only adequate for fluoride mixtures.
Several possible reasons for this latter discrepancy
were that (1) the theory was based on single-
component liquids and (2) the fluoride mixture
data still contain large uncertainties.

Mass Transfer to Circulating Bubbles. — A
proposed scheme for removing fission product
gases from MSBR fuel salts involves stripping
135%e in the region outside the reactor core
with cocirculating small helium bubbles. An
experiment to provide initial data for establishing
the feasibility of this technique is in an advanced
stage of design. Helium bubbles will be used to
remove dissolved oxygen (simulating '*3Xe) from
room-temperature glycerol-water solutions (simulat-
ing molten salt); this system possesses dynamic
similarity with presently conceived MSBR designs.
Methods are being developed for measuring the
size and distribution of small helium bubbles in

a flowing stream and for introducing and removing
these bubbles.

PART 3. CHEMISTRY
10. Chemistry of the MSRE

Chemical analyses of the MSRE fuel and coolant
salts continued to show that the chemical stability
of these salts in use is excellent, that generalized
corrosion of the MSRE containment system was
negligible during the current report period, and
that analytical chemical methods were effective in
confirming nuclear performance. The previous
disparity noted between nominal values of uranium
in the fuel salt and those obtained by chemical
analysis was resolved by new and higher values
for the heat capacity of the coolant salt. Recom-
puted values for the nominal concentrations of
uranium now fall within +0.1% of chemical values.

The feasibility of starting molten-salt reactors
with plutonium trifluoride was evaluated, Com-
patibility in such reactors is moderately well
assured but requires confirmation of the solubility
of PuF , and oxide tolerance before tests can be
made using the MSRE.

11. Fission Product Behavior

The fate of fission products in the MSRE was
further explored by study of a third set of graphite
and Hastelloy N long-term surveillance specimens
obtained after the March 25, 1968, shutdown. Three
of the CGB graphite specimens had been exposed
from 7800 to 64,000 Mwhr rather than from 32,000
to 64,000 Mwhr as was true of the other nine
graphite specimens. Surprisingly, the doubly
exposed graphite did not receive any heavier
deposition of long-lived nuclides like '°®Ru than
the singly exposed. Although the concentration
profiles for fission products were different for the
four kinds of graphite studied, there was sur-
prisingly little difference in the total deposition
per unit area. The outer portion of the graphite
was partially permeated by the fission products.
The deposition behavior indicated that the fission
products did not travel together. The deposition
on metal was lower than previously encountered
by a factor of about 3.

An alternate method, involving grinding as a
means of sampling graphite surveillance speci-
mens, confirmed the results obtained by milled
samples. An analysis of surveillance specimen
for Li and F indicated that fuel salt, in minute
amounts, permeated far into the graphite. Be-
cause some of the fission products behaved as
though they were dispersed colloidially, a study
of the behavior of colloids in molten salts was
undertaken.

12. Physical Chemistry of Molten Salts

Kinetic studies of the disproportionation of
MoF | showed that low partial pressures of MoF
favor production of MoF ., whereas at pressures of
~1 atmosphere, MoF , is formed.

In continuing evaluations of alkali fluoroborates
as secondary coolants in molten-salt reactors,
studies of the NaF-KF-BF ; phase equilibria
examined the ideality of solution behavior. The
possibility that hydroxyfluoroborates play a
significant role as contaminants in fluoroborate
melts has led to efforts to synthesize and
characterize the pure phases. The structure of
crystalline NaBF4 was shown to consist of
slightly irregular BF,~ tetrahedra. The sodium
ions are coordinated by eight fluoride ions which
are at the corners of an irregular polyhedron.
Thermochemical data were obtained for NaBF4,
KBF4, and KF‘—KBF4 mixtures. Densities of the
possible coolant salt mixture NaF-NaBF | (8-92
mole %) were measured for the temperature range
439 to 508°C and are given by the equation
(g cm™3) = 2.27 — 7.4 x 10~* ¢ (°C).

The solubility of cerium trifluoride, a useful
proxy for PuF ,, was measured in LiF-BeFZ-ThF4
solvents. The results indicated that the solubility
of PuF  in such melts will be adequate to fuel
a molten-salt reactor based on PuF , as a fissile
agent.

Refined values for the solubility of thorium
metal in molten LiF-ThF4 mixtures were obtained
which are slightly lower, that is, between 0.3 and
1.0 mole % at 620°C, than previously reported.
Evidence for a solid of the alleged formula ThOF
was examined and found to be without merit. The
heat content of LiF—BeFZ-ThF4 (72-16-12 mole %)
was obtained experimentally for the temperature
range 25 to 750°C. The electrical conductivities
of molten LiF-BeF , mixtures were determined
in relation to temperature characteristics for
compositions ranging from 38 to 52 mole % BeF ,.

xviii

The electrical conductivities of ThF - and
NaBF4-based fluoride mixtures were estimated for
the molten state.

Continued efforts were given to development of
reference electrodes based on Be®/Be? " and
Ni2*/Ni® half cells for use with molten fluorides.
Preliminary results in which stable potentials
were achieved for periods of up to 24 hr indicate
the feasibility of developing such electrodes.

Spectral studies were conducted successfully
with fluoride melts contained in diamond window
cells. Spectrochemical methods were employed
in studies of the coordination chemistry and
disproportionation kinetics of the molybdenum
fluorides.

Distribution of U** between molten fluoride
mixtures and (U,Th)O2 solid solutions was
examined with respect to its potential as a fuel
reprocessing method. Tetravalent uranium was
found to distribute strongly to the oxide solid
solution phase.

In continuing studies of the pressures of SiF
in equilibrium with molten Li BeF , crystalline
Be2SiO4, and SiOz, equilibrium data were obtained
for higher BeO/Si0O,, ratios than had been measured
previously. As a result, the chemistry of silica in
LiF-BeF , melts is now well defined.

13. Chemistry of Molten-Salt Reactor
Fuel Reprocessing Technology

Current results of laboratory-scale experiments
continue to demonstrate the feasibility of extracting
protactinium, uranium, and the rare earths from
molten fluoride fuels by reductive methods. Extrac-
tion of protactinium at tracer levels from a one-
fluid breeder reactor fuel was demonstrated.

Several variables, for example, salt and metal
phase composition and concentration of contami-
nants, were investigated in relation to their
effects on the distribution of protactinium and the
rare earths between salt and metal phases.

14. Development and Evaluation of Analytical
Methods for Molten-Salt Reactors

Oxide concentrations in the MSRE fuel, as
determined by the hydrofluorination method,
remained near the 50-ppm level. The essentially
identical result obtained in the analysis of a
X1X

sample maintained at an elevated temperature to
minimize radiolysis proved that the radioactivity
of the samples does not produce a negative bias

in the results. Oxide was also determined on
LiF-BeF , preparations and on samples of LiF -
UF, from the production of 233y fuel concentrates.
These latter samples required the development of
new sampling techniques and the adaptation of

the method to smaller samples and to new forms

of sample containers. An evaluation of the
operating history of the hot-cell apparatus for
oxide indicated that electrolytic moisture-monitor
cells are desensitized rapidly during the analysis
of highly radioactive samples; however, similar
desensitization of a test cell could not be produced
by exposure to radioactivity of comparable and
higher levels. All current and previous results

of the determinations of the U3*/U* * ratio in the
MSRE fuel were reevaluated by means of a modified
computer program that calculates ratios at the
operating temperature of the reactor rather than at
the lower temperatures at which the analyses

were performed. With the exception of three low
results, apparently associated with samples of

the highest activity, the recomputed ratios are in
reasonable agreement with the ratios calculated on
the basis of the operating history of the reactor
(i.e., beryllium additions, corrosion-product
increases, and allowance for burnup). A method
for the remote measurement of traces of HF in gas
streams has been developed to cover the range

of concentrations (8 to 400 ppm) found in hydrogen-
transpiration effluents. The method is based on
the preconcentration of the HF on an NakF trap

and thermal-conductivity measurement of the pulse
of HF generated on desorption. The hydrogen-
evolution method, which is a measure of both
U(IID) and dispersed electropositive metals, is
being modified for adaptation to radioactive samples
of reprocessed MSRE fuel solvent. To avoid loss
of reducing power during pulverizations, sample
fragments are dissolved in HCI-HBO, at 250°C

in a sealed tube.

The electrochemical oxidation of U(IV) in
molten LiF-BeF -ZrF  has been studied. Ex-
perimental evidence indicates that the U(V)
which is formed subsequently disproportionates
into UIV) and U(VI). Kinetic constants for
the proposed nickel-nickel(Il) reference electrode
were measured in both LiF-BeF -ZrF  and LiF-

NaF-KF systems by a voltage step method. The

most significant of these constants, the molar
exchange current, was found to be sufficiently
large (2 amp/cm?), which ensures that no
polarization will occur during practical analytical
measurements. The disproportionation of U(V)
generated at a pyrolytic graphite anode was
studied by chronopotentiometric methods. A

rate constant of approximately 160 liters mole !
sec™! was determined. The electrochemical
reduction of Cr(II) was also studied in LiF-

BeF -ZrF, by conventional and first-derivative
voltammetry. Although U(IV) interferes to some
extent, it is believed that the chromium reduction
wave can be used to monitor chromium in fluoride
melts.

The designing of the in-cell equipment of a
facility for spectral studies of highly radioactive
materials is essentially complete, and some of
these components are now being fabricated. This
equipment will permit the transfer of samples of
radioactive fluoride salts to spectrophotometric
cells without exposure of the samples to the
atmosphere and will simultaneously maintain them
at a temperature sufficient to eliminate significant
radiolysis.

The study of the spectra of Fe(Il), Ni(Il), Cr(II),
and Cr(III) in various LiF-BeF , melts has been
concluded. Solvent contaminants, primarily
products of hydrolysis, have been found to greatly
affect the electrochemical generation of solute
species for spectral characterization. Vacuum
pretreatment of LiF-NaF-KF at 450°C is effective
in removing the H, O precursor of these contami-
nants. The electrochemical generation of tantalum
and copper in their various oxidation states for
spectral study is presently being investigated.

Work was continued on the stabilization of a
helium breakdown detector for a gas chromatograph
for MSRE blanket gases. Controlled additions of
mercury vapor and hydrogen did not produce
adequate stabilization, but xenon appears more
promising. The thermal conductivity system
installed in the gas sampling station at the MSRE
was found to be subject to interference from the
radiolysis of water absorbed in the reagents used
to trap water and CO,. This trap has been replaced
with a small regenerable trap packed with
molecular sieve.

A collimating system was constructed to permit
the scanning of fission products deposited on the
surface of components of the MSRE. By the use
of a detector of improved resolution, Ge(Li) diode,
it was possible to identify and measure the
distribution of ten nuclides. Quantitative meas-
urements were reported for four major fission
products. The improved detector was used also
to measure the penetration of fission products

in MSRE and pyrolytic graphite specimens.

The precision of the determination of 235U by
delayed-neutron counting was improved to
approximately 0.2%, about a factor of 2, by steps
taken to define the irradiation and counting
periods more precisely. A repetitive scan
polarographic technique was found to provide
uranium measurements with 0.1% precision; how-
ever, the method is subject to a pronounced
negative bias. A new method under development
for the more precise determination of uranium in
MSRE fuel is based on the volatilization of uranium
from 50-g samples of UF , which can then be
collected on NaF, dissolved, and measured in the

absence of interfering ions. An apparatus to
perform this fluorination in a hot cell is now being
used to separate uranium for isotopic ratio deter-
minations. Before collection, the UF  is passed
over NaF at 400°C to reduce the radioactivity of
the product. The activity of the product traps has
been approximately 20 millirems, a level which
permits removal from the hot cell for precise
determination of the collected uranium.

A proton reaction method was used to measure
"Li and '°F concentrations in graphite exposed
to nonradioactive MSRE fuel, graphite taken from
the MSRE, and a graphite specimen that was
taken from the thermal convection loop in the
ORR. The technique offers the advantage of high
sensitivity and good selectivity.

PART 4. MOLTEN-SALT IRRADIATION
EXPERIMENTS

15. Molten-Salt Convection Loop in the ORR

Examinations of the graphite from the second
ORR convection loop showed that the salt had
wetted the graphite, contrary to experience in the
MSRE. Subsequent laboratory investigations of
cover gas purity effects on wetting of graphite by
salt have shown that extremely minute concentra-
tions of moisture (<1 ppm) promote wetting at
points of three-phase contact of salt, graphite,
and gas. Graphite immersed in salt in contact with

such atmospheres is not wetted. The results
suggest that the ORR loop graphite was wetted
during the multiple sample-withdrawal drain opera-
tion in which tank argon containing 4 ppm moisture
was used to manipulate the salt. In future experi-
ments additional gas purification immediately
preceding contact with salt must be provided.

The observed importance of the three-phase
contact area also suggests that moisture-promoted
wetting is limited to the graphite surface, since
the salt in the graphite surface will prevent
moisture-containing gas from getting to a deeper
contact area and furthering the penetration.

16. Gamma lrradiation of Fluoroborate

A second Hastelloy N capsule containing an
NaBF ,-NaF mixture (92-8 mole %) was irradiated
for 1460 hr at 600°C in three successive spent
HFIR fuel elements. The measured gamma dose
rate to the molten salt averaged 0.15 w/g, with
a maximum of 0.5 w/g; this compares with
estimated intensities of 0.02 and 0.25 w/g for
MSRE and MSBR heat exchangers respectively.
No deleterious effects were observable during
operation or in subsequent detailed examinations
of the Hastelloy N, salt, and residual gas; the
results were all comparable with those observed
with a previously operated out-of-pile control.

Considerations of the effects of delayed
neutron fluences due to the reaction

10BF3+n _— 7LiF+a+F2

indicate that the consequent fluorine generation
will be tolerably low.

17. Examination of MSRE Off-Gas Jumper Line

The jumper section of the MSRE off-gas line,
located 2 ft downstream from the pump bowl, was
recovered for examination after run 14 to determine
what substances, other than Kr-Xe daughters, are
transferred from the system by the off-gas. All
internal surfaces were covered with a thin, soot-
like film, and no other deposits were found. A
quantity of black dust was recovered from each
end. This consisted largely of fine particles of
fuel salt together with fission products and
carbonaceous material believed to result from
decomposition of lubricating oil which leaked
into the pump bowl. Uranium was shown to be
transferred only as an ingredient of the fuel salt
particles, which are believed to be fine spray
droplets.

A group of fission products, largely ‘‘noble
metals’’ (Mo, Ru, Ag, Te) and iodine, which is
the daughter of Te, were present in quantities
several hundred times the inventory proportion of
salt present, thus substantiating earlier hypotheses
that ‘“‘noble metals’’ could be transferred in the
off-gas. The proportions of Mo, Ru, Ag, Te, and I
were only moderately below those of the Kr-Xe
daughter isotopes (St, Y, Cs, and Ba). Definite
but smaller proportions of niobium were found.
Isotopes of Zr, Nd, and Ce, which form very stable
fluorides, did not exceed the inventory proportion
of salt.

PART 5. MATERIALS DEVELOPMENT
18. MSRE Surveillance Program

Hastelloy N and graphite surveillance samples
were removed from the MSRE after 72,400 Mwhr
of operation. The samples were in excellent
condition and were very compatible with their
service environment. The damaging fluence on
the graphite is only of the order of 102!
neutrons/cm?, and the property and dimensional
changes are small. The Hastelloy N vessel has
been exposed to a thermal fluence of the order
of 10! neutrons/cm?, and the mechanical
properties have deteriorated but appear sufficient
for continued operation.

19. Graphite Studies

We have obtained several types of graphite from
commercial vendors and from the Chemical
Engineering Development Department of the Y-12
Plant that are of interest for future MSBR’s and
for broadening our understanding of radiation
damage in graphite. OQur evaluation of the products

XX1

involves the measurement of physical and mechanical

properties as well as dimensional changes during
irradiation. Several graphites have been irradiated
to 1.3 x 1022 neutrons/cm? (> 50 kev) at 750°C.
Although higher fluences are required to determine

whether any of these materials has improved
lifetime, several graphites do show the type of
dimensional-change—fluence behavior that we
believe is desirable.

We plan to reduce the surface diffusivity of
graphite to <1078 cm?/sec to prevent the absorp-
tion of '?5Xe. We believe that this is best done
by impregnating the surface of graphite with
pyrocarbon and have worked out a potential process
using an alternating vacuum—1,3-butadiene
atmosphere at 800 to 1000°C. Penetrations up
to 15 mils were obtained, and the surface dif-
fusivity was reduced to <10~ ! cm?/sec.

Several samples are presently being irradiated
to determine whether the low permeability is
retained. We have investigated sealing the
graphite with molybdenum, but find that the
allowable quantity of <0.0002 in. is not suf-
ficient to reduce the permeability to <1078
cm?/sec.

20. Hastelloy N

We have continued the development of our
titanium-modified Hastelloy N and have procured
one large 5000-1b melt for evaluation. Postir-
radiation creep-rupture tests show that the
properties measured at 650°C are good as long
as the irradiation temperature is not above
650°C. This variation in properties appears to
be related to a change in the carbide from
Ti(C,N,B) at 650°C to Mo, C above 700°C. This
same transformation occurs in the absence of
irradiation and results in changes in the
mechanical properties. The weldability of the
titanium-modified alloy seems good, although we
have found that our large 5000-1b heat does not
make good filler metal for welding.

Our corrosion studies have shown that the new
coolant salt sodium fluoroborate and Hastelloy N
are reasonably compatible. The sodium fluoroborate
seems more aggressive than the other fluoride
salts that we have studied previously, but the
high corrosion rate may be due to impurities.
Moisture was admitted accidentally into our thermal
convection loops, and the corrosion rate increased
dramatically.

21. Graphite-to-Metal Joining

The two-fluid MSBR concept required a graphite-

to-Hastelloy N joint. We have developed two
techniques for making this joint, one involving
brazing and the other using a graded joint where
W-Ni-Fe alloys of variable composition are used
to bridge the gap in thermal expansion between
graphite and Hastelloy N. Several joints of both
designs have been made and thermal cycled to
demonstrate their soundness. An inspection
technique has been developed for the brazed
joint.

22. Support for Components Development Program

In anticipation of needing to make welds in
irradiated materials, we made fusion passes in
several tensile samples removed from the MSRE.
The welds have as good properties as the ir-
radiated base metal, but there seems to be some
additional difficulty in getting sound welds in the
irradiated material.

PART 6. MOLTEN-SALT PROCESSING
AND PREPARATION

23. Measurement of Distribution Coefficients
in Molten-Salt—Metal Systems

Distribution of uranium, protactinium, thorium,
and rare earths between molten fluoride salts and
lithium-bismuth solutions is being studied in sup-
port of reductive extraction processes for single-
fluid MSR fuels. Distribution coefficient data
for protactinium were obtained using LiF-BeF -
ThF , (69.2-19.4-11.4 mole %) as the salt phase
at 600°C. These data, combined with earlier
results, show that the uranium-protactinium
separation factor is about 100 and that the
protactinium-thorium separation factor is about
4300. Other experiments established that the
solubility of protactinium in bismuth is at least
2000 ppm at 550°C and that bismuth solutions
containing at least 1000 ppm of both protactinium
and thorium can be produced at 600°C. These
results establish the chemical feasibility of the
protactinium isolation portion of the proposed
process. Data from other experiments showed
that lanthanum and europium could be separated
from thorium, but that the separation factors
generally were in the range of 1 to 3. The

xxii

highest separation factors were obtained when
the mole fraction ratio LiF/(2BeF , + 3’I‘hF4)
was high.

The solubility of thorium in bismuth was
determined in the temperature range of 480 to
815°C. The data can be expressed as

log S (ppm) = —3850/T(°K) + 7.677 .

24. Simulated Molten-Salt—Liquid-Bismuth
Contactor Studies

Equipment is needed to efficiently contact
streams of salt and bismuth. Since the available
correlations for design of liquid-liquid extraction
systems are based on conditions far removed from
those of interest, data are being obtained with a
water-mercury system, which more closely re-
sembles a salt-bismuth system. Measurements of
flooding, holdup, and pressure drop have been
made in a 1-in.-ID column using several packing
sizes.

25. Reductive Extraction Engineering Studies

Equipment is being installed for semicontinuous
experiments on reductive extraction. The transfer
of uranium from a salt to a metal stream will be
studied in a system containing a 0.82-in.-ID x
2-ft-long column packed with 1/4-in. right circular
cylinders of molybdenum. The experiments will
use 15-liter batches of molten salt and bismuth;
effluent streams from the column can be sampled
during the experiments.

26. Continuous Fluorination of Molten Salt

Equipment is being developed for the continuous
removal of UF , from a salt stream by counter-
currently contacting the salt with F, in a salt-
phase-continuous system. The equipment will
be protected from corrosion by freezing a layer
of salt on the vessel wall; the heat necessary
for maintaining molten salt adjacent to frozen
salt will be provided by the decay of fission
products in the salt stream. A series of experi-
ments was recently concluded using countercurrent
flow of salt and an inert gas in a 5-in.-diam, 8-ft-
high column having an internal heat source.
xxiii

These experiments demonstrated that a frozen salt
layer can be formed and maintained at fluid flow
and heat transfer conditions approximately those
expected for processing fuel from a 1000 Mw
(electrical) MSBR.

27. Distillation of MSRE Fuel Carrier Salt

The nonradioactive phase of the MSRE distillation
experiment was completed, and equipment is being
installed at the MSRE for distillation of a 48-liter
batch of irradiated fuel salt. The nonradioactive
phase of the experiment involved distilling six
48-liter batches of MSRE fuel carrier salt; four of
the batches contained 0.1 to 0.3 mole % NdF ,.
Distillation rates for still pot temperatures in the
range 950 to 1025°C varied from 0.66 to 1.95
ft> of salt per day per square foot of vaporization
surface; these rates are acceptable for use of
distillation as a process step. Samples taken
during the runs showed entrainment and concentra-
tion polarization to be negligible. Post-operational
inspection showed the still to be in good condition.

28. Relative VYolatility Measurements
by the Transpiration Method

Liquid-vapor equilibrium data have been obtained
for several LiF-BeF2~ThF4 systems over the tem-
perature range of 950 to 1050°C. These data show
that the volatility of ThF4 is low and, consequently,
that distillation probably cannot be used as a
primary separation method in the processing of
single-fluid MSR fuels.

29. Preparation of 7LiF-233UF4
Concentrate for the MSRE

Thirty-nine kilograms of 7LiF-”sUF4 (73-27
mole %) eutectic salt was prepared to refuel the
MSRE. Cell G of the Thorium-Uranium Recycle
Facility was used to provide shielding for the
radiation associated with the 232U in the feed
material. A shakedown run using the intended
one-step high-temperature process revealed
several operational difficulties which prompted
modification of the process to a two-step low-
temperature procedure. The revised process
performed well, and the concentrate was

prepared in three batches, which met all the required
specifications. The product is now packaged in
capsules and cans ready for insertion into the
reactor.

30. Development of the Two-Step Process
for Preparation of 7LiF-233UF4 Fuel
Concentrate for the MSRE

The two-step process for preparation of the
"LiF-?°°UF, eutectic salt differed from the one-
step high-temperature process in that 'LiF was
added after the UF , had been prepared. The
procedure consists of the reduction of UO, to
UO, by hydrogen at 400 to 600°C, conversion of
Uo, to UF, with gaseous HF-H, at 400 to 650°C,
cooling down to add ’LiF, and reheating to melt
(~842°C). Traces of oxide contamination were
removed by treatment with HF-H, at 700°C.
Metallic impurities were reduced with hydrogen
and collected on a filter during salt transfer.
Laboratory tests with this procedure predicted
successful operation during the actual production.

31. Process Development on the Recovery

of Uranium from MSRE

Last-minute tests with the facility to recover the
uranium from MSRE fuel salt raised several ques-
tions which required additional experimental work.
The most significant were the corrosion rate during
fluorination and the associated corrosion product
contamination, the suitability of the sodium fluoride
packing for the sorption beds, the behavior of the
high-temperature sodium fluoride trap that precedes
the sorption beds, and finally the behavior of the
fluoride disposal system. Laboratory work was
performed in each area of concern. Studies with
the MSRE salt showed a stability of UF _ that
allayed fears of excessive corrosion. Comparison
of alternative packings led to the recommendation
of a high-surface-area material. It was recom-
mended that fluorine be deliberately added to the
gas stream leaving the fluorinator to avoid expos-
ing the high-temperature trap to pure UF , which
would have caused a uranium loss at this point.
An aqueous solution of KOH—KI-K28407 was
recommended for use in the fluorine disposal
system in the processing plant.

Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment

P. N. Haubenreich

The six-month period reported here saw the con-
clusion of operations with ?3°U and final prepara-
tions for the substitution of 233U in the fuel salt.
Nuclear operation of the reactor ended a few weeks
after the beginning of the period, following a very
successful six-month run. After testing and modifi-

cation the chemical processing equipment, which is
an integral part of the facility, was used to fluori-
nate the uranium out of the salt.

Part 1 of this report describes the experience with
the reactor and chemical plant and closely related
development work.

1.1 CHRONOLOGICAL ACCOUNT OF
OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE

J. L. Crowley A. I. Krakoviak
R. H. Guymon R. B. Lindauer
P. H. Harley M. Richardson
T. L. Hudson B. H. Webster

At the beginning of the report period, the reactor
was operating and had been for over five months.
An extended shutdown was scheduled to begin on
March 26. Removal of core specimens, inspection,
and some necessary maintenance were to be done
early; later the salt was to be processed to remove
the uranium so that 233U could be substituted for
the enriched 235U used originally.

The final weeks of nuclear operation were busy
with tests that defined the characteristics of the
system as it reached the end of operation with 235U
fuel. For the first week in March the reactor was
operated at reduced power (5 Mw) and various tem-
peratures and pressures to measure xenon poisoning
for comparison with observations made earlier in the

run. ! Then it was held at 10 kw for three days to
permit a reactivity measurement with practically no
xenon in the reactor. Finally the reactor was run at
the full power of 8 Mw for two weeks just before the
shutdown to build up the inventory of fission pro-
ducts whose distributions were to be studied soon
after the fuel was drained. The off-gas sampler was
used to trap a sample for xenon isotopic analysis,
and thermal conductivity measurements of off-gas
contaminants were made for the first time. Several
dynamics experiments were also conducted, some to
try new methods of investigation, others for com-
parison with the reactor characteristics observed
two years earlier. Power operation was concluded
with a rod and load scram on March 25. After a delay
to allow afterheat to diminish, the fuel was drained
on March 26.

The shutdown came more than six months after the
reactor first went critical in run 14. During that

lMSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Feb. 29, 1968,
ORNL-4254, pp. 4—6.
period the reactor was critical 4423 hr (98% of the
time). The only interruption of any significance
had been a week in November when the sampler-en-
richer wiring was being repaired.? It was not nec-
essary to drain the fuel then, but for two days fuel
circulation was stopped and the reactor was sub-
critical. Statistics at the end of run 14 and the end
of operation with 235U are listed in Table 1.1.

On March 11, two weeks before the end of power
operation, the fuel sampler-enricher malfunctioned.
During an attempt to take a 10-g sample of the fuel
salt, the latch apparently hung up, and over 17 ft of
drive cable was unreeled into the small isolation
chamber, where it became tangled. Efforts to reel
it back up were unsuccessful, and no more samples
were taken in the remaining 15 days of fuel circu-
lation. After the fuel was drained on March 26, the
isolation chamber was opened and the cable was
untangled. In the manipulations, the capsule came
unlatched and was dropped into the tube, with the
magnetic cap downward. After two different magnets
were lowered into the cage in the pump bowl in vain
attempts to retrieve the capsule, the system was

filled with flush salt. In the 19 hr that this salt
was circulated, an attempt was made to take a

50-g sample, but the long capsule was not fully
submerged. A 10-g sample was taken successfully.
Construction was started immediately on a mockup
of the sampler tube, latch stop, cage, and baffle
to be used in developing tools and planning efforts
to retrieve the capsule.

An outline of the activities during the shutdown
period is given in Fig. 1.1.

2MSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Feb. 29, 1968,
ORNL-4254, pp. 2, 12.

The first two weeks were tightly scheduled with
activities involved in different ways with the study
of the fission product distribution. As soon as the
fuel was drained the reactor cell roof was opened
and equipment was set up to measure the gamma-ray
spectrum from various sites on the fuel system.
Readings were obtained on the fuel heat exchanger
before, during, and after flush salt circulation. Two
defective heater units were removed from around the
heat exchanger while the maintenance shield was
set up at that point. The graphite and metal speci-
mens were then removed from the core for disassembly
and study. A removable section of the fuel off-gas
line was taken out for analysis of the material that
had accumulated in it. A flexible tool was used to
clear out the line back into the pump bowl, where a
restriction had been perceptible at times during run
14. A new section of off-gas line, equipped with
thermocouples, was then installed. The heater
units, which meanwhile had been repaired, were
reinstalled on the heat exchanger. Interspersed
with these jobs in the reactor cell was more gamma
spectrometry at sites selected from gamma-ray source
photographs made with a pinhole camera. By this
time the core specimen array had been reassembled
with some new specimens, and it was reinstalled in
the core.

Meanwhile, in the chemical processing facility
adjacent to the fuel drain tank cell, preparations
had been started for the processing of the flush and
fuel salts. The salt transfer line was cut, and the
new 9-ft? filter, designed to remove corrosion-pro-
duct solids from the fluorinated salt before its reuse
in the reactor, was installed. The system for adding
fluorine and disposing of the excess by reaction
with SO gas was tried briefly a week after the

reactor shutdown. There were deficiencies in the
flow control systems, and some unreacted fluorine
passed from the fluorine-SO, reactor, through the
bed of activated alumina backing it up, and attacked
the charcoal trap in the off-gas line. In the next
month the flow control was improved, and the alumina
trap was reloaded and provided with heaters to in-
crease its capacity. But a test early in May showed
there was still incomplete reaction of the fluorine
and SO,. Heaters and a temperature control system
were installed to improve the gas preheating and

the temperature control in the reactor. The steam-
water coil on the reactor had been damaged by high

temperatures in the first run, and this section of the
reactor was replaced. Another test on May 20-21
again showed a temperature rise in the backup alu-
mina bed; this was taken to mean fluorine was still
getting through the fluorine-SO , reactor. In the
meantime, laboratory tests had verified that it should
be practical to react fluorine with a caustic solution
in the scrubber tank just downstream of the absorb-
ers that remove UF  from the gas stream. Attention
then turned to this method of disposal of fluorine.
Tests in the mockup of the fuel sampler had by
now shown that a permanent magnet should be ca-
pable of retrieving the sample capsules, both the
one dropped in run 14 and the one dropped in August
1967. Two weeks of intensive efforts at retrieval
resulted only in recovery of the corroded cap of the
first capsule and the conclusion that the capsules
had been worked into a certain position whence
they could not be retrieved with a magnet. Tests
of dislodging tools in the mockup followed. Re-
sults were too disappointing, however, for an
attempt in the pump bowl, where fission product
contamination would make dislodging efforts ex-
pensive and time-consuming.

A preliminary test of the caustic solution method
of fluorine disposal in the chemical plant showed
that fluorine could indeed be disposed of very effi-
ciently at the required rates. Therefore the fluorine-
SO, reaction system was removed, and the permanent
repiping necessary to put the alumina trap down-
stream of the caustic scrubber was done. This
work was finished by early July. A test showed
good fluorine reaction, but an aerosol of molybdenum
oxides from the caustic scrubber plugged the line to
the alumina trap. Final major modifications of the
chemical plant then consisted of enlarging the
scrubber off-gas line and installing a large filter.

The first step in the actual processing of the salt
came on August 1 when the flush salt was trans-
ferred into the storage tank. Fluorination to remove
the 6 kg of uranium in the flush salt went very
quickly. Corrosion-product fluorides produced during
the fluorination were converted to filterable metal-
lic particles by treatment with hydrogen gas and
finely divided zirconium. On August 11, this job
was finished, and the flush salt was passed through
the new salt filter to the reactor drain tank, where
samples showed that the process had been quite
effective.

Meanwhile the salt circulating systems had been
heated, and as soon as the flush salt was available,
the fuel loop was filled and circulation started.
(The coolant loop was also filled, and coolant cir-
culation continued through the end of the report
period.) Circulation of the flush salt was for the
usual purpose of removing traces of moisture that
might have gotten into the reactor during the removal
of the core specimens and work on the off-gas line.
It also permitted a test of the sampler-enricher. A
10-g sample was obtained without difficulty, but a
long 50-g capsule was only half submerged, stopped
by an obstruction (presumably the wire on the lost
capsule) in the sampler cage. Two 25-g samples
were obtained, leading to the conclusion that the
obstruction would not prevent sampling and moni-

toring the fuel salt during subsequent reactor op-
eration.

The fuel salt was transferred into the storage tank
on August 18. Three days were spent in obtaining
samples defining the salt conditions at the end of
235y operation. (The sampler-enricher malfunction
had prevented these from being taken on the last
days of nuclear operation.) On August 23 fluori-
nation of the fuel charge was started, and six days
later the 219 kg of uranium had been loaded onto 28
absorbers filled with sodium fluoride pellets. No
difficulty was encountered in the process, and ex-
cellent recovery and decontamination were achieved.
Another ten days and the corrosion products had
been reduced and filtered out, leaving the stripped
fuel carrier salt in the reactor drain tank ready for
the addition of 233U.

1.2 CHEMICAL PROCESSING

R. B. Lindauer

1.2.1 Operating Summary

Portions of the MSRE salt processing facility
were tested in the course of the hydrofluorination of
the flush salt in May 1965, 3 but the fluorine supply
and disposal equipment had never been operated
before this report period. Highly efficient disposal
of the fluorine within the system was essential to
prevent unreacted fluorine from causing release of
radioiodine from the charcoal traps in the process
off-gas line. Therefore, shortly after the reactor
shutdown, testing and shakedown of the fluorine
systems were started to verify that they met the
requirements.,

The original design of the processing facility*
involved reacting fluorine with sulfur dioxide gas
at temperatures above 400°F to form sulfuryl fluoride,
SO,F ,, a relatively inert gas that could be dis-
charged to the atmosphere. Later a heated bed of
activated alumina was provided downstream of the
SO2-F‘2 reactor to remove traces of fluorine during
normal operation and to protect the charcoal traps

in case of a malfunction of the reactor. Between

Part VII — Fuel Handling and Processing Plant, ORNL-
TM-907 (May 1965).
April 5 and May 21 four test runs were made on this
system. Despite various modifications and improve-
ments, in each run there was some temperature
increase in the alumina bed, implying that some
fluorine was reaching it. Later it was shown that
decomposition of SO F, at temperatures above
800°F was probably the cause of the temperature
rise in the later tests. However, since it had not
been possible to demonstrate complete reaction of
the fluorine with the SO -F , scheme, the decision
was made to adopt the alternative of reacting the
fluorine with a caustic solution.

Results of laboratory experiments (described in
Chap. 31) and a brief test in the MSRE caustic
scrubber tank showed that a solution of 2 M KOH +
0.33 M KI very efficiently removed fluorine from a
helium-fluorine stream. After the necessary mod-
ifications were made in the processing facility to
eliminate the SO ,F , reaction equipment, an ex-
tended test of the fluorine disposal in the caustic
solution was made. This test showed that a filter
was needed downstream of the caustic scrubber to
handle molybdenum oxides entrained in the off-gas.
(The oxides were produced in the caustic solution
from corrosion-product MoF , coming from the
storage tank.) A larger off-gas line to a high-area
glass-fiber filter was then installed. At the same
time, dual inlet-gas dip tubes were installed in the
scrubber tank because occasional temporary plugging
was expected on the basis of laboratory test runs.

The flowsheet used in the salt processing is
shown as Fig. 1.2. The final modification before
salt processing began was to provide means to pre-
heat the NaF absorbers to 250°F to increase the
rate of UF  absorption. (The maximum temperature
could be limited to 400°F by air cooling.) The
flush salt was transferred into the storage tank on
August 1, and, after sampling, fluorination was
started on August 2 with the salt at 875°F. After
6.6 hr of sparging with fluorine, the uranium in the
flush salt was down to only 7 ppm (30 g of the
original 6 kg or so of uranium). Weight increases
in the NaF absorbers amounted to 9.6 kg, somewhat
more than expected, but within the scatter of the
UF . calculated from the initial uranium analyses of
the salt. The loading was rather spread out — weight
increases in the first three beds were 6.9 kg, 2.7 kg,
and about 0.2 kg. This was attributed to HF which
had gotten through the HF removal trap in the fluo-
rine addition system and had interfered with the
UF  loading,.

There were 2.3 kg of nickel, 0.9 kg of iron, and
0.6 kg of chromium as fluorides in the flush salt
after fluorination, mostly from corrosion of the
storage tank during fluorine-disposal testing and
flush-salt fluorination. These fluorides were re-
duced to the metals by treatment with hydrogen and
zirconium. Eleven hours of hydrogen sparging at
1225°F for NiF | reduction was followed by the
addition of 1.07 kg of zirconium and more hydrogen
sparging to reduce the FeF , and CrF,. The salt
was then filtered through a 9-ft ? filter of sintered
fibrous Inconel® as it was being returned to the re-
actor drain tank. Samples showed that the structural
metal concentrations were satisfactorily low after
this treatment.

Before the fuel salt was fluorinated, several
changes were made. The HF trap in the fluorine
supply was improved by substitution of high-surface-
area sodium fluoride pellets for the low-surface-area
material used previously. The low-surface-area NaF
in most of the UF _ absorbers was also replaced
with high-surface-area material. Some piping changes
were made in the absorber cubicle for more flexibil-
ity and convenience in changing absorbers. As an
added precaution against accidental criticality in
the caustic scrubber, the prescribed solution was
changed to include boron (0.2 M K B ,0.). Two
fission chambers were also installed to monitor
neutron multiplication. (The salt in the storage tank
was itself a strong neutron source.)

Fuel salt fluorination started on August 23. Flu-
orine was bubbled into the salt at 33 std liters/min
for 8 hr, converting the UF'4 to UF , before UF6
began to be evolved at a detectable rate. There-
after another 39 hr of fluorine sparging at lower
rates was required to bring the uranium content of
the salt down to 26 ppm. The fluorination extended
over a six-day period, as it was necessary to stop
five times to replace the UF , absorbers, the caustic
scrubber solution, and the fluorine supply trailers.
No significant difficulties were encountered during
this operation.

After fluorination the stripped fuel carrier salt
contained 4.0 kg Ni, 1.9 kg Fe, and 2.1 kg Cr as
the fluorides. These were reduced to the metals,
first by hydrogen sparging at 1230°F for a total of
52 hr, then by addition of a total of 5.0 kg of finely
divided zirconium followed by hydrogen and helium

sparging. After filtered samples showed that the
corrosion-product fluorides were satisfactorily low,
the salt was transferred through the large filter to
the fuel drain tank. When dip samples from the
drain tank showed that the reduction and filtration
had been successful, the salt processing was at an
end.

1.2.2 Data Analysis

Fluorination. — The 4280 kg of flush salt contained
about 6 kg of uranium before fluorination.® A flow
of 25 std liters/min of F diluted with a like amount
of helium was maintained for a total of 6.6 hr, at
which point fluorination was stopped because the
mass flowmeters at the entrance and exit of the
absorbers showed that UF _ evolution had practically
ceased. Samples of the salt taken after 5 hr of flu-
orination and at the end subsequently showed 24 ppm
of uranium and 7 ppm of uranium respectively (103
and 30 g of uranium). The overall fluorine utiliza-
tion from start to finish was 6.8%.

The fuel-salt charge contained an order of magni-
tude more uranium than the flush salt had: 219 kg
of uranium in 4730 kg of salt. Fluorination was

method indicated 5.7 kg of uranium in the flush salt.

nique indicated 6.6 kg of uranium. The discrepancy

started at a gas sparge rate of 33 std liters/min of
F ,. The fluorine utilization was very high at first,
but no appreciable UF , was evolved until after
practically all the UF , had been converted to UF ..
This occurred after 8 hr. When the inlet flowmeter
and the temperature in the first absorber showed
that UF . was coming off, the fluorine was reduced
to 24 std liters/min to limit the UF | flow for the
sake of more efficient absorption on the low-surface-
area NaF in the first absorber of the five-absorber
train. In later runs even lower fluorine flows were
used. Flow rates and fluorine utilization are listed
in Table 1.2 for each of the six runs. The rather
high utilization is probably attributable to the
depth of the salt — the fluorine and helium were in-
jected 64 in. below the surface through four 1/Q—in.
holes near the closed lower end of a 1-in. vertical
pipe. The variation of utilization with sparge rate
is evident from Table 1.2. The low utilization in
run 6 came as the uranium concentration was being
reduced to 26 ppm.

The fluorination of both the flush salt and the
fuel salt was carried out at 850 to 875°F, just
above the liquidus temperature of the salt.

Absorption of UF . — Thirty-one absorbers, each
loaded with about 50 1b of NaF pellets, were
available for UF absorption. Five absorbers were
connected in series for each run. Two quite differ-
ent types of NaF pellets were used: one with a sur-

face area per unit weight of 0.063 m?/g, the other

material.

All the beds used in the flush salt run contained
LSA NaF. Breakthrough of UF _ into the second and

third beds was observed, even though one bed should

have had more than enough capacity for all the UF
evolved. When the absorbers were removed and
weighed, the first, second, and third absorbers
showed weight gains of 6.9 kg, 2.7 kg, and about
0.2 kg respectively. The total gain, 9.8 kg, was
1.2 kg more than the weight of UF _ equivalent to
all the uranium in the flush salt as calculated from
the standard fluorimetric uranium analyses. How-
ever, the weight increase checks closely with the
uranium calculated from two samples analyzed by
neutron activation. Examination showed that some
HF had reached the absorbers and had reacted with
the NaF, probably accounting for the low loading
before breakthrough.

As a result of laboratory tests and the somewhat
questionable performance of the LSA Nak in the
flush salt run, most of the absorbers were reloaded
with HSA material. The available amount was in-
sufficient to change all the absorbers, however, so
some LSA absorbers were used during the fuel salt
runs.

Table 1.3 shows the amounts of uranium loaded on
each of the five absorbers during each of the six
runs. These weights were calculated from the
absorber weight gains, presumed to be UF .

Thermocoupes in the NaF beds near the inlet of
each absorber clearly showed when UF _ began to
be absorbed there. In run 1, the fluorine flow was
stopped when UF  reached the third absorber. Some
additional UF . was brought through as the gas space
in the storage tank was swept out with helium before
the absorbers were removed. Weights showed that
practically no uranium had reached the fourth ab-
sorber, so in the next run fluorine was not stopped
until a temperature rise showed in absorber 4. (The
fifth absorber was kept as a backup to ensure that
no substantial amount of UF . could get through to
the aqueous solution in the caustic scrubber.) In
the next three runs, in order to use more of the
capacity of the fourth absorber, fluorination was
continued for 60, 75, and 95 min after the initial
temperature rise in those beds.

Analysis of the caustic solutions removed from
the scrubber tank showed 4.2 g of uranium during
the flush salt runs and <1 g of uranium during the
fuel salt runs. These amounts are consistent with
the UF , that should have gotten through due to the
finite vapor pressure of UF , over NaF.

The total amount of uranium, 218.0 kg, calculated
from the weight gains of the absorbers is 1.1 kg
less than the amount believed, on the basis of prior
physical inventories, to be in the fuel salt charge.
About 0.12 kg was left in the fuel salt. The re-
maining 1.0-kg difference is within the accuracy of
the weight determinations on the absorbers. The
loaded absorbers were stored in a spare cell in the

reactor building pending desorption of the UF _ and
a more precise determination of total uranium re-
covery.

A comparison of the performance of the LSA and
HSA NaF pellets is shown in Fig. 1.3. Three
absorbers containing each type of NaF were used in
the No. 1 and No. 2 positions. In every case higher
uranium loading was obtained at lower temperature.
The LSA NaF retained 13 to 14% more uranium than
the HSA NaF in spite of the higher temperatures at
which the LSA absorbers were operated.

Fission Product Behavior. — The decontamination
factor for the process is the ratio of fission product
activity per gram of uranium in the salt to the ac-
tivity per gram of recovered uranium. Factors were
determined by salt samples and the weighted aver-
age of NaF samples taken from the inlet of the first
absorber in each run. For gross gamma activity the
decontamination factor was 8.6 x 108; for gross
beta activity, 1.2 x 10°. This excellent decontam-
ination meant that in contrast with the fuel salt,
which was reading about 1800 r/hr at several feet,
the absorbers were reading only a few mr/hr and
could be handled directly. (The radiation level at
the surface of the first absorber in run 1 was 25
mr/hr, the second absorber in run 1 was 6 mr/hr,
and the rest were <2 mr/hr.)

A complete breakdown of the fission product
activity on the NaF was not obtained, but most of
the fission product gamma activity was °5Nb.
Cerium and iodine were also identified on the NaF.

No beta activity could be identified other than that
due to uranium daughter activity. About 90% (73 mc)
of the calculated amount of !3!I that should have
been in the reactor or fuel at the time of processing
was recovered in the caustic scrubber solution,
about 99% of this in the batch used during the first
run. This indicates that nearly all the 13!l had
remained with the fuel salt during reactor operation
and salt handling and had then come off at the start
of fluorination. Such tellurium as was in the fuel
salt should also have come off during fluorination.
However, as expected, none was found in the scrub-
ber solution. There was no increase in radiation
from the charcoal absorbers to indicate that any
fission product had passed through the caustic
scrubber and had been absorbed on the charcoal.
Corrosion. — Quite high corrosion rates (0.5 to
1 mil/hr) were observed in the fluoride volatility
pilot plant process tank during fluorination runs.
Similar rates were anticipated in the MSRE pro-
cessing. However, to minimize corrosion the fluo-
rination was carried out at as low a temperature as
possible (850 to 875°F). Table 1.4 shows the ob-
served corrosion rates, calculated from the increase
in Ni, Fe, and Cr in the salt during fluorination.
The chromium rates may be slightly low because of
loss of chromium from the salt by volatilization at
the end of the runs when the UF _ concentration
was quite low.

Table 1.4. Corrosion Rates During Fluorination

Mils per Hour Based on —

Ni Fe Cr
Flush salt (6.7 hr) 0.1 0.18 0.15
Fuel salt (46.8 hr) 0.04 0.21 0.14

One factor in the relatively low corrosion rates
was probably the low temperature. (Most previous
experience had been at 1100 to 1300°F.) Another
is the fact that the fluorine was released at the
vertical center line of the 50-in.-diam tank of salt,
which would tend to reduce the fluorine concentra-
tion at the walls. On the other hand, the corrosion
products in the flush salt include those produced
during a 2-hr exposure of the empty tank to fluo-
rine at 1125°F before the salt processing.

The depth of corrosion for the entire campaign,
averaged over the tank surface, was 11 mils or less,
based on the amounts of iron.

Corrosion Product Fluoride Reduction and Filtra-
tion. — It was necessary to reduce the FeF , and

NiF , to the metals before returning the salts to the
reactor; otherwise they would attack the chromium
in the Hastelloy N. It was also highly desirable to
reduce the amount of chromium in the fuel salt so
that it could again serve as a sensitive indicator
of corrosion during reactor operation. Laboratory
tests had shown that the corrosion products could
be effectively removed by reduction of the fluorides
to the metals and filtration of the agglomerated
metallic particles. The NiF , could be reduced by
hydrogen sparging at high temperature; finely di-
vided zirconium metal was prescribed to teduce the
FeF , and CrF ,. Filtration was to be accomplished
by a 9-ft? filter newly installed in the line between
the storage tank and the reactor drain tank system.
The filter medium was sintered fibrous Inconel with
59-u pores.

The overall effectiveness of the process is shown
by the results in Table 1.5, which lists corrosion-
product concentrations in dipped samples of salt
just after fluorination and after the reduction and
filtration. It would appear that the process was not
as effective for FeF and CtF, as for NiF ,. This
is reasonable since NiF ) is the most easily reduced.

While the flush salt was being treated, several
attempts to take filtered samples in evacuated cap-
sules with fusible seals were unsuccessful. As a
result no analysis was obtained after the initial
11-hr sparge with hydrogen at 1225°F. Proceeding
on the assumption that the NiF , had been reduced
by the hydrogen, we added 0.6 kg of zirconium
metal to reduce the FeF , and CrF,. (The zirconium
was added as slugs of partially compacted turnings,
dropped in through the storage-tank sampler.) After
9 hr of sparging with hydrogen following the zirco-
nium addition, a sample attempt was successful.

Results showed that the nickel was down by a factor
of 10, but the iron and chromium were not signifi-
cantly changed. Therefore another 0.5 kg of zirco-
nium was added, and the tank was sparged with
hydrogen for 16 hr. Another sample attempt was
unsuccessful, but since the chromium was not ex-
cessive in the previous sample, the flush salt was
transferred to the drain tank through the filter. Sub-
sequent samples gave the results shown in Table
1.5. There was little difference between samples
taken in filter capsules and in open buckets, indi-
cating that the corrosion products were either
dissolved fluorides or very finely divided metals.

Before the fuel salt was processed a new type of
capsule had been invented. It had two compartments
one above a filter element, the other below. Salt
flowed into the upper compartment when the capsule
was submerged. Then when the capsule was lifted,
cooling of the gas in the lower compartment pro-
duced a partial vacuum which pulled salt down
through the filter disk. With this type of capsule,
samples were obtained as needed during the fuel
salt treatment. Thus the progress of the reduction
could be followed, and the utilization of hydrogen
and zirconium could be computed.

The fuel salt was sparged with 10 to 30 std
liters/min of hydrogen and 5 to 10 std liters/min

of helium at 1230°F for 17 hr before the first sample.

Dip line plugging in the caustic scrubber prevented
continuous operation at the higher rates. After this
period the scrubber solution was replaced, which
eliminated the plugging difficulty. Inexplicably,
the nickel analysis of the filtered sample was higher
by almost a factor of 2 than in the dipped sample-at
the start. Therefore the hydrogen treatment was
continued for another 17 hr. When a sample showed
the nickel concentration down some but not enough,
.another 18 hr of hydrogen sparging was given. A
filtered sample then showed the nickel at 180 ppm,
down from 840 ppm at the start. The hydrogen
utilization computed from this reduction was 2.1%.
At this point 4.9 kg of zirconium turnings were
dropped into the tank, and the salt was hydrogen
sparged for 24 hr. A sample showed very low nickel
concentration and the iron and chromium content
greatly reduced. After that sample the salt was
sparged with helium for 18 hr, 0.1 kg of zirconium
(that had fallen off in the sampler on the first addi-
tion) was added, and the salt was sparged with
hydrogen for 8 hr. The salt was then cooled to
1050°F (to improve filter-element strength) and
transferred to the drain tank. Samples gave the re-

sults shown in Table 1.5. If the change in nickel,
iron, and chromium concentrations from just after
the hydrogen treatment to the end point is attributed
to reduction of the fluorides by zirconium, the zir-
conium utilization was 72%.

1.2.3 Equipment Performance

A great deal of effort was spent on improving the
performance of the fluorine reactor before this ap-
proach was abandoned. Once the salt processing
was actually started, the major equipment performed
well, although there were a few minor problems.

Fluorine Reactor. — The original fluorine disposal
system used a fluorine reactor design similar to
that used for routine fluorine disposal at the gaseous
diffusion facility at Portsmouth, Ohio. This in turn
was a scale-up of work done at ORGDP.’7 With low
fluorine concentrations (when the heat of reaction
is low) it was found necessary to improve the in-
sulation of the fluorine and sulfur doxide lines to
the reactor and to install additional heaters on the
reactor inlet in order to maintain the inlet section
above 400°F. Procedures were modified to prevent
overcooling by steam when the reaction rate is low.
Similarly, heaters were installed on the line be-
tween the reactor and backup alumina trap and on
the trap inlet to maintain the entire trap at 900°F.
With these modifications it is now believed that the
system probably would have been satisfactory if the
alumina trap had been operated below the SO K
decomposition temperature (about 800°F).

Absorber Cubicle Blower. — This blower failed
during the first fuel fluorination run, apparently due
to the rotor slipping on the shaft. Operation con-
tinued without it when induced flow to the proc-
essing cell proved adequate to keep the cubicle
pressure negative relative to the operating area.
(The cooling air required to keep the absorbers
below 350°F did not produce excessive pressure
drop in the line connecting the cubicle to the
processing cell.)

Fluorine Trailer Flow Switches. — These safety
switches shut off the fluorine supply in case of
unusually high flow. They often stuck and pre-
vented flow, especially during startup.

Caustic Scrubber Dip Lines. — Dual inlet lines
with valves were provided because plugging prob-

’C. W. Weber, Anal. Chem. 32, 387 (1960).
11

lems were anticipated from laboratory tests. Plug-
ging persisted throughout the fluorination, occurring
several times per hour, and required almost con-
stant attention. Plugging was cleared by switching
to the spare line for several minutes, then returning
to the original line. The plugging is believed to

be caused by the hydrated oxides of nickel, iron,
and chromium from corrosion of the Inconel dip
tubes forming a dry deposit in the gas line, which
dissolved when gas flow was stopped.

Hastings Mass Flowmeters. — These meters, in-
stalled at the inlet and outlet of the UF  absorber
train, indicate the product of the mass flow rate
and the heat capacity of the gas stream. They are
quite sensitive to the appearance of UF _, which has
five times the heat capacity of fluorine.

The inlet meter provided a very sharp indication
of the start of volatilization of UF [ in each run.
The outlet meter, which would have revealed a
UF . breakthrough if it had occurred, in general
(except for run 2) gave anomalously high readings.
This could have been due to MoF .

The differences between the inlet and outlet
flowmeter readings, taken in conjuction with meas-

6’

ured inputs of fluorine and helium, were used to
calculate rates and amounts of UF6 volatilized and
F utilized. Figure 1.4 shows the differential
readings. As a check, the difference between the
inlet and outlet meters was integrated to get the
total amount of uranium volatilized in the six runs.
The result was within 5% of the amount determined
by weighing the absorbers. The fluorine utiliza-
tion during the initial period of conversion of UF,
to UF _ (run 1A) was calculated during two periods
of relatively steady operation to be 69% and 63%.
This agrees very well with the average of 65.8%
calculated from the fluorine input before the start
of UF evolution (see Table 1.2). The maxima in
the UF6 flow rates shown in Fig. 1.4 were used to
compute the maximum utilizations listed in Table
1.1. The maximum utilization was not computed
for run 1B because the fluorine flow rate was not
held constant long enough for the absorber inlet
gas to come to equilibrium. As can be seen from
run 5, at least 8 hr of steady operation is required
for the UF _ concentration to reach a maximum.
Therefore the figures reported for maximum utiliza-
tion all tend to be somewhat low.

1.3 REACTOR OPERATIONS ANALYSIS

1.3.1 Long-Term Variations in Reactivity

J. R. Engel B. E. Prince

During the final six-month period of power opera-
tion with 235U fuel (run 14) we measured the
zero-power reactivity balance five times, at inter-
vals of 4000 to 9000 Mwhr. These measurements,
over a period of substantial fuel burnup without
fuel additions or dilutions, permitted a clear com-
parison between the observed and predicted re-
activity behavior. The data showed a very small
but significant negative trend in the residual term
in the reactivity balance.® (The ‘‘residual re-
activity’’ is essentially the observed reactivity
minus that predicted.)® Although this trend did not
agree with the apparent absence of significant net
change over the entire period of operation up to
run 14, it was not clearly inconsistent with earlier
experience during any single run. Furthermore,
during run 14 the uranium concentration observed
in the fuel salt samples appeared to decrease
faster than the calculated burnup.!® Since both
trends were in the same direction, we undertook a
detailed, comprehensive review of the reactivity
balance calculation. This review led to some re-
finements and correction of some errors that sig-
nificantly altered the overall picture.

One very important correction was in the inte-
grated power, which affects many of the calculated
terms in the reactivity balance. While the review
of the reactivity balance was in progress, new
measurements of salt heat capacity showed that
the MSRE power was actually 11% higher than had
been computed from heat balances (see Sects. 1.4.1
and 9.3 of this report).

The most significant changes were made in the
term that describes the long-term isotopic changes
in the core. This term was originally intended to
describe only the reactivity effects of nonsaturating
and slowly saturating fission products. However,
in developing the balance equations it became

apparent that a number of other isotopic changes
in the core would have significant reactivity
effects. Since the time dependence of these
effects was similar to that of the fission products,
it was convenient to group all of them in one
term of the reactivity balance. Thus the isotopic-
change term includes, in addition to the fission
products, the effects of changes in the concentra-
tions of °Li, 234y, 236y, 238y, 239Py, 240Py,
and !1°B. Except for boron, which was present in
small amounts in the core graphite, all of these
isotopic changes occur in the fuel salt.
Evaluation of the reactivity effects of the long-
term isotopic changes would be relatively straight-
forward if all the various chemical species were
physically and chemically stable. In that case,
it would be valid to assume that all the original
species and their reaction products remain in the
medium (graphite or fuel salt) in which they are
formed. The reactivity effect of the changes
mentioned above was calculated under this assump-
tion to provide a basis for consideration of other
modes of behavior. Figure 1.5 shows the major
individual components as well as the net change,

as a function of integrated power. The most im-
portant terms are the buildup of ?3°Pu and non-
saturating fission products. Although these terms
have opposite signs and almost cancel each other,
the net reactivity change is positive because of
burnout of other species that act as neutron
poisons.!! We believe there is little uncertainty
or error in the reactivity effects of all the com-
ponents shown in Fig. 1.5 with one exception:

the nonsaturating fission products.

The assumption that the reaction products and
their daughters remain in the parent medium is not
valid for all the products of uranium fission.

Many of the decay chains include noble gases
(xenon and krypton) with substantial half-lives.
Since these gases are largely insoluble in the
fluoride salt melt, they tend to escape into the
off-gas system. In addition, there is evidence
that significant fractions of some noble metals
(notably Mo, Te, Ru, Tc, and Nb) are also removed
by the off-gas system, either as volatile fluorides
or as colloidal metallic particles.!? Another
mechanism for loss of poisoning, which occurs to
some extent, is the plateout of fission products on
surfaces outside the core region (see Sect. 2.2).

'10n the scale shown in Fig. 1.5, the reactivity
effects due to burnout of U and the associated
production of 235U are negligible and, therefore, are
not shown. They are included in the net result,
however.

A factor that enhances the poisoning effect of
some fission products is the diffusion of some
volatile species into the pores of the graphite. It
is clear from the above that very detailed informa-
tion about the behavior of all the fission products
would be required for an absolutely rigorous
description of their poisoning effect in the MSRE.
This information is not currently available.

To obtain some indication of the effect of
fission product loss on the net poisoning, we made
calculations for two idealized cases. These as-
sumed, in one case, removal of 100% of the noble
gases and, in the other case, concurrent removal
of both the noble gases and the noble metals.
(The only members of the latter category that are
significant neutron poisons are molybdenum,
ruthenium, and tellurium.) Figure 1.6 shows the
net fission product reactivity effect for the two
extreme cases along with the case for full re-
tention of all fission products. The largest change
results from removal of the noble gases and their
daughters. (The direct poisoning by 135Xe is
treated separately in the reactivity balance and
is, therefore, not included in this analysis.)

In the absence of quantitative information on the
behavior of all the fission products, we assumed
for the reactivity balance calculation removal of
all the noble gases and none of the noble metals.
Figure 1.7 shows, as a function of integrated
power, the residual reactivity that was obtained;
the straight line is a least-squares fit of all the
data. These data indicate that there was a small
positive trend in zero-power residual reactivity
throughout the 235U operation.

Uncertainties in the calculation of the long-term
effects and the difference between assumed and
actual fission product behavior both influence the
magnitude of this trend but are not large enough

to change its direction. A detailed sensitivity
analysis of the calculational model was made by
varying important input parameters by 5% from
the values used. (The most important parameters
are cross sections and effective fluxes and flux
ratios in the core.) This analysis indicated an
overall uncertainty in the long-term isotopic
changes of +0.05% &k/k at 70,000 Mwhr. The
uncertainty associated with the assumption of
fission product behavior is also about £0.05%
o0k/k (see Fig. 1.6). Thus the residual reactivity
at the end of the 235U operation was probably
between +0.08 and +0.28% &6k/k.

The review of the reactivity balance calculation
is not quite complete. There is one reactivity
effect that is known to exist, but it is quite diffi-

cult to calculate and heretofore has been neglected.

That is the effect of graphite distortion, discussed
in the next section.

1.3.2 Reactivity Effects of Radiation
Damage to Graphite

C. H. Gabbard

During the operation of the MSRE with 233U
fuel, there was a gradual upward drift in the re-
activity balance. One possible cause of this in-
crease could be the effects of the graphite shrink-
age and expansion which occurred due to radiation
damage. Small changes in graphite and salt
density distributions result both from direct ex-
pansion or contraction of the graphite and from

bowing and displacements of the graphite stringers.

A computer program was written to calculate the
radiation-induced changes in graphite and salt
densities as a function of core location, using the
calculated fast-neutron flux distribution in the core
and the known variation of CGB graphite dimen-
sions with neutron fluence. This permits the
graphite and salt density changes to be calculated
at various values of integrated power and con-
verted to reactivity changes for comparison with
the observed reactivity drift. The program had
just become operative at the end of the report
period and was being checked for errors.

1.3.3 Dynamics Tests at the End of
235 Operation

R. C. Steffy

Near the end of operation with the 235U fuel
loading, dynamic tests were performed on the
MSRE to reevaluate the frequency response of the
system. Results of these tests permitted a com-
parison of the dynamic response of the MSRE after
more than 70,000 Mwhr with that observed in the
initial experiments at power. Portions of the
tests also tried a new test signal and a different
testing method on a well-known system.

In the earlier testing programs, a control rod
was moved to vary the reactivity in a predetermined
test pattern. Test patterns included step reactivity
inputs and reactivity inputs following a pseudo-
random binary sequence (PRBS). (The latter is
referred to as a rod-jog test.) The tests at the
end of operation with 235U repeated the step
tests at 5 and 8 Mw, and a 127-bit rod-jog test
was repeated at 8 Mw. These provided a means
of direct comparison with the earlier tests. The
results of each of these tests at the end of 23°U
operation are in excellent agreement, in both
magnitude and shape, with the results obtained
during the initial power tests. Thus they show
that there has been no change in the dynamic be-
havior of the MSRE after more than 70,000 Mwhr
of nuclear operation. Results of the initial power
tests are shown in refs. 13 and 14, and results of
the tests performed at the end of 235U operation
are shown in Figs. 1.8, 1.9, and 1.10 of this re-
port. Not all of the tests in the two series were
performed at exactly the same power levels. How-
ever, the full-power tests were at the same power
level. This was identified earlier as 7.5 Mw, but,
since the correction of the power calibration, the
accepted value is 8 Mw.

The implementation of a pseudorandom reactivity
input requires exact control rod positioning and
repeatability. Since there was a question as to
the capability of the well-used control rod mech-
anism to satisfy these stringent requirements, we
tried imposing the signal shape on the flux in-
stead of the control rod position. This was ac-
complished by putting a false signal into the
control-rod-servo ‘‘flux-demand’’ instrumentation.
The servo interprets this signal as a need for rod
movement and moves the rod to match the input
from the neutron instrumentation with the false in-
put flux demand. By manipulation of the flux-
demand signal, the flux can be forced to approxi-
mate any reasonable test signal.

The new test signal which we desired to use
was the pseudorandom ternary sequence (PRTS).
The PRTS is a special series of positive, nega-
tive, and zero pulses (bits) chosen so that the
autocorrelation function of the test signal approxi-
mates the autocorrelation function of white noise.
The PRTS is of interest as a tool for frequency-
response testing because it has a flat power
spectrum over a wide frequency range which gives
information over a wide frequency band with only
one test. It is similar to the PRBS in this respect
but has the additional advantage of a zero average
value. Detailed descriptions of the PRTS may be
found in refs. 15 and 16. To our knowledge this
is the first time this test signal has been em-
ployed as a tool in experimental frequency-
response measurements. For similar tests there
was no apparent difference between results ob-
tained using the PRBS and PRTS testing signal.

Results of the various frequency-response tests
performed at the end of power operation with 235U
are shown in Figs. 1.8, 1.9, and 1.10. All of the
results of pseudorandom tests shown in these
figures were obtained using the flux-demand
technique unless otherwise noted. In general, the
frequency-response results are in good agreement
with the theoretical curves. The shape of all the
observed curves is as predicted. However, the
magnitude ratio of the data taken using the flux-
demand technique is higher than both the cor-

responding theoretical curves and the experi-
mental results from the earlier testing programs.
We believe this to be a result of hardware limita-
tions which were emphasized by the change in
testing technique. The control rods are required
to behave quite differently for the two types of
tests. During the rod-jog tests the rod is moved,
held constant for a number of seconds, then moved
to a new position, whereas the new method (flux-
demand) requires almost constant rod movement.
Discrepancy between actual rod position and
indicated rod position may be the reason for the
apparent shift in magnitude ratio.

The terms ‘‘direct analysis’’ and ‘‘indirect
analysis’’ shown on the figures indicate the type
of mathematical treatment performed on the data.
As used in this text, the direct method involves
generating the necessary power spectra directly,
whereas the indirect method first calculates the
necessary correlation functions and then converts
these to power spectra. The different types of
analyses yield essentially the same results when
applied to the same data, as shown in the figures.

From the results of the dynamic tests we con-
clude that the dynamic behavior of the MSRE has
remained essentially unchanged since the initial
approach to power. The reactor system is stable
at all power levels, with the degree of stability
increasing with increasing power level.

1.3.4 Correlation of Circulating Yoid Fraction
and Neutron Noise

D. N. Fry R. C. Kryter
J. C. Robinson

Operation of the MSRE has shown that a small
amount of undissolved helium cover gas circulates
with the fuel stream. Observed shifts in the re-
activity balance were used to calculate the changes
in void fraction with changing operating condi-
tions, but the absolute void fraction had eluded
measurement.!? Neutron noise analysis has now
been used in conjunction with an analytical model
of the system to infer a value for the void fraction.!®

18D. N. Fry, R. C. Kryter, and J. C. Robinson,
Measurement of Helium Void Fraction in the MSRE Fuel
Salt Using Neutron-Noise Analysis, ORNL-TM-2315
(in preparation).
According to the model, the neutron power
spectral density (NPSD) in the frequency range
from 0.5 to 2 hertz should vary as the square of
the helium void fraction in the fuel salt. During
the experiments with the MSRE in run 14, the
NPSD was found to be most sensitive to changes
in fuel temperature: the NPSD around 1 hertz
increased by a factor of almost 50 when the core
outlet temperature was lowered from 1225 to
1180°F.1° Over the same range the reactivity
balance showed that the void fraction increased
by 0.18% from some indeterminate minimum volume.
The minimum void fraction was inferred by fitting
the data on NPSD and changes in void fraction to
the relationship predicted by the model. A good
fit over the range of the data was obtained when a
very small value was assumed for the minimum
void fraction. It appears from this analysis that
the minimum void fraction was closer to zero than
to the 0.1-0.15% estimated previously.

1.3.5 Determination of Circulating Void
Fraction

J. C. Robinson D. N. Fry

From the analytical model of the system it was
possible to derive a theoretical pressure-to-flux
transfer function whose gain depended on the void
fraction in the fuel salt. The transfer function was
measured experimentally, and the void fraction
was calculated that would make the predicted
transfer function agree with that observed.

The fuel pressure was varied in a periodic
manner by flowing helium into the pump bowl at a
constant rate and opening a valve at regular
intervals to vent the helium to a drain tank being
held at low pressure. The resultant sawtooth
pressure perturbations had a maximum amplitude
of 0.3 psi and a period of 40 sec. The fuel pump
bowl pressure was about 5 psig, the core outlet
temperature was 1210°F, and the power was 8 Mw
during the test. The pressure signal and neutron
flux signal were amplified and simultaneously re-
corded on magnetic tape. A flux-to-pressure
transfer function was then obtained by three dif-
ferent procedures: (1) by the digital cross-cor-
relation procedure, (2) by the direct Fourier

19MSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Feb, 29, 1968,
ORNL-4254, p. 32.

19

transform procedure, and (3) by determining the
absolute auto-power spectral density (APSD) of
the pressure and neutron flux signals using a
calibrated analog spectral density analyzer.
Furthermore, the relative APSD’s of the two
signals were obtained using the digital program
normally used for the neutron noise data reduction
schemes on the on-line BR-340 computer. These
results are given in Fig. 1.11. This figure clearly
demonstrates the correlation in the neutron flux
signal to the pressure signal out to about the
sixth harmonic (frequency of 0.15 hertz).
Comparison of the experimental and theoretical
flux-to-pressure transfer functions indicated a void
fraction of 0.03% with an uncertainty of + 0.015%
and — 0.01%. (The uncertainties assigned are
due primarily to uncertainties in the model used
for the prediction of the theoretical transfer func-
tion.) For the conditions of the test, reactivity
balance measurements had indicated that the void
fraction was near its minimum value.

1.3.6 Neutron Flux near Reactor Vessel

R. C. Steffy

Before the MSRE was taken to power, nickel
and type 304 stainless steel wires were installed
in the reactor furnace adjacent to the vessel sur-
veillance specimens, about 5 in. from the vessel
wall, to serve as neutron flux monitors. The
isotopes which were used as monitors are listed
in Table 1.6 along with the reaction which occurs
when the isotope interacts with a neutron. The
high threshold energies for the (n,p) reactions
make it possible to determine the flux as a func-

tion of energy as well as axial position.

the furnace is somewhat different, the error in
average cross section is believed to be quite
small. The atom density was obtained from chemi-
cal analyses and densities of the samples. The
calculation was carried out using a computer
program which accounts for the detailed power
history of the reactor during the irradiation. Re-
sults are shown in Fig. 1.12.

Also shown in Fig. 1.12 are fluxes recently
calculated from low-power (1 kw) irradiation of
gold and copper foils.?! The data from this ir-
radiation were reevaluated using cross sections
for the MSRE spectrum instead of the cross sec-
tions used in the original calculation.

The position of the control rods affects the
axial profile of the neutron flux. The shim rods
are normally maintained at 44 in., with the regulat-
ing rod somewhat lower. As shown in Fig. 1.12,
the flux at all energies is significantly lower
above the level of the rods.

The peak thermal flux (E < 0.876 ev) in the re-
actor furnace is about 1 x 10! neutrons cm™?
sec™! Mw~! and occurs about 30 in. above the
bottom of the horizontal graphite bars. The peak
epithermal flux (E > 0.876 ev) is about 1.9 x 10!
neutrons cm~ 2 sec™! Mw~! and occurs at es-
sentially the same position. This gives a peak
total flux of 2.9 x 10!! neutrons cm~?2 sec™!
Mw~—!. The higher-energy fluxes, as determined
by (n,p) reactions with >8Ni and *Fe, peak at
essentially the same position.

1.3.7 Observation of Fission Products
After Shutdown

A. Houtzeel

The gamma radiation levels in the reactor cell
and drain-tank cell are indicated by six radiation
monitors, three in each cell. Readings are taken
routinely on each 8-hr shift. The source of the
radiation that affects the monitors is very com-
plex. This is particularly true in the reactor cell,
where a broad spectrum of fission products, some
in the salt and some deposited on surfaces, are
distributed around the piping system at various
distances and with various shielding from the
radiation detectors. Nevertheless, because of the

21MSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Feb. 28, 1966,

great interest in the fission product behavior in the
MSRE a study was launched to extract as much
useful information as possible from the in-cell
gamma radiation data. This study will supple-
ment the other observations of gamma-ray spectra
after shutdown and the activities in samples.

The operations at the end of run 14 and the long
shutdown that followed provided interesting data
to study. The readings from the three detectors in
the reactor cell and one in the drain-tank cell are
shown in Fig. 1.13 from March 14 to August 28,
1968.

Although the thorough analysis including
volumes, surface areas, distances, and shielding
of sources was not completed in this report period,
some noteworthy features were observed from the
plots in Fig. 1.13.

1. The sharp increase in activity in the drain-
tank cell near the end of the power run (March
20) was due to pressure-pulse experiments in
the reactor system; the reactor off-gas was
routed through one of the drain tanks and
drain-tank vent system instead of the normal
reactor off-gas system. This gives some
indication of the intensity of the off-gas
activity.

2. The decay of the radiation level in the reactor
cell was not strongly affected either by the
presence or absence of the fuel salt (drained
on March 25) or by the first flushing operation
(drained March 29). The flush salt itself ap-
parently provided some shielding while it was
in the fuel loop.

3. Especially during the first month after shut-
down the rate of decay was greater in the re-
actor cell than in the drain-tank cell. This
may indicate that some fission products with
intermediate half-lives remained in the fuel
or off-gas system rather than with the fuel
salt.

4. The second flush salt operation (August 16)
decreased the activity in the reactor cell
somewhat. Apparently some decay products
were washed out of the system.

5. The data from the drain-tank cell after early
August are probably not significant because
of the reprocessing operations that were in
progress. Both the flush and fuel salt were
transferred several times.

6. The reliability of these high-level radiation
monitors decreases substantially at radiation
levels below 40 to 50 r/hr.

1.3.8 Unscheduled Scrams During
235y Operation

P. N. Haubenreich

Operation with 235U spanned 34 months, from
May 1965 to March 1968, during which time fuel
salt was in the core a total of 13,487 hr. There
were 29 unscheduled rod scrams while fuel was
in the core, but not one was caused by a process
variable actually reaching a safety trip point.
(Some scrams occurred when the flux level safeties
were switched down to 15 kw while the reactor
was at higher power, but these are not counted
as power reaching a safety trip point.) A break-
down of the scrams by time and cause is given
in Table 1.7.

A considerable improvement with time is evident
from Table 1.7. The rash of six scrams attributed
to instrumentation and controls in the second
quarter of 1966 was due to several sources of
noise in the signals. Of the three scrams at-
tributed to ‘‘other’’ causes, one was caused by a
momentary voltage sag that tripped the safety
channels, one was a manual scram to investigate
a fire alarm (false), and one occurred when an
electrical short tripped a power breaker in the
reactor area. ‘‘Power failure’’ refers to an inter-
ruption of electrical power to the reactor area.

1.3.9 Thermal Cycle History

C. H. Gabbard

The accumulated thermal cycle history of the
various components sensitive to thermal cycle
damage is shown in Table 1.8. Approximately
73% of the design thermal cycle life of the fuel
system freeze flanges has been used to date.
This compares with a value of 69% at the end of
the previous report period and with 63% at the
beginning of run 14 a year ago.

1.4 EQUIPMENT

1.4.1 Heat Transfer

C. H. Gabbard

During the previous operation of the MSRE,
the heat balance power and the heat transfer
performance were calculated using a coolant-salt
specific heat that was temperature-dependent.
Analysis of the MSRE operating data strongly
suggested, however, that the specific heat was
actually a constant. This was confirmed by a
recent series of enthalpy measurements which
gave a specific heat of 0.577 Btu 1b—! °F)~!
which had been used for the average value over

1.4.2 Salt Samplers

R. B. Gallaher

Fuel Sampler-Enricher. — During the report
period the sampler-enricher was used for 12
sampling operations, bringing the total to 361
samples and 114 salt additions. The 12 opera-
tions successfully obtained four 10-g samples,
two 25-g samples, one 50-g sample, and two
samples in freeze-valve capsules. One attempt
to take a 10-g sample ended in the capsule being
dropped into the pump bowl. Twice later 50-g
€apsules were lowered into the pump bowl but
did not fill with salt.

On the sampling attempt that resulted in the
sampler cable becoming tangled, there was no
sign of trouble as the cable was unreeled the
usual 17 ft 5 in. As it was being rewound, the
motor stalled with 13 ft 5 in. off the reel. A few
attempts to unreel and rewind convinced us that
the cable was tangled in the isolation chamber
as it had been on previous occasions.?? To

22MSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Aug. 31, 1967,

minimize the chance of severely kinking the
cable, the drive motor was operated at reduced
voltage (50 to 80 v) to reduce its torque during
repeated attempts to untangle the cable by un-
reeling and rewinding. In the course of 76 at-
tempts, the drive stalled at various points as the
coils of cable were shifted, but in the end there
was no net gain.

The isolation valves were left open for the
next two weeks, but a slight purge of helium down
the tube kept fission products from diffusing back
up to the sampler.

When the access door was opened after the fuel
salt was drained, the capsule was visible through
the lower corner of the port opening, and the latch
could be seen in the back of the chamber. There
were many loops and coils of cable. Evidently
the capsule and latch had never left the isolation
chamber on its way down at the start of sampling.
The reason for the capsule hanging cannot be
ascertained; when the operator had closed the
door the capsule appeared to be hanging normally.

Some of the drive cable loops extended down
into the sampler tube, and rather than risk cutting
the cable, we left the isolation valves open. As
an attempt was made to lift the capsule out of the
isolation chamber, the manipulator fingers brushed
some of the coils, causing them to spring out
through the access port and pull the capsule
cable from the manipulator jaws. The capsule
dropped into the sampler tube, bottom up, the
latch tipped over, releasing the key, and the
capsule and key disappeared down the tube.

It proved possible to use the manipulator to
untangle the cable and pull it into the outer con-
tainment area (area 3A). Only one bad kink was
found, and it was straightened acceptably with the
manipulator.

Although it appeared that the capsule had fallen
with the magnetic top underneath, immediate at-
tempts were made to retrieve it using magnets
that were available. A ¥%-in.-diam, 1-in.-long
magnet was lowered into the pump bow! without
success. A 3/8 x 6 in. magnet was lowered but
came up clinging to the latch. A % x 5 in. magnet
with a copper tube around the cable to hold the
magnet off the latch was lowered but could not be
worked past the magnetic obstruction where the
sampler tube penetrated the wall of the reactor
cell.

After the loop was filled with flush salt, a 50-

g capsule was lowered into the pump bowl. It
came up empty, and salt droplets clinging to the
upper sides showed it had been only half sub-
merged, presumably because it had come to rest
on the dropped capsule inside the cage. A 10-g
capsule was submerged and collected a sample.

A full-size mockup of the sampler tube and the
pump bowl internals was constructed to test mag-
nets and other types of retrieval tools (Fig. 1.15).
Two capsules, one without cable and key and the
other with, were dropped in the mockup to simulate
the capsules lost in August 1967 and March 1968.
The most probable configuration of the capsules
is shown in Fig. 1.16. The simplest and most
effective retrieval tool proved to be an Alnico 5
permanent magnet. With 3/4-in. and 1/z-in. magnets,
recovery of both capsules was successful except
in the rare instances when the capsule cable be-
came knotted around the guide cage or the key
fell outside the mist shield. Although the second
capsule was upside down, it could be shifted into
a favorable position by dropping the magnet.

Because the actual recovery had to be attempted
blind, a speaker connected to the microphone on
the pump bowl was used to listen in on the grap-
pling. The 1/z-in. magnet was lowered into the
pump bowl, and sounds were heard indicating that
an object was being lifted a few inches and then

27

dropped. After scores of attempts, the magnet
came up with a lump attached which later proved
to be the corroded top of the old capsule. The
34‘-in. magnet was, after some difficulty with the
magnetic penetration, also lowered into the pump
bowl. There was never any indication that the
34‘-in. magnet picked up anything. Further mockup
work convinced us that the second capsule had
gotten outside the cage, where it could be reached
by the 1/2

Several types of dislodging tools were tried in
the mockup. Two tools proved capable of moving
the capsules. However, as often as not the cap-
sules were shifted so as to make retrieval more
difficult rather than easier. When the capsules
were already in a difficult position, the dislodging
tools were not effective. Therefore no attempt
was made to use these tools in the pump bowl.

When the fuel system was next filled with flush
salt in August, a 10-g sample was obtained, but
a 50-g capsule came up empty. It appeared to
have been submerged slightly over halfway. New
windows were cut in two 50-g capsules, and
samples containing 25 g of salt were obtained.

The capsules were stopped with the bottom 1%
in. above the bottom of the cage. The most likely
explanation appeared to be that the cable and key
from the second capsule were projecting back into
the cage. When the heavy magnet was dropped it
could brush past, but the sample capsules, partly
buoyed up by the salt, were stopped.

During the long shutdown a proximity switch,
actuated when magnetic material goes by, was
mounted on the sampler tube about 4 in. below the
lower isolation valve. The sampling procedure
stipulates that if the switch has not been activated
when the position indicator shows that sufficient
cable has been reeled out, the drive will be stopped
to prevent the cable from tangling badly in the
isolation chamber.

A control was added to the drive motor circuit
to allow operation at any desired voltage. Normal
operation was changed from 110 v to 80 v to
lessen chances of damaging the cable in case of
a kink.

The manipulator assembly was replaced be-
cause the tips of the fingers no longer closed
tightly. The old assembly was decontaminated
and repaired. The boots that went on with the
new manipulator were thinner than the old, permit-
ting freer movement. An excessive pressure dif-
ferential was accidentally applied in the first

-in. magnet but not by the 3/4-in.

operation, resulting in a hole in one boot. The
next replacement set were the original, thicker
boots.

Fuel Processing Sampler. — Installation and
check-out were finished during this report period,
and during the salt processing the sampler was

used 20 times. There were twelve 10-g capsules,
seven 50-g capsules, and one freeze-valve capsule.

A proximity switch and motor voltage control
were included in the final installation.

An unexpected difficulty arose during the first
few sampling operations. The drive stalled with
about 3 ft of cable still out, but after a few minutes
it rewound freely. Inspection of the cable showed
no abnormality. It was concluded that the problem
was a temperature effect on the drive. In this
sampler the cable extends well down into the
high-temperature region in the fuel storage tank.
There is no pause for freezing, as in the other
salt samplers, since the tube goes straight down.
We suspected that the length of hot cable caused
the drive gears to heat up and bind. A cooling
period added to the procedure alleviated the prob-
lem.

1.4.3 Control Rods and Drives

Malcolm Richardson

The control rods and drives operated in a
satisfactory manner throughout run 14. After the
shutdown in March, the No. 2 drive was removed
to replace the fine synchro position indicator,
which had failed in January. It was found that the
wiper leads were burned off at the slides. A limit
switch which began malfunctioning after the drive
was removed was also replaced. While the drive
was out, the No. 2 rod was pulled up and inspected
by omniscope. It appeared to be in excellent con-
dition. The No. 2 unit was then reassembled and
installed. The No. 1 and No. 3 units were not
disturbed.

1.4.4 Radiator Enclosure

Malcolm Richardson

No trouble with operation of either the inlet
or outlet door was encountered during this period.
Inspection of the doors after shutdown revealed
some additional minor warping. The links of the
segmented ‘‘hard-seal’’ surface had expanded,
closing the 1/32-ir1. expansion gaps in many places
and causing some rippling. All the links were in
place, but a short section of the ‘‘soft seal’’ on
the outlet side of the radiator face had been torn
loose and was replaced.
1.4.5 Off-Gas System

R. B. Gallaher A. L. Krakoviak

In the last weeks of run 14 the off-gas sampler
was used to trap another sample of the fuel off-
gas for xenon analysis,?? and the thermal con-
ductivity system was tried for the first time on
the actual process gas.

The system provides an indication of hydro-
carbon content by sending the stream through a
heated copper oxide bed which converts the hydro-
carbons to water and carbon dioxide, through one
side of a thermal conductivity cell, through an
absorber to take out the H,0 and CO,, then back
through the other side of the conductivity cell.
The difference in thermal conductivity is a meas-
ure of the hydrocarbon content. When the fuel
off-gas was sent through this route, the indication
was that there were more impurities in the helium
after the absorber than there were ahead of it.
The diagnosis was radiation decomposition of the
wet magnesium perchlorate absorber material.
Plans were made to change the absorber unit to
one containing dry molecular sieve, after tests of
this material showed no significant decomposi-
tion to 107 rads.

The other thermal conductivity cell compares
the conductivity of a reference stream of pure
helium with that of off-gas, which may have gone
through the hydrocarbon system or not. The read-
ing is a measure of the total contaminants at that
point. (Itis not unambiguous, because the con-
ductivity effect varies with the identity of the

contaminant.) When this system was first operated

with the hydrocarbon system bypassed and the re-
actor at full power, the indication was about 100
ppm of total contaminants in the helium. After
the power was lowered to 10 kw, the reading de-
creased to 52% of the full-power value. The fuel

salt was drained, and flush salt was added. Three

hours after flush-salt circulation started, the gas
contaminant reading was 16 times that at full
power. It dropped in the next 2.5 hr to 1.5 times
the full-power value and leveled out there for
several hours. After the flush salt was drained,
helium was circulated in the fuel loop at 5 psig,
with the normal 4 liters/min flow to the off-gas

23MSR Program Semiann., Progr, Rept. Feb. 29, 1968,
ORNI1.-4254, p. 19,

30

system. A contaminant level 100 times the full-
power value was observed. After the fuel system
was vented and repressurized, the reading was
still 50 times full power (about 0.5% impurities in
the gas). By this time the radiation level was
relatively low, so the hydrocarbon system was
valved in. The hydrocarbon indication was low
and the other reading changed little, implying that
the high reading was not due to hydrocarbons.
The inference was drawn that fission products
were coming off into the off-gas from the bared
surfaces in the fuel system.

The restriction in the off-gas line near the fuel
pump that had been detected earlier?? gave no
trouble in the last weeks of operation, but there
were indications that it was still there. Nine
days after the fuel was drained, the flexible sec-
tion of off-gas line was removed, and a flexible
tool was run through the 28 in. of line back to the
pump bowl. The tool, a % -in. cable with a diamond
drill tip, encountered some resistance at first and
came out with a considerable amount of solids on
it (see Chap. 17). The flexible jumper and the
line downstream did not appear to be restricted.
After the new jumper was in place, flow—pressure-
drop measurements showed no evidence of any
restriction.

The replacement jumper line was equipped with
four thermocouples to provide more information
during power operation. In addition a slender
basket was suspended in the entrance of the 4-
in. off-gas holdup pipe. In it were devices of
metal and graphite to collect material from the
off-gas stream for future study.

The small filter in the coolant off-gas line be-
came plugged in May and was replaced,

1.4.6 Main Blowers
C. H. Gabbard

The two main blowers, MB-1 and MB-3, con-
tinued to operate without difficulty throughout run
14 and have accumulated 7800 and 7125 hr of
operating time since they were rebuilt. Both
blowers were disassembled for their routine an-
nual inspection, and the rear bearings were re-
placed on the basis of the grease appearance.

29MsR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Feb. 29, 1968,
ORNL-4254, p. 13.
The thrust bearing of MB-3 was also replaced be-
cause of a heavy thumping noise accompanied by
a shaft displacement that occurred when the rotor
was turned by hand. The difficulty was found to be
a relatively large misalignment between the rotor
shaft and the outer race of the bearing. Other-
wise the bearing had been in good condition. The
bearing is mounted in a spherical self-aligning
mount, but the friction forces are apparently too
high for the mount to be effective. The MB-3
replacement bearing and the MB-1 bearing were
therefore aligned manually. In other respects,
both blowers were in good condition, and there
was no evidence of cracking in the hubs or blad-
ing.

1.4.7 Heaters

T. L. Hudson

By the end of run 14, heater units HX-1 and
HX-2 on the primary heat exchanger were in-
operative because of open leads. These two
units were removed from the reactor cell early in
the shutdown (on the fourth and fifth day after
the end of full-power operation) to see if repairs
were possible or if replacement units would be
required. The trouble was found in the junction
boxes mounted on top of the heaters, where the
lead wires from several of the heater elements
had burned in two at their screwed connections
to the terminal strips. Repair was complicated
by the induced activity in the assemblies, which
produced a gamma radiation field of about 3 r/hr
at 1 ft. A temporary work shield was set up hav-
ing concrete block walls and a top of steel plate
and lead block, with a small opening in the top
through which direct maintenance on the junction
box was feasible. The terminal strips and con-
nections were severely oxidized, apparently due
to high temperatures during operation. The situa-
tion was corrected by installing nickel terminal
strips and welding the heater leads directly to
them. The copper wire from the terminal strip to
the disconnect was also replaced with No. 12
nickel wire welded to the terminal strip. Aside
from the damage in the junction boxes, both HX-1
and HX-2 were in good condition, and after the
repairs both were reinstalled through the main-
tenance shield without unusual difficulty.

After the units were reinstalled in the cell it
was found that the current on one phase of HX-1

was zero. This proved to be due to a fault in the
permanently mounted lead wire in the cell. The
fault was circumvented by installing a jumper
cable between the HX-1 disconnect and a spare
disconnect. The heaters functioned satisfactorily
during the subsequent heatup of the system.

1.4.8 Oil Systems for Salt Pumps

A. 1. Krakoviak

Although the fuel and coolant salt pumps were
shut off and at ambient temperature during most
of this report period, the lubricating oil systems
for both salt pumps operated continuously and
without incident. The only problem was the re-
curring gradual fouling of the water side of the
cooling coils on the oil reservoir. Switching to
process water for a few weeks seems to clear the
coils to the extent that tower water again provides
adequate cooling.

As expected, there was no shaft seal oil leak-
age during shutdown; however, on startup of both
salt pumps in August, the shaft seal leakages re-
sumed at the same rates as those that had existed
before the March shutdown, namely 6 cc/day for
the fuel pump and 20 cc/day for the coolant pump.

Since previous analyses showed no significant
deterioration of the oil quality, the oil was not
changed during this shutdown.

1.4.9 Component Cooling System

P. H. Harley

Component cooling pump No. 2 (CCP-2) was in
service continuously for the last 3886 hr of run 14
after CCP-1 was shut down because of loss of oil
from its lubrication system. After run 14 the belt
on CCP-2 was found to be quite loose, worn, and
severely cracked. Belts and check-valve flappers
were replaced on both units.

Because of the history of oil leaks,?5 the
soldered copper tubing in the lubrication system
of both pumps was replaced with welded stainless
steel. After the threaded unions in the new sys-
tem were seal-welded, no more leakage was ob-

During the initial run-in of the new belts, ex-
cessive oil bypass and low air output were noted.
These were corrected by tightening the oil relief
valves and the air pressure relief valves. After
resumption of operation in August, both com-
ponent cooling pumps operated satisfactorily,
although CCP-2 oil pressure was slightly low.

While the blowers were down for maintenance,
the gates on the isolation valves were inspected
because excessive leakage had been experienced.
Several large pits were found in the gate of the
valve in the CCP-2 discharge line. The pits ap-
peared to have been casting defects that had
been repaired earlier with epoxy. Repairs were
made by laying down stainless steel with a metal-
lizing gun and remachining. The air leakage
through this valve was reduced from over 100
scf/day to 0.5 scf/day at a pressure differential
of 30 psi.

There was no detectable change in the pressure
drop across the strainer in the discharge of the

component cooling pumps during this report period.

1.4.10 Containment and Yentilation

P. H. Harley

During the final weeks of run 14, the reactor
cell inleakage (at — 2 psig) continued at about

32

17 scf/day, more than a factor of 4 below the ac-
ceptable maximum.

During the maintenance period a major portion
of the annual containment test was completed,
namely the testing of all containment valves.

Out of about 160 valves, only 11 had leak rates
that exceeded prescribed limits: 3 in the cover-
gas system, 4 in the water system, and 4 air or
nitrogen block valves. Dirt or debris on the seat
was the predominant cause of leakage. All valves
were satisfactory after servicing.

Release of the beta-gamma activity through the
stack amounted to 343 mc during the six-month
report period. Of this, 193 mc was released dur-
ing the week in which the off-gas line was open
in the reactor cell for reaming. Most of the re-
mainder was released during the three weeks that
followed, probably from material that escaped into
the cell during the reaming operation. The re-
lease of radioiodine during the report period was
quite negligible, amounting to less than 0.3 mc in
six months.

2.1 FREEZE-FLANGE THERMAL-CYCLE TESTS

F. E. Lynch

Operation of the freeze-flange thermal-cycle test
which had been resumed at 103 cycles® was con-
tinued through 268 cycles, at which point it was
shut down for inspection of the flanges and for
minor repairs. There was no indication during
the operation of any changes in the flanges. There
were, however, several minor operational problems
of interest. These, together with the results of
the inspection of the flange, are described below.

2.1.1 Facility Operation Problems

The accumulated downtime was due almost
entirely to shorted level probes. Fifteen shorts
occurred during the 165 cycles, and after each
one it was necessary to shut down to clean the
probe. Twelve of the fifteen shorts occurred
during the first 65 cycles. After a filament
transformer was placed in the probe circuit and
the level probe was connected to the secondary
side (6.3 v) of the transformer, there were only
three periods of difficulties with shorted probes
during the next 100 cycles.

As previously reported,’ helium was used as
the pressurizing gas to oscillate the salt after
it was found that with argon the desired upper
bore temperature could not be maintained. When
the building gas supply was changed to argon,

a helium bottle header was placed in the line and
the supply controlled through two timers and

1MSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Feb. 29, 1968,
ORNL-4254, pp. 23--28.

33

solenoid valves. We have found that by adjusting
the timers so that, during the oscillation period,
argon is supplied as a pressurizing gas for 10 min
and then helium is supplied for 2 min, the desired
operation temperatures could be maintained with
a reduction in the usage of bottle helium.

Upon disassembly of the flanges we found that
the thermocouples at the flange bore had failed
so as to indicate the temperature of the salt instead
of the metal surface. However, examination of
temperatures from thermocouples located on the
outside of the flanges gave confidence that the
flange had been subjected to the proper thermal
cycle. The bore thermocouples were replaced.

2.1.2 Inspection of the Flanges

When the flanges were disassembled, the oval
ring gasket with the stainless steel insert screen
was removed and inspected. The average diameter
of the frozen salt cake on the screen was 10 in. At
the end of the first 103 cycles, the diameter had
been 11 "/2 in. Higher flange temperatures accom-
panying some of the earlier tests would account
for the difference.

A dye-penetrant inspection of the inner flange
face and bore of both flanges was made. We found
that the female flange was intact and crack free
both in the bore and on the flange. The face of
the male flange was also crack free, but the dye
penetrant indicated a crack in the flange bore, as
shown in Fig. 2.1. The crack extended circum-
ferentially about 90 to 110° clockwise around the
bore starting from the top vertical center line.
Although not evident in Fig. 2.1, the penetrant
also indicated a band of porosity starting at the
crack and extending about 1/4 in. farther into the
bore. The porosity band followed the crack

through its 90 to 110° arc and also extended
counterclockwise through an additional 120 to
130° of arc. The crack was located at the base
of the 1 1/2-in. alignment stub directly opposite
the sharp corner (1/8 in. radius) at its juncture
with the inner face of the flange, as shown in
Fig. 2.2. Both the crack and the porosity are
probably within the heat-affected zone of the
weld that attaches the alignment stub.

The specific cause of the crack and porosity is
unknown. However, the flange is approaching its

predicted life of 300 cycles. The stresses are
relatively high in the flange bore, but at this
location they could be even higher because of

the bending moment produced by the alignment
stub. If the cracking is due to high local stresses
or the heat-affected zone of the weld, the service-
ability of the flange would be unimpaired, because
the alignment stub was provided only as an aid

to the remote assembly of the flange and a com-
plete failure of the stub would not affect the
integrity of the joint.
Reassembly of the flange was completed in
preparation for resumption of the test. Except
for more frequent inspection, the test procedure
will not be changed. The exterior of the flanges
will be inspected visually during and after each
cycle, and the inner flange faces and bores will
be examined at the end of each 50 cycles. The
test will be extended to determine the number of
thermal cycles a flange of this design can be
subjected to before failure.

2.2 GAMMA SPECTROMETRIC MEASUREMENTS
OF FISSION PRODUCT DEPOSITION

R. Blumberg T. H. Mauney

Shortly after the shutdown in March a series of
gamma-spectrometric measurements were made of
fission products that had deposited on the metal
surfaces in the fuel system. This work was an
extension, with improved equipment, of a similar
scan of the fuel heat exchanger in May 1967.2
The technique involved was developed to provide
an additional means of studying the behavior of
fission products in the MSRE. Other means include
the total gamma radiation in the reactor and drain
tank cells (see Sect. 1.3.7), samples of fuel salt
and cover gas,® specimens of metal and graphite
from the center of the core (Sect. 18.1), and
material from the fuel off-gas line (Sect. 17).

The measurements were made by combining
the laboratory technique of gamma spectroscopy
with the equipment and shielding developed for
maintenance of the highly radioactive MSRE com-
ponents. A lithium-drifted germanium diode detec-
tor, mounted in a highly collimated gamma beam,
was coupled to a 400-channel analyzer through
appropriate amplifiers. The detector-collimator
assembly was mounted on and shielded by the
portable maintenance shield, which also served
as a carriage to move the detector to various
positions over the reactor components. The
mechanical arrangement used is shown in Fig.
2.3. More details are given in Sect. 14.13.

The basic information obtained was a gamma-ray
spectrum, that is, a plot of the number of photons
detected vs the energy of each photon. Isotopes

are identified by the energy of their emitted gamma
rays. A typical spectrum is shown in Fig. 2.4,
The area under a peak, after correction for back-
ground, is proportional to the amount of the isotope
present. The following equation was used to
compute the curies of a radionuclide deposited

per square inch of metal surface, corrected to the
time of shutdown:

(CR)eM

curies

. (F)(B)(AB)(AF)(3.7 x 1019)

in.

where CR is the area under the peak expressed as
counts per second, ¢ is the decay time from reactor
shutdown to the measurement time, A is the decay
constant of the specified radionuclide (or the con-
trolling precursor), B is the branching ratio of the
measured gamma ray (photons emitted per disinte-
gration), F is the counting efficiency, AF (area
factor) is the number of square inches of metal
surface with deposited isotopes per square inch
of area normal to the axis of the detector, and the
factor 3.7 x 10'° converts the result to curies.
The absorber factor AB describes the attenuation
between the source and the detector: for the pump
bow!l and piping, point-source slab-shield approxi-
mations were used; in the heat exchanger, the
calculation of AB took into account the details of
the internals.

During the period from 3 to 17 days after shut-
down, the apparatus was set up over the primary
heat exchanger, the pump bowl, the off-gas system
pipe line (line 522), and the primary loop piping
(lines 101 and 102). Some results from these
measurements are summarized in Table 2.1. Five
nuclides are seen to be predominant in the heat
exchanger: °°Nb, °°Mo, !°3Ru, !32Te, and its
daughter 132y. 95Zr, the precursor of I5Nb, was
not detectable. Also significant is the fact that
8-day !3!I (which has a short-lived tellurium
precursor) was not detectable in the heat ex-
changer, although short-lived *%I was. Table 2.1
also shows the relatively large amounts of some
of the radionuclides in the pump bowl and the
off-gas line. The indicated deposition of fission
products varied considerably from point to point
in the heat exchanger. Although it was generally
higher near the inlet of the heat exchanger than
downstream, there was not a uniform gradient.

obtained for ?5Nb at many points on the heat

One may conclude that the technique of gamma
spectrometry of a collimated beam can be very
useful in studying MSRE fission product behavior.

2.3 GAMMA SOURCE MAPPING
WITH PINHOLE CAMERA PHOTOGRAPHY

T. H. Mauney

In conjunction with the gamma spectrometric
measurements described in the preceding section,
gamma-ray sources were mapped by pinhole
camera photography. Film sensitive to both
x rays and visible light (Kodak type KK) was
used in the lead pinhole camera described
previously.* The camera was inserted in an
8-in.-diam hole in the portable maintenance

shield, which was positioned over openings in the
top of the reactor cell. Photographs were developed
quickly for immediate use in locating and selecting
sources to be examined by the gamma spectrometry
being conducted at the time.

The taking of photographs was a rather simple
procedure. The camera was placed in the
maintenance shield, pointing straight down. The
shield was then maneuvered to place the camera
directly above the area to be photographed. Since
there was no shutter on the camera, a sheet-film
holder loaded with the proper film was inserted
in the camera and removed after the desired ex-
posure. When desired, visible-light exposure
could be made shorter than the x-ray exposure
by replacing the holder slide partway through the
X-ray exposure.

Some typical examples of the different photographs
that were made are Fig. 2.6, which looks down on
the fuel pump and adjacent piping, and Fig. 2.7,
which is a photograph of the gamma source in the
portion of the heat exchanger visible to the
camera. Note that what seems to be a corona
around the source is actually a blurring of the
image in the camera.

This work is, so far as we know, the first
attempt to use the technique remotely on in-place
reactor components. As such, the results are

‘MSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Feb. 29, 1968,
ORNL-4254, p. 22.

promising, and we consider the technique worthy
of further development and use. Deficiencies
needing improvement are as follows. Gamma
images were less sharp than desired, hot spots
being blurred. Exposure times for visible-light
images were quite long, up to 45 min in some
cases, because of the limited light intensity
attainable in the cell. Finally, the arrangement
for the camera did not permit tilting for shots
other than vertical.

Improvement on the first two points is expected
from a simple change in the camera aperture. The
diameter of the gamma-ray aperture will be reduced
from ¥ in. to 1/3,2 in., and the visible-light aperture
will be enlarged to 1/32 in, from the original 1/64 in.
The smaller gamma-ray aperture will reduce the
blurring of the source image. Enlarging the visible-
light aperture will speed up the exposure at the
expense of sharpness. But the visible-light images
need not be very sharp, only clear enough for
identification of the components and location of the
source relative to them.

2.4 PUMPS

P. G. Smith A. G. Grindell

2.4.1 Mark 2 Fuel Pump

The preparation of the test facility for operation
with salt® was completed, and check-out of all
systems neared completion. The initial assembly
of the pump rotary element had excessive oil
leakage from the shaft lower seal during cold
shakedown to check the performance of the shaft
bearings and seals. The lower seal rotor had a
scratch across the seal face which caused the
leakage. Upon replacement of the seal rotor,
the rotary element performed satisfactorily. The
rotary element was installed in the test facility.

2.4.2 Oil Pump Endurance Test

The oil pump endurance test® was continued.
By the end of the period, the pump had run for
44,550 hr circulating oil at 160°F and 70 gpm.

3.1 MSRE OPERATING EXPERIENCE

J. L. Redford

All 15 relays in the rod-scram coincidence matrix
were replaced with relays designed for 32-v dc oper-
ation. No more coil failures occurred, but three of
the new relays failed due to contact welding. An
investigation of this problem was launched. No
other difficulties were experienced in the safety
system.

One of the single-point level probes in fuel drain
tank 1 failed. The failure was found to be an open
lead wire inside the cell. The probe was restored
to service by a cross connection outside the cell to
the equivalent lead to the other probe.

The No. 2 fission chamber was replaced. A review
of the history of the chambers used in the wide-range
counting channel indicates an average lifetime in
the neighborhood of about three months. This pre-
sents very little operational difficulty, since the
wide-range counting channel is not utilized during
power operation, and, with the staggered failures
which we have experienced, the installed spare is
usable for any lower power or startup operation when
a single channel fails.

3.2 CONTROL SYSTEM DESIGN

P. G. Herndon

Further additions and modifications were made to
the instrumentation and controls systems as experi-
ence revealed the need or desirability of more infor-
mation for the operators, improved performance, or
increased protection. During the report period there
were 75 design change requests directly involving
instruments or controls. Eleven of these required

43

only changes in process switch operating points, 48
resulted in changes in instruments or controls, and
5 were canceled. All these changes were made in
three areas; the more important ones are described
below.

Fuel Transfer System. — The design of instrumen-
tation and controls for a salt filter in transfer line
110 between the fuel storage tank and the fuel drain
tanks was completed.’

Fuel Frocessing System. — The instruments and
controls for the fuel processing system were revised
as a result of piping and equipment modifications.
Temperature, pressure, and process radiation meas-
uring instruments were provided for the new caustic
scrubber fume filter, the soda-lime trap, and the
deep-bed charcoal trap. Two temperature recorders
were provided to receive signals from additional
thermocouples.

To assure the delivery of fluorine gas at a con-
stant pressure and to improve the control of flow
into the fuel storage tank for a wider range of pro-
cess conditions, a new control system for the flu-
orine gas supply was designed and installed. A
safety shutoff valve was provided to close automa-
tically if flow from the fluorine supply trailer became
excessive.

Contact microphones were attached to the exterior
walls of the fuel storage tank and the caustic scrub-
ber to transmit the process sounds inside the two
vessels. Two fission chambers, one near the fuel
storage tank and the other near the caustic scrubber,
were installed to provide a warning if uranium col-
lected in the caustic scrubber and caused signifi-
cant neutron multiplication in the caustic.

3.3 ANALOG INVESTIGATION OF CONTROL
WITH 233U FUEL

O. W. Burke F. H. Clark

Because of the differences in the dynamics of the
MSRE with 233U fuel, the capability of the existing
rod servo controller was questioned. A test of the
actual control system under simulated ?33U loading

conditions was reported previously.? The capability

2Ibid., p. 32.

of the control system was also investigated by an
analog computer simulation of the MSRE. The sim-
ulated controller was made very realistic by in-
corporating time responses to rod actuation signals
that were measured experimentally in the MSRE
system.

The simulated 233U-fueled MSRE with the simu-
lated controller was subjected to various perturba-
tions. The controlled plant behaved in an acceptable
manner at all power levels.
4. MSRE Reactor Analysis

4.1 DELAYED NEUTRON EFFECTIVENESS

B. E. Prince

Theoretical analysis of neutron dynamics meas-
urements, particularly those designed to help infer
magnitudes of reactivity effects, depends on the
proper interpretation of the delayed neutron be-
havior in the reactor. As a result of the efforts of
many workers, well-developed theoretical and ex-
perimental foundations exist for the analysis of
the most common reactor kinetics measurements. !
The usual practical effort involved in analysis of
any particular reactor is that of bridging the theo-
retical foundations and the experimental data with
adequate numerical approximations.

An important characteristic of delayed neutrons
that must be taken into account in interpreting
kinetics experiments is their energies of emission,
which are lower than those of the prompt neutrons
from fission. In a thermal reactor, such as the
MSRE, the net result of this difference in emission
energy spectra is that the delayed neutrons have
less likelihood of leakage to the surroundings than
the prompt neutrons, so that their contribution to
the chain reaction is enhanced. Thus one is led,
both by theoretical analysis and by physical intui-
tion, to define a ‘‘delayed neutron effectiveness’’
factor y, by which the delay fraction (3, for the ith
precursor group must be multiplied to obtain their
contribution, relative to the prompt neutrons, in
promoting the chain reaction.

Chapter 6 of ref. 1 contains an extensive dis-
cussion of the problem of calculating the delayed
neutron effectiveness factors. Although several

1G. R. Keepin, Physics of Nuclear Kinetics, Addison-
Wesley, Reading, Mass., 1965.

45

measurements of the delayed neutron emission
spectra have been made, sufficient uncertainties
yet exist in the data to suggest that detailed cal-
culations to take into account the shape of the
delayed neutron energy spectra are not always
warranted. For thermal reactors in particular, one
may obtain an adequate estimate of the corrections
arising from these differences in energy spectra by
assuming that all delayed neutrons are emitted with
a single average energy, independent of the pre-
cursor group. According to data taken from ref. 1,
this average energy is approximately 0.43 Mev.
Then y; = y can be computed from the approximate
formula

2
tB(T ~ 1)
)7 =€ P d ’ (1)
in which B? is the geometric buckling correspond-
ing to the ““nuclear” size of the core and (A and
7, are the values of the average age to thermal
energy for prompt fission neutrons and for delayed

(41

neutrons respectively.

The foregoing procedure is strictly applicable to
reactors with fixed fuel. In application to the
MSRE, additional complications arise from the
motion of the precursors due to fuel circulation. ?
The applications to the MSRE considered here are
confined to measurements made with no circula-
tion of the fuel. With qualifications depending on
the accuracy required, the energy corrections cal-
culated from the above formula may also be applied
when the fuel is circulating.

We recently performed calculations of the energy-
effectiveness corrections for 8 in the MSRE, based

’B. E. Prince, Period Measurements on the Molten
Salt Reactor Experiment During Fuel Circulation:
Theory and Experiment, QRNL-TM-1626 (October 1366).
on the simple recipe described above. The age

to the thermal cutoff energy (0.876 ev in MSRE
studies) was obtained by use of the GAM-2 pro-
gram.® For a salt-graphite composition equal to
that of the channeled region of the core and a
temperature of 1200°F, the age calculated for the
prompt fission neutrons was 251.9 cm?. When
calculated for both the 235U fissile loading of the
preceding MSRE runs and the new loading of 233U,
these results were found to be very nearly inde-
pendent of the fissile composition. Based on a
geometric buckling corresponding to a cylinder

29 x 78 in. (R x H), the value of ¥ calculated from
Eq. (1) was 1.086. This implies, for example, that
the total effective delayed neutron fraction for use
in experimental measurements of reactivity effects
for 235U is 0.71%, compared with the absolute
delay fraction of 0.65%. The magnitude of this
energy-effectiveness correction is higher than the
correction obtained in earlier studies? by a factor
of 1.05. This difference is not surprising, how-
ever, in view of the necessity in the earlier
studies of using a less sophisticated computation
of the difference in the average age of prompt and
delayed neutrons.

The upward revision of our calculated value of
¥ has some interesting implications regarding the
interpretation of reactivity measurements made
with the 235U fuel loading. Since the magnitudes
of reactivity inferred from these experiments are
relative to the effective delayed neutron fraction,
this would imply that all reactivity effects should
be larger by a factor of approximately 1.05 than
the values based on the earlier calculations of
the energy correction. In the results reported in
ref. 5, this would have the effect of increasing
the difference between the experimental and cal-
culated worths of the MSRE control rods but would
tend to bring the measured isothermal temperature
and 235U concentration coefficients of reactivity
into better agreement with the calculated values.
The direction of these changes is in accord with

what one might expect from an intuitive stand-
point because, of the various reactivity effects,
the accurate numerical computation of the rod
worth presents the most difficulty.

4.2 THEORETICAL DYNAMIC ANALYSIS
FOR 233y FUEL

R. C. Steffy P. J. Wood

The MSRE with 233U fuel will have a lower
fraction of delayed neutrons, a larger negative
temperature coefficient of reactivity, and a longer
prompt neutron lifetime than when fueled with
2357.6 Each of these factors affects the dynamic
behavior of the reactor. Because of these differ-
ences in important system parameters, an analysis
was performed for the 233U-fueled MSRE to pre-
dict both the reactor time response and the fre-
quency response to reactivity perturbations, and
also to establish the linear stability of the system
as described by the theoretical model. The math-
ematical model used to describe the system was
essentially the same linearized model used suc-
cessfully by Kerlin and Ball? to predict the
dynamic behavior of the MSRE with 235U fuel. We
did alter the model slightly to account for more
mixing of the fuel salt during circulation. The
experimental results?® of the earlier testing pro-
grams showed the desirability of this change.

4.2.1 Time Response

The system time response was calculated by the
MATEXP computer code? using the coefficients
of the model equations as well as the nonlinear
terms of the neutron kinetics equations as input.

Fig. 4.1 Predicted Power Response with 233U Fuel to a Step Reactivity lnput of 0.02% Ok/k at Various Initial

Power Levels.,
in reactivity (0.02% 6k/k) is shown in Fig. 4.1 at
various initial power levels. The response be-
comes less oscillatory and the damping coeffi-
cient increases as the power level is increased.
At the higher power levels the power rises
sharply after a step increase in reactivity, but the
temperature effects in the core promptly counter-
balance the reactivity input, and the power de-
creases toward its initial level. However, before
returning to its initial level, the power levels out
on a transient plateau. It stays at this level until
~17 sec after the reactivity perturbation; then it
again begins to decrease. The power plateau is
observed because a quasi steady state exists in
the core region. The inlet temperature is the
same as it was before the perturbation, and the
core nuclear average temperature has increased
enough to compensate for the reactivity change.
After ~17 sec (the transient time of the extemal
loop) the return of higher-temperature salt in-
creases the inlet temperature and introduces
negative reactivity through the negative tempera-
ture coefficient. After sufficient time the reactor
returns to the initial power level, at which time
the net increase in nuclear average temperature
compensates for the step reactivity input.

4.2.2 Frequency-Response Calculations

The frequency response of a system is a good
indicator of the dynamic response and stability of
the system. Unlike many of the pure stability
criteria, the frequency response may be directly
verified by performing experiments on the system.
In the calculations for the MSRE the pure stability
criteria are applied to the same model which is
used to calculate the frequency response. Experi-
mental determination of the frequency response
(planned as part of the testing program for 233U
operation) 1% will help to establish the degree of
confidence that can be placed in the model and
hence in the stability calculations. Excellent
agreement was obtained between the calculated
and experimentally determined frequency response
for the 235U fuel loading, and we have no reason
to expect anything other than good agreement for
the 233U fuel loading.

Curves showing the calculated power-to-
reactivity frequency response for the 233U-fueled
MSRE are shown in Fig. 4.2. Since a high peak
implies more oscillatory response, Fig. 4.2 shows
that the system will be less oscillatory at higher
power levels. The dip in the amplitude ratio
curves at ~0.25 radian/sec corresponds to the
fuel transit time of ~25 sec. Since the amplitude
ratio was relatively low at this frequency with the
235y fuel, the dip was not as distinct. However,
the amplitude ratio with the 233U fuel remains high
to >1 radian/sec; so the dip is emphasized.

Power and reactivity are the two parameters
most often compared in reactor frequency-response
calculations. However, the frequency response of
any two system parameters may be calculated,
relative to each other, so long as the parameter
appears in the system equations. Of most practi-
cal interest are the frequency-response calcula-
tions involving measurable quantities. The fre-
quency response of the reactor outlet temperature
relative to power is shown in Fig. 4.3. The
assumed temperature-sensing device is a thermo-
couple located on the outside of a pipe. In order
to calculate a frequency response which is repre-
sentative of quantities which may be measured in
the testing program, additional equations were
added to the model to represent the response of
the thermocouple to a change in temperature at
the inside of the pipe. Figure 4.3 also shows
the response of the thermocouple-measured outlet
temperature relative to power. The effect of
assuming more salt mixing in the circulation loop
is also shown.

4.2.3 Stability Analysis

A necessary and sufficient condition for linear
asymptotic stability is that all the eigenvalues of
the set of system equations have negative real
parts. In the determination of linear asymptotic
stability, the previously mentioned linearized
model was used, except that a Padé approxima-
tion replaced the pure time delays in representing
salt flow around the external loop. Several of the
dominant eigenvalues (those closest to the imagi-
nary axis) are shown in Table 4.1. As expected,
at all power levels where temperature effects are
significant, the eigenvalues have negative real
parts which increase in absolute value as the
power level increases. When all temperature

effects were neglected (zero power), both the real
and imaginary parts of the dominant eigenvalue
were zero.!! An eigenvalue at the origin is typi-
cal of a zero-power reactor.

Whereas the real parts of the eigenvalues de-
termine the absolute stability, the damping ratio
gives a better indication of relative stability.
The damping ratio, &, is related to the angle, f3,
which a vector from the origin to the dominant
eigenvalue makes with the imaginary axis, through
the relation

tan 8
V1+tan2 f8

Table 4.2 shows the damping ratio as a function of
power level. A lower value of £ implies a more
oscillatory system. The values in Table 4.2 were
calculated from the eigenvalue with the smallest
real part which also had a nonzero imaginary com-

1rhe value actually calculated was —0.365 X 10~7
for the real part and 0.0 for the imaginary. By changing
the value of one coefficient in the system equations in
the fifth significant digit, we were able to change the
real part of the eigenvalue to a small positive value.
The absolute accuracy of these coefficients is probably
no more than four significant digits. The fact that the
calculated number is not identically zero only shows
that absolute precision was not maintained in the cal-
culations. Furthermore, while stability is defined very
precisely from a mathematical standpoint, the actual
response characteristic of a power reactor system with
a dominant eigenvalue at —10—6 would be indistin-
guishable from that of a system with one at +10—6.

ponent. Since there are a number of eigenvalues
which have about the same amplitude, this damp-
ing ratio alone cannot be used to determine system
response, but it does serve as a relative indicator
of oscillatory behavior. From the & values we
must again conclude that the system is highly
stable at high power levels and that it becomes
more oscillatory and more sluggish at lower powers.
The Mikhailov stability technique has recently
been modified by Wright and Kerlin!? so that
equations containing pure time-delay terms can
be handled. The modifications also included
amplitude and phase normalization, so that the
Mikhailov criterion is now valuable in stability
analysis. In this analysis the system equations
are Laplace transformed and then manipulated
following the rules of matrix algebra to give a
vector which may be plotted as a function of

frequency. If the tip of the vector makes any net
encirclements of the origin as the frequency is
varied from — to +o, the system is unstable. The
vector motion is symmetric with respect to the
frequency variable, so only the points correspond-
ing to frequencies between 0 and +®need be
plotted. Plots for the MSRE at 8 and 0.1 Mw are
shown in Figs. 4.4 and 4.5. In none of the plots
are there net encirclements of the origin; so at
these power levels, system stability is again
demonstrated. Similar analyses at other power
levels showed the system to be absolutely stable
except at zero power, where the line passes
through the origin.!3 This is in agreement with
the eigenvalue calculation at zero power and is
characteristic of zero-power reactors.

In summary, it has been shown by several tech-
niques that the MSRE will be stable at all power

levels and that the degree of stability increases
with the power level. The initial response of the
power to a reactivity perturbation will be faster

for the 233U fuel loading than it was with the 235U
fuel; however, the damping coefficient is also
larger, so the power level will return to its initial
state faster.

13As in the eigenvalue calculation, the accuracy of
the calculation prevented obtaining a solution exactly
equal to zero. The calculated line actually crossed the
real axis at+8.2 X 10—8. From a practical standpoint,
this must be recognized as zero.

5.1 GENERAL

E. S. Bettis R. C. Robertson

We have continued the design studies of the
single-fluid molten-salt breeder reactor described
in our last semiannual progress report.! Several
significant changes were made in the design de-
scribed there. One notable difference is the re-
duction in the capacity of the MSBR reference
design plant from 2000 Mw (electrical) to 1000
Mw (electrical). Although the single-fluid MSBR
concept is well suited for larger sizes of reactors,
and many of the performance factors and the power
production costs would be more favorable in larger
units, we decided that the evaluation of the refer-
ence plant should be on the same basis as the
majority of other current power reactor studies.

Another important modification of the design was
our decision to replace graphite by removing the
entire reactor core as a unit assembly rather than
by withdrawing a few elements at a time, as had
been assumed in all the previous concepts for the
single-fluid MSBR. This required changes in the
high-bay containment arrangement, as will be ex-
plained subsequently.

Rept. Feb. 29, 1968, ORNL-4254 (August 1968).

53

Other significant changes were_made in the re-
actor and heat exchanger equipment, the flow-
sheets, and plant layouts. The majority of these
revisions were brought about by refinements in the
nuclear physics calculations, in the physical prop-
erties of the fuel and coolant salts, and in esti-
mates of the afterheat and stress problems.

Some general data for the reference design are
listed in Table 5.1.

5.2 PLANT LAYOUT

E. S. Bettis H. M. Poly H. L. Watts

The overall concept for the MSBR plant is much
the same as was previously reported,! but we have
made significant changes in a few particular areas.
As shown in Fig. 5.1, the reactor cell contains the
reactor vessel, four primary pumps, and four primary
heat exchangers. The steam cells house the four
secondary pumps, the steam generators, and the
steam reheaters.? Other cells provide for reactor
auxiliary systems, for fuel processing systems, for
storage of a spent reactor core and a primary heat
exchanger tube bundle removed from service, and

’We have substituted *“primary?’ for ““fuel salt’® and
““secondary?’’ for ‘“coolant salt’” in the designation of
MSBR reactor plant equipment.

for work space to dismantle these radioactive items
of equipment.

The dimensions of the cells are shown in Figs.
5.1 and 5.2. All the cells except the primary and
secondary drain tank cells are above grade. Double
containment is provided for all the cells which nor-
mally contain radioactive materials. The reactor
cell has thermal shielding at the cell wall to pre-
vent overheating of the concrete biological shield-
ing by incident radiation. The reinforced concrete
structure at the top of the reactor cell was analyzed
for stresses, and the maximum deflection of the 63-
ft-diam slab was found to be acceptable under the
fully loaded conditions.

A basic change in the layout is that the high-bay
area over the reactor cell, storage cells, and core
assembly and disassembly space is a separate
containment area within the reactor plant confine-
ment building. This provides an additional barrier
to the escape of airborne radioactive particles and

56

gases and helps to avoid spread of contamination
during maintenance operations. This change was
dictated by our decision to remove the reactor core
as a unit rather than by taking a few graphite ele-
ments at a time.

We have changed the method of supporting the
equipment in the reactor cell; it will now hang
from the overhead structure rather than resting
on pedestals on the cell floor. The supports are
shown in Fig. 5.2. The reactor vessel closure
seal is now in a lower-temperature, less radio-
active environment. Each primary heat exchanger
is hung from a pivot point near the center of the
shell. This permits the shell to rotate slightly
to accommodate the differential thermal expan-
sion in the inlet and outlet primary salt lines.

The primary heat exchangers move outward toward
the cell wall under thermal expansion, and clear-
ance for this movement has been provided in the
shield plugs.

The primary-salt piping was analyzed for stresses,
and all values were found to be within the accept-
able limits. We removed the expansion bellows
previously shown in the secondary-salt lines for
the 2000-Mw (electrical) plant. In a 1000-Mw (elec-
trical) MSBR station these lines are small enough
for expansion loops to provide the necessary flexi-
bility.

5.3 FLOWSHEET

J. R. McWherter  H. M. Poly Dunlap Scott

A new flowsheet was drawn and is shown in Fig.
5.3. For simplicity, only one of the four primary
circulating loops and one of the secondary circu-
lating loops have been shown on the flowsheet.

In general, only one item of equipment in multiple
installations is included.

Most of the mass flow rates shown on the flow-
sheet are about one-half those shown in previous
reports for a 2000-Mw (electrical) MSBR plant.
Some of the changes in the quantities shown are
due to revisions in the salt physical property data.
The properties now in use in the MSBR design
studies are given in Table 5.2. Some of the aux-
iliary systems not shown on previous flowsheets
have also been included.

A flow of secondary salt is no longer bypassed
around the steam generators as it was in previous
concepts. This change, which significantly re-
duces the secondary-salt flow requirements, was

made on the basis of new physical property data
for the salts and on revised calculations which
indicate that the secondary salt can be returned
to the primary heat exchangers at as low a tem-
perature as 850°F without danger of freezing the
primary salt, even though the latter has a liquidus
temperature of about 930°F. This assumption is
supported by the estimate of the film temperature
drops and the tube wall resistance to heat transfer.
The full-flow gas separator shown in the primary-
salt line on previous flowsheets has been elimi-
nated. We now pass only about 10% of the salt
flow through a gas separator. The stripped gases
and entrained salt are then passed through an en-
trainment separator, the collected salt being re-
turned to the pump bowl. The purge gas from the
pump bowl is also freed of salt in this same en-
trainment separator. The off-gas from the en-
trainment separator is very radioactive, and from
evidence obtained in the MSRE, it can be expected
to contain particles of noble metals in suspension.
A holdup tank is provided in the off-gas line to
cool the gas and to extract the metal and other
decay product particulates. A fluid, possibly
liquid bismuth, is sprayed into the holdup tank in
direct contact with the off-gas. This fluid is cir-
culated in a closed loop consisting of the holdup
tank, pump, heat exchanger, and chemical process-
ing system for cleanup. The heat transport medium
circulated through the exchanger is coolant salt
taken from the natural convection coolant-salt sys-
tem used to remove heat from the primary-salt drain
tanks.

5.4 REACTOR VESSEL AND CORE

The basic design of the reactor for a single-fluid
MSBR is for the fuel salt to move upward in single-
pass flow through graphite moderator prisms, or ele-
ments, mounted vertically in a Hastelloy N tank.
Although simple in concept, much of the MSBR de-
sign study effort has been spent in investigating
the many possible arrangements to approach an
optimum configuration. There have been numerous
refinements to the design concept as more informa-
tion became available on graphite behavior, salt
properties, nuclear performance, and on heat
transfer and stress conditions.

We no longer use a permanently installed metal
grid for locating the moderator prisms within the
core. It was possible to eliminate the grid when
we decided to remove and replace the core graphite
as a unit rather than by individual or small groups
of elements. A core ‘‘basket’’ is now used to re-
tain the graphite. The basket can be preassembled
by direct approach, and a jig would assure correct
alignment of the prisms. When the peripheral region
of the core is filled with the graphite spheres, as
will be discussed subsequently, the core graphite
will be held in position and the assembly jig can
be removed. The basket is installed inside the re-

ry
‘e

59

actor vessel as a unit assembly. When it becomes
necessary to replace the graphite the basket can
be lifted from the reactor along with the top head
of the vessel.

The graphite rests on the bottom of the core re-
tainer basket when the reactor is drained of salt
and bears against the top head when the vessel
is filled. The prisms are tapered at the top, which,
together with a molded extension, provides a flow
passage across the top of the graphite for the
leaving fuel salt. This arrangement gives a high
fuel-to-graphite ratio region at the top of the re-
actor to act as an undermoderated ‘‘blanket.’” The
molded extension also allows for orificing the cen-
ter holes in the elements and in the interstices to
approach a uniform temperature rise of the fuel salt
over the entire cross-sectional flow area of the
core. Reactor performance was of course improved
by elimination of the metallic grid work which acted
as a nuclear poison.

Physics calculations to optimize the nuclear per-
formance and to determine the salt fractions and
exact shape of the salt flow passages are not yet
complete. Figure 5.4, however, indicates the gen-
eral cross-sectional shape of the elements. They
are about 4 in. square with projections on each
face and a central hole about 0.6 in. in diameter
to form the salt flow channels. The flow channels
between the elements are about 0.4 in. wide, and
all the flow passages have equal hydraulic diam-
eters. When assembled in a square array the 1248
prisms form an octagonal matrix, as shown in Fig.
5.5. With this particular configuration, about 16%
of the core volume will be salt, but the dimensions
can be adjusted to provide the salt fraction speci-
fied from the physics analysis. The absence of
sharp corners on the elements will facilitate fab-
rication by extrusion, and the flat surface at the
points of contact of a rib with an adjacent element
will permit relative movement without damage.

Hydraulic analyses indicate that the pressure
drop of the salt in flowing through the moderator
is about 34 psi along the axial center line of the
reactor core. This estimate is based on a 92-w/cc
maximum core power density and a 250°F tempera-
ture rise of the salt in passing through the core and
will have to be adjusted to conform to the final de-
sign values. At other radial locations in the core
the flow rates are necessarily less in order to
produce the desired 250°F rise. As mentioned
previously, the additional pressure drop needed
at these locations to produce a total Ap of 34 psi

is obtained by the use of orifices at the top of the
graphite moderator elements. The total static pres-
sure at the top of the core, including the gas over-
pressure, is about 55 psi.

The peripheral space between the octagonal-
shaped core and the cylindrical walls of the basket
is filled with graphite spheres about 4 in. in diam-
eter, as shown in Fig. 5.6. These balls serve a
dual purpose. The fuel-to-graphite ratio is higher
in this volume, and, by being undermoderated,
there is much lower fission rate and the leakage
of neutrons from the core is substantially reduced.
Secondly, the balls are buoyant in the salt and
exert a radial pressure tending to keep the core
elements compacted. A hold-down plate is pro-
vided at the top of the core to keep the balls in
place and to introduce a high resistance to salt
flow through the ball region. The bulk of the salt
entering this space will move radially inward into
the active core region in its transit through the re-
actor. The flow in the blanket region is estimated
to be only about 10% of the total salt mass flow
rate.

The new arrangement provides for removal of the
core as a unit assembly rather than by withdrawal
of a few graphite elements at a time. We plan to
use a spare top head assembly and a core basket
for the replacement operation. The spent core
would first be drawn up into a transport cask,
moved laterally, and lowered into the spent core
cell for decay and disposal. The top head assembly
would be decontaminated from all but induced ac-
tivity and reused in a future graphite replacement
operation. The spare head and the core, which had
been previously assembled by direct approach under
shop conditions, would be standing by, and the sub-
stitution could be made relatively quickly. This
maintenance arrangement is believed to require less
capital investment and downtime.

The core basket is a complete assembly contain-
ing the core elements, the blanket spheres, and the
reflector graphite. The dished bottom of the basket
is about 2 in. thick and has a central inlet opening
for the salt. A flat plate is located about 10 in.
above the opening to support the central graphite
when the vessel is empty. The cylindrical shell of
the basket has a % -in. clearance between it and
the vessel wall to allow an upward flow of fuel
salt for vessel cooling. Eight 2-in.-OD Hastel-
loy N lifting rods extend to the bottom of the
basket to carry the weight when it is lifted. Ra-
diation damage to the basket material is of less

concern than damage to the reactor vessel wall,
since the basket would be replaced along with the
graphite.

The reactor tank is a Hastelloy N vessel about
18 ft in diameter and 16 ft high at the center line
of the two dished heads. The wall thickness is
about 2 in., and the lower head is 3 in. thick. The
top dished head is 2 in. thick, but also has a 2-
in.-thick thermal shield on the inside to the lower
neutron fluence to ensure that radiation damage in
this high-temperature region will be within allow-
able limits. As seen in Fig. 5.6, the top head is
attached through a forging to a 9-ft-high cylindrical
extension which carries a flange at the top to mate
with the upper flange on the extended wall of the
reactor vessel. This arrangement allows the vessel
closure to be more accessible and in a zone that
has lower temperature and less radioactivity. The
flanges have double metal gaskets to effect a gas-
tight seal and to provide a space for leak detection.
These gaskets would be replaced each time a new
reactor core is installed. The upper flanges rest
on the structure near the top of the cell and support
the entire reactor vessel assembly.

Preliminary calculations indicate that the stresses
in the reactor vessel heads and walls are within
the allowable limits. We have also investigated
the effect of the neutron fluence on the design life
of the plant. While it appears that the conditions
are acceptable, if further refinements show that mod-
ifications are necessary, thermal shields can be
used to bring the doses to within tolerable levels.
We are presently showing a thermal shield for the
top head, since this is the highest temperature re-
gion in the reactor. The bottom of the basket acts
as a thermal shield for the bottom head.

As indicated in Fig. 5.5, provisions have been
made at the center of the core for four control rods.
The rods have not been fully studied, but their
function is primarily for making adjustments and
for convenience in startup operations, etc. The
load-following and safety aspects of the MSBR are
largely provided by the negative temperature coef-
ficient of reactivity. We have not found a need for
a rapid-acting drive mechanism, and in fact it may
not be desirable in this type of reactor to provide
a mechanism which establishes this as a possi-
bility. The present concept for the rods is shown
in Fig. 5.7. Graphite cylinders about 3% in. in
diameter are driven down into the salt by a rack
and chain mechanism to increase the reactivity of
the core. Flow passages in the rod permit upward

5.5 PRIMARY HEAT EXCHANGERS

C. E. Bettis H. A. McLain H. L. Watts

There are four vertical, single-pass, counterflow
primary heat exchangers which transfer heat from
the primary salt to the secondary salt. An ele-
vation of a primary heat exchanger is shown in
Fig. 5.8, and the principal data are listed in

Table 5.3.

“An enhancement factor of 2.0 is assumed for inside
the tubes and 1.3 outside the tubes through use of
knurled tubing. Salt properties are those listed in Table
5.1.

Primary salt circulates in single-pass flow inside
the tubes from top to bottom of the exchanger.
There are about 5700 tubes, 3/8 in. OD x 0.035 in.
wall thickness, approximately 20 ft long, in each
of the four exchangers. The secondary salt flows
on the shell side from bottom to top through disk
and doughnut baffles. In order to minimize the
fuel salt volume in the exchangers we propose to
use a special tubing. The tubes are knurled to
produce shallow, spiraled convolutions along the
length. This treatment has been found in tests
with water to be effective in increasing the overall
heat transfer coefficient, although at the expense
of an increased pressure drop.

We completed an optimization code for calculating
the performance of the heat exchangers. Full uti-
lization of the code awaited reliable physical
property data for the salts, but recently available
values will make it possible to optimize the heat
exchanger design. The heat exchanger data listed
in Table 5.3 are based on the new salt properties
given in Table 5.1 and are the initial result of use
of the new code. Further refinements and revisions
will probably be required when the vibration and
stress studies are complete, and some of the num-
bers may need adjustment.

The tubing for the primary exchangers would be
fabricated and installed under strict quality control
conditions, and past experience indicates that a
high degree of reliability could be achieved. To
take care of the possibility of tube failure, how-
ever, after studying the maintenance aspects, we
decided to design on the basis of removal of an
entire tube bundle rather than to attempt to repair
individual tubes in the highly radioactive environ-
ment. The heat exchanger shells and connecting
piping would be permanently installed, although
these could be replaced by nonroutine remote
maintenance techniques in the unlikely event
that this need arose.

A heat exchanger tube bundle consists of tubes
running vertically between the upper and lower
tube sheets. As shown in Fig. 5.8, the top sheet
has a hole in the center through which the sec-
ondary salt downcomer passes. A flanged joint
at one end of this central pipe and a slip joint
at the other permit removal of the bundle. The
tube bundle is clamped onto a ring at the top of
the shell in order to resist the hydraulic forces
due to salt flow. A seal weld is made around the
clamped joint to ensure separation of the primary
and secondary salt circuits. When removing a tube

the weld and to reweld the joint after a new bundle

5.6 PRIMARY DRAIN SYSTEM

H. A. McLain
J. R. McWherter

Dunlap Scott
W. K. Furlong

One drain tank, about 13 ft in diameter x 20 ft
high, provides storage volume for the approximately
1500 ft3 of salt in the primary circulating system.
The general features of the tank are much as de-
scribed in a previous report,! although the dimen-
sions and heat transfer area require revisions be-
cause the plant design capacity is now 1000 Mw
(electrical). These changes are in progress.

The natural-convection cooling system for the
drain tank was also described previously.! This
system utilizes thimbles in the drain tank to
transfer the afterheat in the primary salt to a
sodium fluoroborate coolant salt which is circu-
lated by natural convection to cooling coils lo-
cated in the base of a natural draft stack. There
the heat is transferred to the ambient air. A sys-
tem of dampers and heaters would prevent the drain
tank coolant salt from freezing when it is not re-
quired to transport the heat. Again, the features
of the system remain essentially unchanged but
revisions are needed. A very preliminary analysis
of the heat transfer coefficient between the primary
salt in the tank and the circulating coolant salt in
the thimbles indicates that it is in the order of
50 Btu hr=1! ft=2 (°F)~! rather than the higher
value previously reported.

We studied the drain system piping during the
past report period and decided to locate the drain
valve in the drain line inside the reactor cell.

With this layout any break in the valve or in the
piping would make use of the catch pan and direct
the spilled primary salt to the drain tank.

The arrangement of the drain line is schemati-
cally as indicated on the flowsheet, Fig. 5.3. The
drain line connects to the bottom (inlet) plenum of
the reactor vessel, and the drain valve is located
about 14 ft downstream from this connection. Since
the salt in the drain line must be circulated to pre-
vent excessive self-heating, a connection has been
provided just upstream of the freeze valve to a
manifold connecting the tanks of each of the four
primary pumps. Salt flowing through this line

66

provides a constant flow of 1050°F salt through
the drain line. This cool salt also provides wall
cooling for the pump bowls.

On the drain tank side of the drain valve, the
line must be vented in order for the line to drain
free of salt. The 7z-in. line provided for this pur-
pose has a mechanical valve located well above
any salt levels in the system.

The drain valve is the frozen salt type and has
not yet been studied in detail. There is a back-
ground of satisfactory experience with freeze
valves in the MSRE, however. A gas-cooling
system will be used for freezing the plug in the
valve and for keeping it frozen. When a drain is
to be made, hot rather than cool gas will be sup-
plied.

The catch basin, or pan, referred to above is in
our present thinking connected to the drain tank
through a U-tube trap. This trap is filled with
molten bismuth which under normal conditions
serves as a seal between the drain tank contents
and the reactor cell volume. If primary salt is
spilled into the catch basin, the accumulated head
of salt in the line would displace the bismuth from
the U-tube and allow the salt to flow into the drain
tank. A catch tank is located downstream from the
U-tube to trap the bismuth and prevent it from en-
tering the tank along with the salt. If secondary
salt rather than primary salt were to spill into the
catch basin, its density would not be sufficient to
displace the bismuth, and there would be no flow.
A mechanical valve is provided between the U-trap
and the drain tank so that the vessel can be pres-
surized for transfer of the primary salt from the
tank. This valve would not contact the salt except
in the unlikely event of an accidental spill. It
is within the current technology to fabricate a
valve for such service.

5.7 MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES AND
EQUIPMENT

Robert Blumberg  E. C. Hise

Study was begun of the maintenance procedures
and equipment needed to replace the graphite in
the reactor core and to repair or replace the pump
rotary elements and primary heat exchangers. Three
major pieces of maintenance equipment will be re-
quired: (1) a reactor cell transition piece which
extends the cell containment above the elevation
of the pump motors and has a slide closure at the
x

top, (2) a similar transition piece for the spent-
components cells, (3) a track-mounted shielded
transport cask with internal hoist.

Major attention has been given to the replacement
of the reactor moderator assembly, since the radio-
activity level would be highest in this operation.

It is estimated that ten days after reactor shutdown
the heat generation in the spent core would be
about 240 kw (thermal). This amount of heat could
be dissipated without need for cooling of the core
when in transit. The radiation level on the surface
of the shielded transport cask would be reduced to
less than 1000 r/hr; how much less remains to be
established.

The procedure for replacing the reactor moderator
is tentatively visualized as follows: During reactor
cooldown the replacement core assembly is readied.
The upper shielding blocks are then removed from
the cell, and the reactor closure is unbolted. The
building crane then places the transition pieces
over the reactor cell and the spent core cells.

The transport cask is moved over the reactor cell
and sealed to the transition piece. After the slide
closures on the transition piece and the cask are
opened, the lifting device inside the cask is en-

67

gaged with the reactor vessel head and its con-
nected core basket assembly. After all personnel
have withdrawn to a shielded maintenance control
room, the spent core is drawn up into the cask.
The slide openings on the transition piece and
cask are then closed. The cask is moved into
position over the spent core cell, coupled to its
transition piece, the slides are opened, and the
core is lowered into the cell for subsequent decay,
decontamination and recovery of the top head of
the reactor vessel, and disposal of the graphite
and the core basket assembly. The replacement
top head and core assembly is then raised into the
cask, the cask is again sealed to the reactor cell
transition piece, the slides are opened, and the
assembly is lowered part way into the reactor
vessel. At this point the radiation sources are
adequately shielded for personnel to return to the
high-bay area to supervise final placement of the
moderator assembly in the reactor vessel. After
the cask and transition pieces are returned to
their storage areas at the end of the reactor
plant, the vessel closure can be completed and
the shielding blocks replaced.

6.1 PHYSICS ANALYSIS OF MSBR

0. L. Smith
W. R. Cobb H. T. Kerr

A substantial portion of the physics work on the
MSBR since the last progress report was devoted
to developing improved computational tools for
analyzing the MSBR performance. The OPTIMERC
code previously used was deficient for two princi-
pal reasons: (1) it could not accommodate multiple
thermal-neutron energy groups, and (2) it was con-
strained to use the same spectrum-averaged cross
sections of any one nuclide in all regions of the
reactor. This latter point was particularly impor-
tant with respect to thorium, since the resonance
integral of this nuclide differs markedly in the
core and in the blanket regions of the reactor.

Both of these limitations have now been removed
in a new version of OPTIMERC known as ROD
(Reactor Optimum Design). A number of other
improvements have also been incorporated in ROD,
the most important of which is in the treatment of
two-dimensional neutronic effects (e.g., in R-Z
geometry) by synthesizing two one-dimensional
calculations (e.g., an R calculation and a Z cal-
culation).

A new optimization calculation of the MSBR has
been performed with ROD using five epithermal
energy groups and four thermal groups. Further-
more, in this calculation each region of the reactor
has assigned to it a set of cross sections appro-
priate to the neutron spectrum in that region. In
particular, each blanket region has thorium cross
sections appropriate to the volume fraction of salt
in that particular region.

The calculation was performed in synthesized
right-cylindrical geometry. The reactor design was
optimized with respect to yield, except that

processing cycle times were specified to limit
processing cost. A minimum of constraints was
imposed on the calculation, any or all of which
may ultimately be removed. The reactor was per-
mitted only two salt fractions, one in the core and
one in the blanket. The salt fraction in the axial
blanket was fixed at 0.85. All salt fractions ex-
cept the axial blanket fraction were optimized.

All dimensions were optimized. The rare-earth
processing cycle time was fixed at 50 days, the
protactinium processing at 3 days, and the salt
replacement life at 5 years. The primary salt con-
tained approximately 16 mole % Ber, 12 mole %

ThF4, and 71.7 mole % LiF.

The results of the calculation are shown in In all cases listed in Table 6.2, the reactor

1.077, a yield of 4.1%, and a graphite lifetime of tains 37% salt by volume. The reactor perform-

report period, using OPTIMERC, to investigate 5, which has a core salt fraction of 0.16 and
the nuclear performance of a single-fluid MSBR which corresponds to a reactor containing the

and blanket regions of the reactor. The calcula- elements).

tions are summarized in Table 6.2. It should be
noted that the OPTIMERC calculation, as applied
in these cases, overestimates the breeding ratio

by as much as 0.01, and hence overestimates the
yield also. This results primarily from neglect of
axial neutron leakage. This defect was not present
in calculations of the two-fluid MSBR’s reported
earlier, nor is it present in the ROD calculations
described above.

Case 4 corresponds to a reactor with an oriented
bed of balls in the core and a random-packed bed
in the blanket. Oriented packing of the core im-
proves the performance of the reactor because of
the more nearly optimum salt fraction (™~ 0.27).
The oriented bed does not appear feasible, since

Cases 6 through 8 show that a reflector is un-
desirable with a core having a large salt fraction.
The reflector greatly increases neutron produc-
tion at the edge of the core and hence increases
leakage.

Cases 1, 8, and 9 indicate that in the random-
packed bed reactors the yield and graphite life-
times are optimized with reactor diameters of
~~ 25 ft, although the inventory charges are some-
what higher than for smaller diameters.

In cases 10 through 13 the graphite density in
the blanket was reduced with the objective of
hardening the blanket spectrum, hence decreasing
neutron production (and leakage) and increasing
resonance capture in the blanket thorium. Com-
parison of case 13 with case 8 shows that this
device improves the yield ~7 %.

From these calculations one can see that the
maximum annual fuel yield achievable with a
random-packed bed of graphite balls is less than
2%. The inventory charges are typically 0.3 to
0.4 mill/kwhr (electrical), and the graphite lifetime
is from 3 to 6 years.

6.2 PHYSICS ANALYSIS OF MSBE

O. L. Smith W. R. Cobb

A series of preliminary calculations was per-
formed to determine the breeding ratio, the peak

70

power density (per unit volume of core), and the
maximum fast damage flux (E_ > 50 kev) obtainable
in a low-power [100 to 200 Mw (thermal)] MSBE.
The calculations were performed with the two-
dimensional EXTERMINATOR code. Various core-
blanket configurations were considered, as shown
in Table 6.3. All cases were normalized to 100
Mw (thermal). The salt contained 12-14 mole %
ThF,, 20 mole % BeF ,, and 67.7—65.7 mole % LiF.
The breeding ratio reported is the value at start-
of-life conditions, assuming pure 233U as fuel.
Thus, for example, no allowance is made for fission
product or protactinium losses. The reactors were
unreflected, with the exception of case 10, which
had a 1-ft-thick graphite reflector. In all cases

the blanket was 100% salt.

From cases 5, 6, and 7 one can see that a low-
power reactor [~ 125 Mw (thermal)] can achieve a
peak damage flux and a peak power density com-
parable with a large MSBR (5 x 10'* neutrons
cm~—2 sec—! and 100 w/cm? respectively), but a
breeding ratio of only ~~ 0.9 and a core power frac-
tion of only ~0.33.

On the other hand, cases 15 through 20 show that
a somewhat higher-power reactor [175 to 200 Mw
(thermal)] can achieve the same peak damage flux
and power density as a large MSBR, a breeding
ratio greater than unity, and a core power fraction
of at least 0.5.

7.1 NOBLE-GAS MIGRATION IN THE MSBR
REFERENCE DESIGN

R. J. Kedl

Noble-gas migration in a conceptual version of
the two-fluid MSBR was discussed in some detail
in a previous progress report.! The concept of
using circulating helium bubbles for stripping noble
gases from the fuel salt was presented. At that
time, all the bubbles were injected into the fuel
salt at the core outlet and removed from the salt at
the core inlet. The objective was to keep the core
nominally free of bubbles and to avoid any effects
that they might have on reactivity. A recent change
in ground rules allows up to 1% bubbles by volume
of salt in the core. This greatly simplified the
noble-gas stripping problem, because we can now
recirculate the bubbles many times around the fuel
loop and let them approach much closer to satura-
tion. The result is that the volumetric flow rate of
helium in the gas system is considerably reduced.
Also, the bubble-generating and -removal equipment
may be put into a side stream rather than in the
main line of the fuel loop.

Xenon-135 poisoning calculations have been
made for the single-fluid MSBR reference design,
described in a preceding section, and include the
recirculating bubble concept described above. The
analytical model used is that of a well-stirred pot;
that is, the concentration of xenon dissolved in salt
and in the bubbles is taken to be constant around
the entite fuel loop. Figure 7.1 shows the effect of
the amount of helium bubble recirculation on '35Xe
poison fraction. The other variable parameter on
this plot is the average void percent of bubbles in

the fuel loop, which is almost exactly equal to the
average void percent in the core. Bubble surface
areas are computed for bubbles 0.020 in. in diam-
eter. Other constant parameters are as listed in the
figure legend. The graphite is taken to be uncoated

and has a diffusion coefficient for xenon of 10—3
ft2/hr at 1200°F (permeability for helium at room
temperature ~10~5 cm?/sec). From this plot, it
can be seen that the fraction of bubbles stripped
per loop cycle can be 10% or less before the back
pressure of xenon in the bubble starts to signifi-
cantly reduce the stripping efficiency. This means
that for a given void fraction in the fuel salt, the
bubbles can be recirculated ten times before they
must be removed, and the capacity of the gas
system will be ¥ of that if all bubbles are re-
placed per cycle. As pointed out in the previous
semiannual report, the mass transfer coefficient to
circulating bubbles is one of the least-known pa-
rameters in this calculation.

A literature survey and analysis has been made?
on the expected mass transfer coefficient to the
bubbles in a turbulent stream. For the rigid inter-
face model the expected value will be about 2.0
ft/hr and for the mobile interface model the ex-
pected value will be about 13.0 ft/hr. The above
plot was computed using a value of 2,0 ft/hr. It is
unlikely that a completely mobile interface will

exist with these very small bubbles, but a partially
mobile interface may be realized. Now in these
calculations, the variables ‘‘bubble surface area’’
and ‘‘bubble mass transfer coefficient’’ always ap-
pear as a product. Figure 7.1 can then be used to
estimate the effect of a change in the mass transfer
coefficient. In this plot the average void percent
bubbles in the fuel is used only to generate a sur-
face area of 20-mil-diam bubbles and otherwise is a
negligible parameter if the bubbles are far from sat-
uration. The bubbles do not approach saturation
until the fraction of bubbles stripped from the loop
per cycle is less than 5%. Therefore, in the
straight-line section of these curves, doubling the
surface area is the same as doubling the mass
transfer coefficient. For example, if the mass
transfer coefficient is doubled for the case where
the bubble surface area is 9430 ft?, the poison frac-
tion would be reduced from 1.9% to 1.25% for the
10% bubble stripping fraction. It should also be
noted that for a given void fraction, the bubble sur-
face area is reduced by a factor of 2 if the bubble
diameter is doubled.

Figure 7.2 shows the effect of a very low perme-,
ability coating on the bulk graphite. This is en-
visioned as a sealant of pyrolytic graphite, or pos-
sibly metal, that plugs the surface pores of the bulk

were chosen from Fig. 7.1 to yield a high poison
fraction (~1.9%). With these parameters the calcu-
lations were repeated to obtain the effects of the
permeability and thickness of the sealed layer on
the poison fraction. In this calculation it was as-
sumed that the void fraction in graphite available to
xenon decreased by one order of magnitude when
the permeability decreased by two orders of magni-
tude. It can be seen that permeabilities of 107
and less are quite good in reducing the poison frac-
tion.

The target 135Xe poison fraction in the MSBR is
0.5% or less. With circulating bubbles alone (Fig.
7.1), this may or may not be attainable. Some of
the uncertainties are the bubble mass transfer coef-
ficient, the ability to generate uniformly 0.020-in.
bubbles, and the ability of the bubbles to maintain
their identity for many circuits around the fuel loop
(e.g., not agglomerate or migrate to a surface). If,
however, the circulating bubbles are assisted by
sealed graphite, the target poison fraction can be
achieved and surpassed.

7.2 BUBBLE GENERATOR
R. J. Kedl

Circulating helium bubbles with the fuel salt is
the preferred method of stripping noble gases gen-
erated by fission in the MSBR. Xenon-135 poison-
ing calculations reported above are based on sur-
face areas generated by bubbles 0.020 in. in diam-
eter. We have conducted exploratory tests with
water and air for some time to try to generate bub-
bles of this diameter with equipment that can be
scaled up to sizes adequate for the MSBR. In gen-
eral, two avenues of approach have been taken: (1)
mechanically powered generators, where a mixture
of air and water is fed to a mechanically agitating
geometry that breaks up the large bubbles into very
small ones; and (2) fluid-powered generators,
where, for example, air is injected into the throat
of a venturi. Without going into details of the sev-
eral models tested, the following conclusions have
been reached,

1. Emphasis on mechanically powered generators
should be reduced. During the early development
work, smaller and more uniformly sized bubbles
were attained by this method than with fluid-
powered generators; however, other potential prob-
lems would be considerable, For instance, a me-

74

chanical drive motor would be needed, but a sep-
arate drive motor would be undesirable. The most
logical place to install a mechanical generator
would be on the impeller of the pump. This com-
plicates an already critical item; furthermore, esti-
mates indicate that the most successful generator
model tested would cavitate in MSBR-scaled equip-
ment. A great deal of development work would be
needed to successfully attach a mechanical bubble
generator to a pump impeller.

2. Emphasis on the fluid-powered generator
should be increased. The most successful fluid-
powered bubble generator we have run is a venturi
modified so that gas is injected into small holes in
the throat and turbulence in the diffuser region gen-
erates the bubbles. Quantitative information is not
yet available; however, the bubbles appear to be
larger than desired — in the order of 50 mils. Itis
hoped that further experimentation will reduce this.
The venturi has the additional advantage that it
could serve as the helium pump if it were placed on
the suction side of the fuel pump.

7.3 BUBBLE SEPARATOR
R. J. Kedl

Work is under way on the development of a pipe-
line bubble separator for the removal of noble-gas-
rich bubbles from the fuel salt. The separator is a
straight section of 4-in. pipe about 4 ft long with
swirl vanes at the inlet end and recovery vanes at
the outlet. The swirling fluid generates a high
gravitational field in the pipe, and circulating bub-
bles will migrate to a gas-filled vortex in the center
of the pipe. The recovery vanes straighten out the
fluid and recover some of its energy. The gas take-
off is in the hub of the recovery vanes.

A full-scale model has been built and is operating
in an existing water loop. A photograph of the sep-
arator operating in a Plexiglas pipe is shown in
Fig. 7.3. Two sets of swirl vanes have been
tested. The second set operates better than the
first, and the results of this set only will be re-
ported. Velocity profiles were measured in a radial
direction and are shown in Fig., 7.4. Axial and
tangential components are very nearly the same and
are shown as a single line. It was also noted that
there was very little attenuation of the velocity
over the 27 -ft length between the vanes. At 660
gpm the following pressure distributions were ob-
served:

The only problem encountered is that the vortex
does not attach to the hub of the recovery vanes. It
can be seen in the photograph that the vortex seems
to disintegrate just ahead of the recovery vanes,
and any bubbles entering this area are swept on
past the hub. In earlier work done on pipeline gas
separators? this phenomenon had not been experi-
enced. The trouble is probably due to the hub size.
It is planned to make a new set of vanes with the
hub diameter doubled, which will be more in accord-
ance with the separator of the earlier work.

sporadic fashion until June 28, 1968. Accumulated
circulation time was 947 hr, most of which was
spent in obtaining pump performance and cavitation
data for comparison with predicted values. Several
of the cavitation tests resulted in ‘“‘ingassing’’
transients, where the expansion of the salt due to
gas entrainment was sufficient to cause expulsion
of salt into the gas lines.

Most of the downtime was due to removal and re-
placement of the pump rotary element and to correc-
tion of gas-system plugging problems. The balance
of the noncirculating time was spent on gas-system
revisions, instrument calibrations, and correction of
routine problems. The pump rotary element was re-
moved because a material balance on the lube oil
system indicated the possibility of a large oil leak.
No evidence of a leak was found, and the trouble
was subsequently ascribed to shifting of inventory
between the oil storage tank and the pump bearing
cavity.

During July the flushing salt was removed from
the system, and a new batch of NaBF4 was charged
into the system. Net weights transferred were as
follows:

Flushing salt originally charged into sump 692 Ib
Flushing salt removed from sump 702 1b
New salt charged into sump 765 1b

The new charge of salt was added to the system in
four batches. In order to remove adsorbed moisture,
each batch was heated to 300°F and maintained
under a vacuum (27 in. Hg) for at least 16 hr. The
material was then heated to 1040°F and, if gas re-
lease as measured by a pressure rise determination
was not excessive, transfer was made to the loop
sump. Table 7.1 summarizes the data for this oper-
ation.

The loop was recharged with the new batch of
salt, and circulation was resumed on August 19,
1968. Test progress as of the end of August was
as follows.

7.4.1 Pumping Characteristics of Sodium
Fluoroborate Salt

The head-flow-speed characteristics of the PK
pump checked quite well with previous performance
data obtained with NaK, as indicated in Fig. 7.5.
Cavitation inception tests were made while circu-
lating the flushing salt at temperatures of 900,
1025, 1150, and 1275°F, with flow at 750 gpm and

76

speed at 1800 rpm. These tests are now being re-
peated with the new charge of salt. In a cavitation
test the flow and temperature are held constant, and
the gas pressure in the pump gas space is lowered
in steps until there is a disproportionate drop in
pump discharge pressure per unit drop in pump suc-
tion pressure. For the flushing salt, the test re-
sults gave values for the minimum overpressure

what higher than the predicted values. Also, the
change in minimum overpressure as a function of
salt temperature did not agree with the change in
BF3 dissociation pressure as calculated from the
equation

log P (mm) = 9.024 — (5920/T°K) (ref. 1),

Cavitation tests with the new charge of salt are
still in progress, but preliminary results are show-
ing good agreement between predicted and test
values for both the pressure at cavitation inception
and the change of cavitation pressure with tempera-
ture. The lack of agreement in the case of the
flushing salt may have been due to the higher level
of impurities. The ingassing transients which have
occurred during the cavitation tests are thought to
be due to operating characteristics peculiar to the
PK pump, and hence should have no particular im-
plication for the MSRE and MSBR systems.

7.4.2 Restrictions in the Gas System

Analytical investigations are under way to iden-
tify the nature and source of all materials which
have caused plugging problems. Aside from the
predictable salt plugs caused by ingassing tran-
sients, difficulties with gas system restrictions
were traced to three different materials.

(1) Accumulations of fluid, brown to black in
color and watery to syrupy in consistency, have
been found in the off-gas line. This material ap-
pears to be a BF , hydrolysis product, possibly due
to moisture present in the loop at startup or brought
in with the salt. Pressure-rise data during pretreat-
ment (Table 7.1) indicate that the new salt may
have contained trace quantities of a volatile con-
taminant. The total amount of material has been
relatively small (<100 cm3), and the rate of accum-
ulation appears to be decreasing with time.

(2) Plugs have occurred due to formation of a

where the BF -helium mixture is vented into the
stack (Fig. 7.6). This material, which appears to
be boric or fluoroboric acid resulting from reaction
of BF _ with atmospheric moisture, is corrosive as
well as plug-forming. The implication is that a
chemical system will be needed for disposal of BF |
at the MSRE.

(3) Deposits of a fine black powder have been
found in both the off-gas line and gas feed lines.
This material appears to be amorphous carbon
which collects as a scum on the surface of the salt
in the pump bowl and is carried into the gas lines
during ingassing transients. The source of the
carbon is not clear, but there seems to be no direct
relation to the NaBF, salt.

7.4.3 Salt Compatibility

When the pump was opened to check for oil leak-
age, pieces of green salt were found in the upper
region of the pump bowl. The composition of the
salt together with that of NaBF and the BULT-4
salt previously used in the loop are shown in Table
7.2. The significance of the green salt deposit has
not as yet been determined, but there seems to be
no adverse implication for the MSRE coolant sys-
tem, since the latter does not contain the two con-

78

stituents, U and Th, which appear to have ‘‘salted
out.”’

7.4.4 NuBF4 Freeze Valve

Performance of the drain-line freeze valve has
been satisfactory through eight freeze and seven
thaw cycles. This valve had been altered to simu-
late the characteristics of the MSRE-type valve.
The preliminary conclusion is that, except for
freezing at a lower temperature, the freeze valves
in the drain line of the MSRE coolant system will
operate about the same with the fluoroborate salt as
they do with the present LiF-BeF2 coolant salt.

the Molten-Salt Breeder Experiment. This philos-
ophy included the following five main points:

1. Industry will design and build the prototypes
of the fuel-salt and coolant-salt pumps for the
MSBE. They will modify these designs on the
basis of test results and will build the pumps for
the Engineering Test Unit and the MSBE. All the
pumps will be built to ORNL specifications.

2. Industry will do any development of pump
parts, such as rotary seals and bearings, that they
believe to be necessary and that can be done with-
out facilities for handling large amounts of molten
salts.

3. All the pumps will be tested in a molten-salt
facility that will be built and operated with govern-
ment funds. Engineers from the manufacturers of
the pumps will be required to participate in this
testing, and engineers from other pump and equip-
ment manufacturers will be invited to participate.

4. The pumps will be operated in the ETU and
the MSBE. Engineers from the manufacturers of the
pumps will be required to participate in tests of the
pumps in these two facilities. Engineers from other
pump and equipment manufacturers will be invited
to participate.

5. ORNL will continue the design studies of
pumps for molten-salt reactors to assist in our over-
all reactor design studies and to maintain the com-
petence necessary to monitor the work done by in-
dustry and to approve their designs for our use. We
will also continue to test critical pump parts such
as bearings and seals and to work on the develop-
ment of molten-salt bearings and bearing materials
for use in molten-salt reactor systems.

We are now engaged in implementing the manage-
ment plan for obtaining MSBE salt pumps.

1. Some preliminary studies of capacity, head re-
quirements, net positive suction head (NPSH) re-
quirements, operation of pumps in parallel, pump
tank volume requirements, critical shaft speeds,
etc., have been made, and such studies will con-
tinue.

2. The first rough draft of specifications for the
MSBE fuel-salt pump has been circulated internally
for comments, and currently these comments are
being incorporated into a second draft.

3. A request for proposal is being written. This
document will accompany the pump specification
and will invite pump manufacturers to submit pro-
posals and will outline the total scope of the work
and detail the information to be supplied in their
proposals.

4. A five-member proposal evaluation team will
be selected, some members of which will be from
the Purchasing Division and some from the Reactor
Division,

The pump contract will probably be of the cost-
plus-fixed-fee type, and procurement will be in
three phases. Phase I will be the design of the
pump and will include:

1. Design concept and layout drawings.

2. Parametric study of speed, efficiency, volume,
and NPSH, from which the design speed will be se-
lected with ORNL approval.

3. All calculations, analyses, computer programs,
etc., establishing that the final design complies
with all requirements.

4. Complete set of detail drawings.

5. Cost estimates, schedules for phase II, and
conceptual drawings of all test facilities required.

6. Phase I will also include instigation of a pro-
gram of incipient failure detection for the purpose
of reducing the possibility of a sudden pump stop-
page and to give the reactor operating personnel an
advance warning of impending pump failure or mal-
function.

Phase II will then be the actual fabrication of the
prototype pump by the manufacturer. It will include
designing and fabricating all test facilities, per-
forming any component tests not requiring a large
molten-salt system, performing stress-strain tests
of any member or configurations not suitable for
rigorous analysis, providing any special tools such
as those for remote maintenance, testing all aux-
iliary systems such as the lube oil system, motor-
cooling system, etc. Phase II includes testing the
prototype pump on water, then disassembling the
pump and checking for signs of rubbing or symptoms
of any malfunction, taking corrective action, and re-
testing.

The prototype pump will then be tested in a
molten-salt test facility planned for construction at
ORNL. The facility will be operated by ORNL per-
sonnel, but the participation of the pump manufac-
turer will be required. In addition, other pump man-
ufacturers will be invited to participate in all
phases of this test. Preliminary design of a molten-
salt pump test facility is now under way (see Sect.
7.5.4). The one facility will be designed to accom-
modate the MSBE fuel and coolant pumps. Start of
testing of the prototype MSBE fuel-salt pump in the
pump test facility is currently approximately sched-
uled for fiscal year 1972.
Phase III consists of producing the pumps re-
quired for the ETU and the MSBE and performing
proof tests of the pumps and auxiliary systems at
the seller’s facilities prior to running the pumps
with molten salt in the pump test facility.

The seller will furish field representatives to
work with ORNL personnel to install, test, and
operate the pumps in the molten-salt pump test fa-
cility, the ETU, and finally in the MSBE. Addi-
tional assistance will be required to disassemble,
reassemble, and diagnose and remedy pump prob-
lems. Engineers from other pump and equipment
manufacturers will also be invited to participate in
the tests and operation.

7.5.2 Fuel-Salt Pump

Although the head and flow requirements have
changed, as shown in Table 7.3, the basic concept
of the fuel-salt pump® has not changed significantly
from that shown in the last semiannual progress re-
port. Since the reactor vessel design is directly
affected by the NPSH required to suppress cavita-
tion, and since the fuel-salt inventory of the system
must be held down, a study was made of the effect
of pump speed on required NPSH and fuel-salt
volume within the pump. Calculations were made to

5MSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept, Feb. 29, 1968,
ORNL.-4254, pp. 76—78.

80

determine nominal dimensions of the impeller, vo-
lute, suction and discharge nozzles, and the min-
imum required NPSH to suppress cavitation. Pump
layouts were made from which the salt volumes
within the confines of the pump tank were calcu-
lated. The results are shown in Fig. 7.7. The im-
peller and pump tank diameters are shown to give
an idea of the relative pump sizes.

Some design details of the pump have been in-
vestigated further. Those surfaces of the pump
tank, its internal structural elements, and the pump
shaft that are not in contact with the molten salt
are subject to nuclear heating and will have to be
cooled. It is intended to bring fuel salt from the

reactor inlet plenum (at about 1050°F) and pass it
over all the heated surfaces before discharging it
into the pump tank. Salt from this source is pro-
vided as long as one of the four pumps is in opera-
tion.

A preliminary investigation was made of the
amount of shielding needed in the shield plug to
protect the lubricant and other radiation-sensitive
elements in the region of the bearing housing., Ap-
proximately 1 ft of Hastelloy N will limit the ac-
cumulated dosage at the lower seal to 108 rads in
several years, Additional shielding will be needed
to reduce the radiation level at the crane-bay floor
elevation for personnel access.

The pump layout is being modified to provide a
means for containing the lubricant within the bear-
ing housing assembly in the event of a gross seal
failure and thus prevent the leakage of lubricant
into the salt system.

A preliminary study has been made of the relation-
ship between shaft overhang length and shaft diam-
eter for a pump operating at 890 rpm with a shaft
critical speed of 1200 rpm. It was assumed that the
impeller weighed 1000 Ib, the bearing span was 24

sults, using a simplified relationship, are shown in
Fig. 7.8.

7.5.3 Coolant-Salt Pump

The similarity® of the fuel-salt and coolant-salt
pump requirements has led us to consider using the
same pump design for both applications. Differ-
ences in head requirements can be taken care of by
changing the outside diameter of the impeller. If
the head requirements differ greatly, the coolant-
salt pump can be operated at the next highest speed
available in induction motors, provided the shaft
critical speed has been designed sufficiently high.
It may be necessary to design the coolant-salt pump
tank for a higher pressure, but this is compensated
for by its lower normal operating temperature of
1150°F. The coolant-salt pump tank would not re-
quire any provisions for the removal of nuclear
heating, but it would require a larger volume for
salt expansion, largely due to the greater inventory
in the coolant salt system.

7.5.4 Molten-Salt Pump Test Facility

This facility is needed first to proof-test a proto-
type of the pump manufacturer’s design for the
MSBE fuel-salt pump in molten salt at the antici-
pated reactor operating conditions, excluding nu-
clear radiation. In addition, a total of six reactor
pumps, the fuel- and coolant-salt pumps for both
the ETU and the MSBE and two spare pumps for the
MSBE, will be given hot shakedown tests in the fa-
cility., Endurance testing of MSBE pumps will also
be conducted. This facility will be capable of test-
ing devices for removal of xenon from the salt by
contact with an inert gas, of investigating unantici-
pated problems that may arise during the operation
of the ETU and MSBE, and of proof-testing MSBE
instrumentation such as pressure, flow, and liquid-
level measuring devices when they are available.

The fuel- and coolant-salt pumps will be operated
in the facility with one (barren fuel) salt, as was
the philosophy for proof-testing the MSRE pumps.
This is possible even though the density of the fuel
salt is greater than the coolant salt, and the coolant
salt head and flow rate requirements may be higher

6MSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Feb, 29, 1968,
ORNL-4254, p. 78.
than those for the fuel salt. It may be accom-
plished by modifying such parameters as speed and
pump tank gas pressure and by using a reduced di-
ameter of the pump impeller. Thus, overloading the
pump drive and overpressuring the facility piping
can be avoided.

The useful operating life of the facility is esti-
mated to be more than five years. It is proposed to
locate the facility in Building 9201-3 at Y-12.

Design. — Criteria for the facility have been
evolving during the past several months and are be-
lieved to be firm at present. The design of the test
facility will be influenced by the requirements of
the MSBE; since these are not firmly established, a
reasonable amount of flexibility and overdesign
have been provided in the criteria for the test fa-
cility. The facility is being designed on the basis
of a 200-Mw (thermal) MSBE system having one fuel
and one coolant-salt pump with a AT of 300°F in
both salt circuits. The design conditions for the
pumps are shown in Table 7.3,

The test facility will have a maximum pump motor
capability of 1500 hp and salt flow capability of

82

150% of design conditions. Hastelloy N will be
used to fabricate all salt-containing piping and
equipment,

Preliminary design of the test facility has been
completed. Basically, the facility will consist of
the necessary salt piping system, salt-to-air heat
removal system, salt flow restrictors, salt flow
measuring venturi, preheaters for the salt-contain-
ing parts, and necessary controls and instrumenta-
tion. The flow diagram is shown in Fig. 7.9. Pro-
visions will be made to supply electric power to
constant-speed or variable-speed motors up to 1500
hp in size. The necessary cover and vent gas
system for the pump and salt storage tank will be
provided.

Two fixed flow restrictors and a variable flow re-
strictor will be used to simulate the pressure drops
expected in the MSBE heat exchanger and reactor
vessel. The variable flow restrictor, a modified
throttling valve used successfully for many years
in salt-pump test loops, will be used to vary the
loop pressure drop up to 100 psi. This throttling
valve will permit the measuring of the head vs flow

ditions. In addition, this throttling valve may be
used to compensate partially for possible changes
in the MSBE pump requirements.

The heat removal system is sized to remove all
energy transmitted to the circulating salt stream by
a 1500-hp pump motor. Design studies indicate that
two 14-ft-long concentric pipe heat exchangers
using 5000 cfm of air at 5 psig supplied to each
heat exchanger will dissipate the pumping energy.
Positive displacement blowers, to be located out-
side the building, will supply the cooling air to the
1.12-Mw heat removal system.

The loop piping, complete with pump, will contain
approximately 200 ft3® of salt. Piping in most of the
loop will be 12 in. ID with a 374-in. wall. A venturi
will be provided to measure salt flows of 3000 to
7000 gpm., A 11/2-in. pipe-size freeze valve, iden-
tical to the MSRE freeze valve, will be used in the
pipeline connecting the salt storage tank to the
loop piping.

Provisions will be made to electrically preheat
all the salt-containing piping and equipment to
1200°F.

The cost of the facility is being estimated on the
basis of the preliminary design, and a request for
authorization of the facility is being prepared.

7.5.5 Rotor-Dynamics Feasibility Study

The final report,” Feasibility Study of Rotor-
Bearing System Dynamics for a 1250 HP Molten
Salt Fuel Pump, has been received from Mechanical
Technology Incorporated. The scope of the study
was to investigate (1) the rotor dynamics of a long-
shaft (approximately 32 ft) fuel-salt pump for the
two-fluid reactor system, (2) the type and character-
istics of a molten-salt-lubricated bearing at the
lower end of the pump shaft, and (3) the shaft seal
configuration and its characteristics.

The shaft and rotor system critical speeds were
determined for two pump shafts of different diam-
eter configurations each approximately 32 ft long:
(1) 9 in. OD by 81/4 in. ID, and (2) 7.5 in. OD by
6.5 in. ID. The dynamic response of the larger-
diameter shaft was computed in terms of frequency
and displacement amplitudes for both the trans-
verse and torsional modes of vibration for the mass

unbalance condition provided by a uniformly bowed
shaft, The same computations were made for the
smaller-diameter shaft for two mass unbalance con-
ditions, (1) shaft OD and ID surfaces uniformly ec-
centric, and (2) shaft uniformly bowed.

The first shaft critical speeds obtained by com-
puter unbalance response programs for both the
large- and small-diameter shafts were lower than
the design pump speed of 1200 rpm and were 700
rpm and 560 rpm respectively. The study indicated
that the second shaft critical speed for the large-
diameter shaft is substantially above 1200 rpm and
about 25% above that for the small-diameter shaft.

The acceleration and deceleration of both shafts
through the first shaft critical speed are rendered
hazardous because the imposed location of the
molten-salt dampers near the lower shaft bearing
reduces their effectiveness. The optimum damper
location is near the midlength of the shaft between
bearings.

A certain amount of shaft bowing and eccentricity
between the shaft outer and inner diameters attrib-
utable to manufacturing practices can be accommo-
dated. Computations indicated that values of ap-
proximately 0.025 in. of bow in the middle of a uni-
formly bowed shaft or of approximately 0.019 in.
eccentricity in a uniformly eccentric shaft could be
accommodated singly at the shaft critical speed.
The values are limited by bearing eccentricity; a
value of 0.95 was used in the computations, which
means that the journal and bearing surfaces are
very close to rubbing,

The transverse and torsional vibrational charac-
teristics of the inner and outer pump casings were
computed, and account was taken for the inertia of
the drive motor. The results indicated the need to
increase the stiffness of the outer pump casing to
avoid a resonance at the pump design speed of 1200
rpm. To raise the first torsional critical speed to
at least 30% greater than the design speed requires
increasing the thickness of the outer casing to 1 in.

A comparison of hydrodynamic (self-acting) and
hydrostatic (externally pumped) film lubrication for
the lower shaft, molten-salt-lubricated bearing
favored the former. The relatively high viscosity
of molten salt provides excellent load capacity and
also hydrodynamic film operation in the laminar re-
gime. The inherent simplicity of the self-acting
bearing contrasted favorably with the complications
required for hydrostatic lubrication, which includes
the necessity to develop high lubricant heads and
to maintain reliable operation of a number of com-
pensating orifices and pressure reducing lands.
84

Of the many types of self-acting bearings con-
sidered, the tilting (pivoted) pad bearing design
having four pads was selected, as it is by far the
most stable bearing available. It should be totally
free of instability when properly designed to have
adequate preloading, optimum pivot location, and
low-inertia pads. It is strongly recommended for
flexible shaft applications where the speed may
exceed twice the first shaft critical.

A seal configuration using gas-lubricated face
seals was studied, and computations were made of
the gas film lifting force, thickness and stiffness,
and the gas-leaking flow rates. Some calculations
were made of seal bellows loading requirements
and face tracking,

The principal recommendation of the report was
to design the pump shaft to operate subcritically;
that is, the design pump speed should be lower than
the first shaft critical speed rather than above the
critical speed, as required by the flexible shaft
studied. Subcritical operation would reduce, if not
eliminate, the probability of low-speed high-ampli-
tude whirl. It would eliminate the large unbalance
response amplitudes associated with traversing the
first shaft critical speed. The most practical way
to achieve subcritical design would be to reduce
shaft length, or shaft speed, or both.

If supercritical speed operation is required, the
principal other recommendations were: (1) develop
a practical means of dynamic shaft balancing, and
(2) build a rotor-dynamic evaluation simulator. The
simulator is not a computer program, but rather a
full-scale model of the pump rotor-dynamic system
to evaluate its dynamic response experimentally. A
reduced-scale model would probably permit a valid
evaluation if tilting-pad bearings were used.

A bearing materials program was recommended
and outlined.

Since the present design of a one-fluid MSBR
makes use of a pump with a much shorter shaft that
can be designed to operate at speeds below the
first shaft critical speed, there are no plans for ad-
ditional studies of the long-shaft pump.

7.5.6 Molten-Salt Bearing Program

Because of the increased emphasis on the single-
fluid reactor concept and the use of the short-shaft
pump configuration for the salt circuits, the molten-
salt bearing program® has been temporarily cur-
tailed.

The molten-salt testing of the bearing material
specimens supplied by Mechanical Technology In-
corporated will be held in abeyance. The testing
will be resumed should a renewed interest in the
use of molten-salt bearings develop.

The Metals and Ceramics Division continued its
investigation of the hard-coated specimens. The
composition of each of the coatings was determined
by x-ray diffraction. Themmal cycle tests will be
performed on these specimens in a gaseous atmos-
phere, and then they will be reexamined by x-ray
diffraction. This will conclude the present plans
for investigating bearing materials.

The design work on the molten-salt bearing tester
for testing relatively large molten-salt bearings
was stopped upon completion of the layout of the
tester.

7.6 MOLTEN-SALT STEAM GENERATOR

E. J. Breeding R. E. Helms

The molten-salt steam generator is a vital sec-
ondary system component required for the success-
ful operation of molten-salt power breeder reactors.
The development of an economical, reliable steam
generator will require the combined efforts of ORNL
and commercial designers and fabricators of high-
pressure and -temperature steam generators. Our
plans include developing steam generators for the
MSBE with maximum industrial involvement.

A supercritical steam cycle has been selected for
the MSBE and the MSBR. The choice of supercrit-
ical steam was influenced by the choice of sodium
fluoroborate (NaBF4-NaF, 92-8 mole %) as the fluid
for the secondary coolant system. Using a super-
critical steam cycle, it is feasible to provide feed-
water to the steam generator at approximately the
same temperature as the melting point of the sec-
ondary coolant, thus reducing the possibility of
freezing the coolant salt.

ORNL will specify the design criteria and param-
eters of the sodium fluoroborate coolant salt system
and the steam generator system for the MSBE. We
will prepare a scope and plan of action for the de-
velopment of the steam generator and write the
specifications. Industry will do both title I and
title II designs and will fabricate the steam gen-

ORNL-4254, pp. 79-81.
'y

erator for the MSBE, with the final test and evalu-
ation of the steam generator being made in the
MSBE.

To provide ORNL and interested industrial par-
ticipants with the technological background to de-
sign the MSBE steam generator, ORNL will design,
construct, and operate a full-scale tube test facility
to obtain heat transfer, fluid flow, and operational
stability data, Components for this facility will be
procured from industrial suppliers to provide some
experience in fabricating Hastelloy N material com-
ponents for the MSBE and future MSBR’s. Industry
will be invited to participate in the operation of the
facility during tests of full-scale tubes representa-
tive of MSBE steam generator designs. The test
data obtained in the operation of this facility will
be used to validate a computer program that will be
used to design and analyze both the MSBE steam
generator and larger units for the molten-salt
breeder reactors.

We have produced a rough draft of a conceptual
design of a facility for testing full-scale tubes for
molten-salt steam generators., This facility has a
sodium fluoroborate coolant salt system, space for
a full-scale tube test section, and a steam system
that can operate at supercritical steam conditions.
The design will provide for startup, subcritical, and
supercritical operating conditions. The heat rating
and design parameters for the test section ate given
in Table 7.4.

Table 7.5 shows the proposed interrelation of
ORNL and commercial participation in the MSBE
steam generator development program.

We are now preparing cost estimates for the full-
scale tube test facility prior to initiating requests
for programmatic approval, and work will begin soon
on preparation of MSBE steam generator criteria,
operating parameters, and specifications to be sub-
mitted to steam generator manufacturers.

We are planning a survey of available fluid-flow
computer programs applicable to molten-salt steam
generator design. Based on the results of this
sutvey, a preliminary computer program will be gen-

7.7 REMOTE WELDING

P. P. Holz

A program designed to establish the feasibility of
remotely cutting, bevelling, and welding pipe and
vessel closures in a radioactive environment was
begun. We evaluated the current status of the auto-
mated welding equipment technology? for applica-
tion to remote handling, operation, and monitoring.
We decided to investigate the necessary machinery
modifications to adapt a system to our require-
ments,

The system chosen was one developed for the Air
Force by North American—Rockwell. The system
originated in 1964 from a program to develop pro-
cedures and portable equipment for fabricating
rocket fluid systems by automatic fusion-welding
techniques. The North American Aviation Los
Angeles Division of North American—Rockwell Cor-
poration contracted to conduct a program for the de-
velopment of a system to permit (1) parting or sepa-
ration of piping, (2) machining of pipe ends to pre-
pare the proper weld joint configurations, (3)
welding of piping, and (4) automatic control of the
welding sequence and variables. The Air Force
equipment employs a single compact carriage unit
which is inserted over and attached to the pipe and
then carries an interchangeable cutter or welder
module about the pipe. A weld programmer and a
standard power source comprise the balance of the
equipment. We believe that the use of a single car-
riage for all phases of the cut and reweld operation
simplifies position indexing and assures precise
tool alignment, This should save on the time

weldment repairs may be required. The compact-
ness of this system is also desirable, it being

about 4 in. thick radially and about 10 1/2 in. long.

Considerable progress has been achieved over the
past four years in converting the concept to a piece
of reliable operational machinery. The Air Force
reports satisfactory cutting and welding results in
recent prototype equipment trials using a variety of
metals, including aluminum, Inconel, and stainless
steels.

We were fortunate in having the AEC obtain de-
sign documentation from the Air Force to permit us
to proceed to review and adapt the equipment for
our remote use in radioactive environments. We
prepared 26 detailed shop drawings and a specifi-
cation package for our prototype mechanical as-
sembly. Requests for purchase were issued, and
delivery is expected early in 1969. It is tentatively
planned to borrow a welding programmer unit from
the Air Force for our initial equipment trials.

The present machinery is designed for work on
piping only and is capable of preparing joints for

87

butt-welding and then performing the welds. We
have designed an alternate carriage for welding lip
seals. This carriage ‘‘walks’’ about a set of
mating contoured seal lips carrying the same cutter
or welder inserts used with the pipe design. Selec-
tion of motor propulsion equipment for this ‘‘seal-
joint’’ carriage was kept compatible with that of the
pipe cutter-welder carriage drive to permit operation
with the same system programmer and instrumenta-
tion.

Timely completion of the feasibility portion of the
weld development program now under way will per-
mit the use of cutting, bevel, and weld machinery in
the construction of future reactor facilities, includ-
ing the MSBE construction. Application and use of
the equipment in plant construction would be enor-
mously beneficial for several reasons: System re-
liability and quality control studies could be made
and the results compared with conventional inspec-
tion methods. Base information of the weld param-
eters could be recorded for future reference. Sub-
stantial construction time and cost savings could
result with the use of automated weld machinery.

8.1 CONTROL SYSTEM ANALYSES

W. H. Sides, ]Jr.
F. H. Clark

J. L. Anderson
O. W. Burke

The analysis of the dynamic response of the
MSBR system as it relates to the overall plant
control problem was continued. Two approaches
to the problem were taken concurrently. These
overlap somewhat but are in general complemen-
tary. The first was a series of studies aimed at
development of a satisfactory scheme for coupling
the power generation rate of the reactor to the re-
quirements of a variable electrical load. In these
studies the models of the major components were
necessarily very rough approximations. Although
the results are believed to be qualitatively correct,
no great significance should be attached to the de-
tailed numerical results. The second set of studies
was intended to study, in as detailed a manner as
was possible, the dynamic behavior of the steam
generator during load transients. Such a study will
permit better modeling of this portion of the system
for future analyses of the MSBR system as a whole.

8.1.1 System Control Analysis

Investigation was begun of the dynamics and
control of the single-fluid MSBR. This investiga-
tion has as its objective the development of a sat-
isfactory method of controlling the reactor power
and the system temperatures to satisfy the require-
ments of a power plant with variable load demand.
In the present study we are using a simulation
which will eventually include core kinetics (in-
cluding temperature-reactivity feedback and some
approximation of the effects introduced by circu-
lating the fuel), one primary salt loop, one sec-

88

ondary salt loop including a variable secondary
salt flow rate, and a control system. This simu-
lation is accomplished in four phases, three of
which have been completed.

In the first phase the steady-state temperature
profile of the system was investigated for various
power levels from 30 to 100% of full power. Using
the 100% power design temperature profile as a
starting point, the temperatures at the inlet and
outlet of the core, primary heat exchanger, and
steam generator were calculated for lower steady-
state powers. The flow rate of the secondary salt
was also included in the calculation. Steady-state
log-mean AT heat transfer and heat balance equa-
tions were used with the heat transfer coefficient
on the tube side of the exchangers taken to be
proportional to the 0.8 power of the tube-side flow
rate and on the shell side proportional to the 0.6
power of the shell-side flow rate.! The set of
steady-state equations required that several of the
variables be specified in order for a solution to be
obtained. In all the cases calculated here the tem-
peratures of the water entering and of the steam
leaving the steam generator were held constant at
700 and 1000°F respectively. The steady-state
pressures were assumed not to vary with power
level. With these assumptions the power ex-
tracted from the steam generator is directly pro-
portional to the mass flow rate of the steam. For
the 12 cases calculated, the temperatures and the
secondary-salt flow rate taken in various combina-
tions were specified, and the resulting system
temperature profiles were calculated for the various
power levels. Several cases were run in which a

secondary-salt valved or orificed by-pass line was
included in parallel with the steam generator.

The results showed, for example, that if the av-
erage reactor fuel temperature, as well as the
feedwater temperature and steam temperature, is
maintained constant, it may be difficult to main-
tain the secondary-salt temperature at the outlet
of the steam generator above its freezing point of
725°F at the lower power levels (~30%). The
case which produced the least variation in the
overall system temperature profile was one in
which the flow rate of the secondary salt was
held constant. For this case the primary-salt
inlet temperature to the reactor varied between
1000 and 950°F for power levels between 100
and 30%, the outlet temperature varied between
1300 and 1050°F, the secondary-salt hot leg
varied between 1150 and 1106°F, and the sec-
ondary-salt cold leg varied between 850 and 915°F.
We concluded that a control system arranged to
maintain the secondary-salt flow rate at its 100%
power value while allowing the primary- and
secondary-salt temperatures to vary with power
level should be included in those investigated
further in the studies of transient conditions.

The investigation of the transient conditions
employing the analog computer was begun in the
second phase. In this phase an analog program

89

was set up for the primary heat exchanger, the
steam generator, and the secondary-salt loop
with constant primary- and secondary-salt flow
rates. In this phase of the analog studies, as

in those which follow, a lumped system model
was used similar to that used in the analysis of
the MSRE? (see Fig. 8.1). The equations de-
scribing the system were not linearized, and the
latest values for the system parameters were em-
ployed. In this phase of the investigation, as
well as in those which follow, the objective of
the control system was to maintain the steam
temperature to within a few degrees of the de-
sign point value of 1000°F during a transient
condition initiated by a change in steam load
demand. This was accomplished by controlling
the temperature of the primary salt entering the
primary heat exchanger. The controller was ar-
ranged so that a 10°F error in steam temperature
would alter the primary-salt temperature at a rate
of 1°F/sec. With this arrangement a 10% step
decrease in power demand from 100% to 90% full
load yielded a maximum steam temperature vari-
ation of about 8°F (see Table 8.1). It took 100

sec for this temperature to return to within 1°F
of 1000°F. In a 20% step decrease in steam load
from 100% to 80% full load, the maximum steam
temperature variation was about 15°F. Again,
100 sec was required for the temperature to re-
turn to its design point.

Ramp changes in load demand at 5% and 10%/
min were introduced. The results are shown in
Table 8.1.

In order to decrease the 100 sec required to
return the steam temperature to its design point
after a step change in load, an attempt was made
to readjust the controller. Efforts here were un-
successful, however, as the system proved to be
It was therefore concluded that in order
to accomplish rapid steam temperature control the
secondary-salt flow rate must be variable during
a transient.

unstable.

The third phase of the study thus incorporated
control of the secondary-salt flow rate in the
system. The steam temperature controller was
arranged so that an error in steam temperature
altered the secondary-salt flow rate to bring the
steam temperature back to its design point. A
secondary controller slowly changed some tem-
perature (such as the temperature of the primary
salt entering the primary heat exchanger) to bring
the secondary-salt flow rate back to its design
point. As a starting point the steam temperature
controller was arranged so that a 1°F error in
steam temperature would produce a 10%/min
change in secondary-salt flow rate. The sec-
ondary-salt flow rate controller was arranged so
that a 1% change in this flow rate would produce
a 1°F/min change in the temperature of the pri-
mary salt entering the primary heat exchanger.
Using this conttol scheme a 10% step decrease
in steam load demand from 100% to 90% full load
produced a maximum steam temperature variation
of about 5°F. The steam temperature returned to
within 1°F of design point in about 30 sec as
compared with 100 sec above. The maximum
change in the secondary-salt flow rate was about
20%, from 100% to 80% of the design point. The
maximum rate of change was about 50%/min.

The flow rate returned to within 3% of its design
point in approximately 250 sec, or 4.2 min. This
required a maximum rate of change of the tempera-
ture of the primary salt entering the primary heat
exchanger of about 20°F/min with an ultimate
change of about 40°F.

91

A 10%/min and a 5%/min ramp decrease in
steam load demand from 100% to 90% full load
produced the results shown in Table 8.1.

An attempt was made to increase the speed of
response of the secondary-salt flow rate controller.
However, increases of a magnitude large enough
to produce a significantly faster response intro-
duced system instabilities.

The fourth and final phase of this series of
analog studies will include the reactor core ki-
netics and a lumped model of the core heat trans-
fer. Temperature reactivity feedbacks will be
included, and an approximation of the transport
lags introduced in the delayed-neutron precursor
equations due to the circulation of the fuel. The
secondary-salt flow rate controller will be used
to alter the reactivity in the core via the control
rods, given a change in secondary-salt flow rate.
Transient conditions will be initiated by varying
the steam load demand in a manner similar to that
described above.

These studies are not intended to establish ab-
solute values for the dynamic response of the sys-
tem. They are of an exploratory nature for the
comparison of control system concepts. No at-
tempt has been made at this stage to ascertain
the effects of the rates of change of temperatures
or of flow rates calculated here on the components
of the proposed MSBR system. Further informa-
tion concerning the system components will be
needed in order to establish detailed control
system performance requirements.

8.1.2 Dynamic Analysis of MSBR Steam

Generators

The MSBR steam generator operates in the super-
critical water region. From inlet to outlet there is
a change in density of about a factor of 7; the heat
transfer coefficient of the film shows considerable
variation; the temperature changes in no simple way
with enthalpy input; further, it is a once-through
system. These characteristics not only present un-
usual opportunities for instabilities, but they make
invalid many of the simplifying assumptions used
in the analysis of conventional systems. We are
unable to assume two distinct incompressible
fluids, as is frequently done. Neither can we treat

simply defined heat capacities for water and steam
and a latent heat of evaporation. We are forced to
a more fundamental consideration of incompressible
flow with only a few simplifications. We describe

tions for water; 4 and 5, the energy conservation
equations for metal and salt; 6 and 7, the equations
of state of water; and 8, a definition. In addition,
the effect of the throttle is incorporated as a
boundary condition.

Complex as this description is, it contains a
large number of simplifications: for example,
neglect of gravitational potential energy, of bulk
kinetic energy, representation of friction by a
simple v2 term, and many others. Even so, when
an attempt was made to solve this set of equations
at the Instrumentation and Controls analog computer
facility last year, it was found that the problem ex-
ceeded the capability of the system. Consequently,
the problem was stripped down to much less ambi-
tious proportions and addressed again, this time
successfully.

The major restrictive simplifications were: (1)
the system was linearized, and (2) a single-tube
system was modeled. (A subcontract has been
let to the University of Illinois to develop a pro-
gram for their hybrid computer which will be free
of these restrictions. A hybrid computer is con-
sidered to be essential to a full analysis of the
problem.) The main effects of these restrictions
are as follows: (1) Instabilities due to parallel
channel effects cannot be studied. (2) Dynamic
studies are limited to a small range about a
steady-state condition. Steady-state control
problems can therefore be studied along with
linear stability. However, one cannot study con-
trol problems related to large changes in power
level, nonlinear stability, or accidents.

Two classes of studies were undertaken: open-
loop diagnostics and closed-loop control. In the
first class the system was operated entirely as
an open loop at steady state. A perturbation was
introduced into some input quantity to the steam
generator (inlet water pressure or temperature,
throttle setting, inlet salt temperature, or salt
velocity), and the effects on certain output quan-
tities (outlet water pressure and temperature, heat
L2

rate, mass flow, outlet salt temperature) were ob-
served. We consider the information so obtained
to be useful for system modeling with abbreviated
versions of the steam generator.

In the closed-loop studies we sought to find a
control scheme consistent with the following re-
quirements. Heat output should closely follow a

heat demand signal no more stringent than a linear

demand of 5% in 1 min. The water outlet tempera-

ture should remain within a 1°F band and the outlet

pressure within a band of a few pounds per square
inch.

A heat rate and heat demand comparison signal
was generated to control the heat output through
the throttle setting. Outlet water pressure was
controlled by causing an error signal to directly
alter the inlet water pressure. We attempted to
control the outlet water temperature by having an
error signal vary the inlet salt temperature to the
steam generator. However, when time lags were

inserted which reasonably approximated the delays
in the core and primary heat exchanger, the system

tended toward instability, and the limit to a 1°F
band simply could not be met. Since the salt ve-
locity (and therefore the heat transfer coefficient
from salt to steam generator) can respond to an
error signal with very little lag, a two-stage con-
troller was devised. The outlet water temperature
error signal was used to modify the salt velocity
for prompt control. The salt velocity then gen-
erated an error which was sent, lagged, to the
salt inlet temperature. The salt inlet temperature
then slowly replaced the salt velocity as the con-
trolling mechanism, and the salt velocity returned
to its steady-state value.

In view of the lack of a very firm system or com-
ponent design and of the necessary crudeness of
the model, no attempt was made to design an ex-
haustive or a refined control system. Rather we
sought, and we believe we obtained, an outline
scheme of feasible controls consistent with the
system as we now understand it. A report de-
scribing this work is in preparation.

8.2 CALCULATIONS OF NEUTRON DECAY
AFTER SHUTDOWN

W. H. Sides, Jr.

A calculation has been made of the neutron
density, n(t), in neutrons/cm?® as a function of
time after the insertion of various steps of nega-
tive reactivity. A program written for the IBM

360/75 includes six delayed neutron groups and
the effect of circulating fuel for both 233U and
235U, A simplification of the circulating fuel
kinetics equations of Meghreblian and Holmes*
was used. A similar calculation made from the
circulating fuel point kinetics equations of Mc-
Phee® yielded quite comparable results. An
analog simulation of a two delayed group approxi-
mation of McPhee’s equations also was in good
agreement. The equations used in these calcula-
tions do not include temperature effects or heat
generation from soutces other than those directly
proportional to neutron density.

Five cases were calculated for each of the two

uranium isotopes, including negative reactivity
steps of 0.002, 0.004, 0.006, 0.008, and 0.010.
In all cases the transit time of the fuel through
the core was 2.2 sec. The fuel in the loop ex-
ternal to the core had a transit time of 6.5 sec.
The neutron generation time was taken as 3.6 x
10—* sec.

For 233U, at the end of 1 sec the relative neu-
tron density, n(t)no, varied between 0.26 for the
—~0.002 step to 0.06 for the —0.010 step (see
Fig. 8.2). At the end of 70 sec the neutron den-
sity was between 0.025 and 0.004 for the two re-
activity steps. In the case of 35U the neutron
density varied between 0.45 and 0.13 at the end
of 1 sec for reactivity insertions between —0.002
and —0.010 respectively. At the end of 70 sec
the variation was between 0.043 and 0.007 for
these insertions.

The integral of the relative neutron density
with respect to time after reactivity insertion
was also calculated. The results are given in
megawatt-seconds per initial steady-state mega-
watt (for that fraction of the thermal power which
is proportional to neutron density). The calcula-
tion shows that for 233U, 0.37 Mw-sec per initial
Mw has been accumulated at the end of 1 sec
after a reactivity insertion of —0.002 (see Fig.
8.3). For insertion of —0.010 this value reduces
to 0.10 at the end of 1 sec. At the end of 70 sec
the levels resulting from these reactivity inser-
tions are 5.10 and 1.06 respectively. In the case
of 235U the levels are increased to 0.53 and 0.18
at the end of 1 sec and 8.93 and 1.94 at the end
of 70 sec for insertions of —0.002 and —0.010
respectively.

8.3 HIGH-TEMPERATURE RESISTANCE
THERMOMETER EVALUATION

R. L. Moore T. M. Cate

Investigation of the feasibility of measuring
high temperatures in molten-salt systems with
resistance thermometers has been resumed on a
small scale.

The use of resistance thermometers is primarily
of interest to the MSRP in reactor, engineering
test loop, and research experiment applications
that require measurement of small temperature
differences at high temperature. Precise meas-
urement of certain selected temperatures may also
be of interest. At intervals, attempts have been
made at ORNL to develop or purchase suitable
sensing devices for such applications.®'7 Al-
though these attempts have been only partially
successful, interest in the use of resistance

thermometers for high-temperature measurements
has continued.

Recently several companies (Electric Ther-
mometers Inc., Rosemount Engineering Company,
Leeds and Northrup) have marketed platinum re-
sistance thermometers that are rated for operation
at and above 1200°F and are reasonably priced.
One company (Electric Thermometers Inc.) offers
a ceramic-insulated platinum resistance ther-
mometer which is rated for operation up to 1560°F
(850°C) and claims that, when operated within
rating and properly installed, the thermometer
calibration will remain stable for long periods
at high temperature and will not be affected by
low-frequency cycling of the temperature. Two
sets of these thermometers were purchased for
test and evaluation. One set consists of a
matched pair of thermometers. The other set
consists of two ‘‘off-the-shelf’’ thermometers
having the manufacturers’ standard calibration.

*
Three test phases are planned. In the first
phase the thermometers will be tested for gross
shifts in calibration under conditions of prolonged
operation at high temperatures with occasional
wide variations of operating temperature, includ-
ing return to room temperature. In the second
phase a more accurate determination of high-
temperature calibration and calibration drift rate
will be made with one set. In the third phase the
other set will be installed in an operating molten-
salt test loop to obtain data on long-term perfor-
mance under field conditions. Phase 3 may be
performed concurrently with phase 2. Phase 2
and 3 tests will not be performed unless the re-
sults of phase 1 are satisfactory.

Phase 1 tests are in progress and nearing com-
pletion. In these tests two resistance thermometer
elements were connected in a differential bridge
arrangement and heated in a tube furnace. The
thermometers were inserted from opposite ends
of the furnace and butted together at a position
of minimum temperature gradient so that they
would be as nearly as possible at the same tem-
perature. (In early tests the thermometers were
physically reversed in position to verify that they
were at the same temperature.) Bridge excitation
during the tests was 5 v dc. With this excitation
the AT measurement sensitivity was approximately
2.7 mv/°F at 32°F and approximately 0.66 mv/°F
at 1200°F. Preliminary checks showed that 5-v
excitation would not cause appreciable self-
heating error.

Phase 1 tests were performed by heating the
elements from room temperature to a preselected
temperature, operating at this temperature for
varying periods of time, and then cooling to room
temperature. The bridge output voltage was ob-
served during the cycle to detect calibration
shifts and to determine the degree of mismatch of
the calibration of the two thermometers. Before
and after each cycle, the ice bath (32°F) resist-

ance of each element was measured to determine
the magnitude of any shift which occurred.
Results of tests to date indicate that:

1. Calibration shifts do not occur if the ther-
mometers are operated below 1200°F.

2. Calibration shifts do occur when the ther-
mometers are operated above 1200°F; the
magnitude of these shifts increases with in-
creasing temperature above 1200°F.

3. Extended operation at high temperatures tends
to restore the original calibration and to sta-
bilize the calibration for subsequent operation
at lower temperatures. (The shifts are appar-
ently caused by induced stresses which are
annealed by extended operation at high tem-
peratures.)

4. The rate of annealing and stabilization is very
slow at 1200°F and increases markedly with
increase in annealing temperature. No appre-
ciable annealing occurs at room temperature in
any reasonable period of time.

5. Subsequent operation above the annealing tem-
perature or above the highest previous operating
temperature (whichever was greater) results in
further shifts.

6. Extended operation at the highest temperature
for which the thermometers are rated (1500°F)
will restore the original calibration and sta-
bilize the thermometers for all temperatures
within the rating.

7. Both sets of thermometers were well matched,
and resistances were well within manufac-
turers’ tolerances before the first shifts oc-
curred.

8. Resistance thermometers continue to offer
promise of being useful devices for precise
measurement of absolute and differential tem-
peratures in molten-salt systems.

H. W. Hoffman

9.1 INTRODUCTION

The design of molten-salt reactors requires de-
tailed information on the transport process (heat,
mass, and momentum transfer) and the thermo-
physical properties of the proposed fuel, coolant,
and blanket mixtures. The studies on molten
salts described below are a part of the effort
funded at ORNL by the Special Technology Branch,
Division of Reactor Development and Technology,
U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, directed to ad-
vancing our understanding of phenomena common
to general classes of reactors.

While molten salts may be classed as normal
thermal transport media,’'? experience® during the
ANP program also pointed up strongly the need
for heat transfer measurements with the specified
reactor salts to detect the presence and delineate
the effects of such adverse factors as nonwetting
or the formation of low-conductivity surface films.
Recent studies in this area are described in the
first of the following sections.

The second area considered in this report is
that of the thermophysical properties of the molten
salts; this includes both the estimation and meas-
urement of these properties. A major effort was
mounted during the ANP program to develop meas-

urement techniques and to provide the data neces-
sary to reactor design, and there resulted much
information on the properties of a wide variety

of molten salts.* With somewhat narrowed scope,
these studies were continued as a part of the
Molten-Salt Reactor Program during the period
1958-1962.° Work was resumed in 1967 in
response to questions raised by MSRE operation
and is continuing now in support of the Molten-
Salt Breeder Reactor Program.

Finally, this report covers the beginning of an
experimental effort to obtain the mass-transfer
(diffusion) coefficients needed to evaluate and
develop the proposed scheme of circulating inert
gas bubbles with the molten-salt stream outside
the reactor core as a means for removing gaseous
fission products.

The apparatus assembled for studying heat
transfer with the molten salts is shown schemat-
ically in Fig. 9.1. Salt is induced to flow, first
in one direction and then in the other, through a

alternately pressurizing with an inert gas the

salt storage vessels located at each end of the
test channel. Each salt reservoir is suspended
from a weigh cell whose recorded signal provides
data on the liquid flow rate and, simultaneously,
effects flow reversal by actuating solenoid valves
controlling the gas flow. Initial experiments are
being conducted with the proposed single-region
MSBR fuel mixture (LiF-BeF,-ThF ,-UF,, 67.5-
20-12-0.5 mole %). Later experiments will

utilize the coolant mixture NaF-NaBF, (8-92 mole
%). Operation with this latter melt requires main-
taining a BF ;-argon mixture over the salt to
prevent significant change in the mixture composi-
tion (and accompanying sharp increase in melt-

ing temperature) through loss of the volatile BF .
In turn, this is dependent on the development of
satisfactory means for introducing, circulating,
storing, and disposing of this toxic gas. A system
for accomplishing this has been designed and
partially fabricated. In view of the lower volatility
of the components in the fuel mixture, argon
treated to remove residual oxygen and water vapor
is being used as the pressurizing and cover gas
in the first experiments. The effluent gas is
vented to the outside of the building.

current through the tube wall. The electrodes
also serve as the end plates of disk-and-donut
mixing chambers located at each end of the test
section; a detail of this region is shown in Fig.
9.2. In preliminary operation, overheating at the
connection between the power cables and the
Inconel electrodes caused severeoxidation of the
copper cables. To eliminate this, a water-cooled
section was installed between the cable and the
electrode. Twenty-four 0.005-in.-diam Chromel-
Alumel thermocouples welded to the outside tube
wall at ™~ 1-in. intervals measure the temperature
distribution along the test section; sheath-type
couples inserted in wells in the mixing chambers
measure the inlet and outlet fluid temperatures.
The test section is insulated by vermiculite con-
tained in a box enclosing the test unit. Thermal
expansion of the test section was accommodated
by attaching to the freely suspended salt reservoirs
wires that were coaxial with the test section and,
after passing over insulated pulleys, carried heavy
weights.

The isothermal and heat-loss characteristics of
the test section, the uniformity of the wall heat

generation, and the absence of effects on the
thermocouple readings of the tube-wall current
were established in an extensive series of pre-
liminary tests. Following these, initial heat
transfer runs were made at Reynolds moduli be-
tween 700 and 20,000, heat fluxes from 3 x 104
to 6 x 10° Btu hr~! ft—2, and mean fluid tem-
peratures between 1230 and 1510°F. The data
obtained are summarized in Table 9.1. Axial
inside-wall temperature profiles are shown in
Figs. 9.3 through 9.5 for selected values of the
Reynolds modulus. As noted in each case graphed,
the axial wall temperature pattern shows oscilla-
tions not found in previous molten-salt studies.
Curves fitted to the data as a part of the search
for rational understanding may not, at this time,
be of particular significance.

Run 48, shown in Fig. 9.3, was performed in
the laminar flow regime (Reynolds modulus = 738).
The scatter in the wall temperature data is of the
order of +0.5%: in isothermal runs at 1200°F, the
temperature variation was less than +0.2%. Based
on the mean line through the data, the derived
heat transfer coefficient is ~ 277 Btu hr—! ft= 2
(°F)~ !, and the corresponding Colburn j factor
~0.0054. When compared with a plot of the
Seider-Tate equation® (the Colburn factor with a
viscosity gradient correction), this value cor-
responds to the curve for a heated length-to-
diameter ratio of 100. Since the actual tube
length is 133, this constitutes rather good agree-
ment. In contrast, the thermal entrance length
suggested by the data is ™~ 55 tube diameters,
whereas theory’ predicts 336 for a fluid with
Prandtl modulus of 9.1 at a Reynolds modulus of
738.

Figures 9.4 and 9.5 show axial temperature
profiles that differ significantly from the one
displayed in Fig. 9.3. The initial temperature
rise is observed to be followed by a temperature
decrease and this, in turn, by an irregular wall
temperature pattern. We currently believe that the
first part of these curves depicts a laminar-
turbulent transition, despite the fact that the mean
bulk Reynolds modulus for run 47 (Fig. 9.5) was
~20,000. Downstream of this, for run 35 (Fig.
9.4), the wall temperature appears to increase in

An absolute, variable-gap apparatus is being
used to measure the thermal conductivity of the
salt mixtures proposed for the MSBR. A schematic
representation of this device is shown in Fig.

9.6. Heat from the main heater is transferred
downward through the liquid sample region (labeled
‘“‘variable gap’’ in the figure) to an air-cooled

sink; heat flow in the upward and radial direc-
tions is minimized by appropriately located guard
heaters. The heat flux into the sample is ob-
tained from measurement (voltage and current)

of the dc power to the main heater. The tempera-

ture drop across the gap is determined from

thermocouples located on the axial center line in
the metal surfaces defining the sample region; in
Fig. 9.6 the position of the couples is indicated
by closed dots. The sample thickness is varied
by moving the ‘‘piston’’
heater; the separation of the upper surface from

containing the main

the fixed bottom surface is measured by a preci-
sion dial indicator. The system temperature
level is maintained by a surrounding zone-con-
trolled furnace. The salt whose conductivity is
to be measured is generally introduced into the
apparatus in powdered form. The system is then
evacuated and held under vacuum conditions un-
til the salt is melted. During operation an ap-
propriate cover gas at atmospheric pressure is
added to the system.

The measured temperature difference can be
resolved into the temperature drop across the
sample gap, the temperature drops in the metal
walls defining the test region, the temperature
101

drops in any solid or gaseous films adhering to

the metal surfaces, and errors associated with
thermocouple calibration, lead-wire inhomogeneities
in thermal gradient regions, and instrument mal-
functions. Neglecting the error term, we can write

ATT :ATS +ATm+ATf, (1)

where the subscripts are T = total, s = sample,
m = metal, and f = surface film.

For the sample region, the temperature differ-
ence is given by

AT = Q/A) AxJ/k (2)

where Q/A is the heat flux, Ax_ is the gap width,
and k_ is the thermal conductivity of the liquid
sample. It is assumed that no natural convection
exists in the sample region.

Similarly, the temperature drop in the confining
horizontal metal walls can be written

AT = ©/A) Ax /k,, 3)

where Axm is the heat-flow path length in the
metal walls, and k_ is the wall conductivity. The
heat flux, Q/A, is the same as in Eq. (2); this
assumes no radial heat flow and no bypass heat
flow through the side (vertical) walls of the
sample cup. Since k_ is a function of temperature,
Eq. (3) is usually written separately for the upper
and lower metal walls; however, for the purposes
of this analysis, the two regions are lumped.

The film temperature difference is of the same
form as the AT’s given in Egs. (2) and (3). If
surface films are present but of constant and
known thickness, Ax,, during the experiment,
there is no effect on the derived sample con-
ductivity or on the associated error. A film that
grows or decays in an unknown way during the
course of the measurement introduces an error in
AXS.

Thus the sample thermal conductivity is ob-
tained as

or

This is of the form
y =ax + b, (5)

where a is the slope of this linear expression and
is the reciprocal of the sample conductivity, and

b is the intercept and lumps all other resistances.
In operating the apparatus, Q/4 is kept constant,
and ATT is recorded as Ax_ is discretely varied.

This apparatus has been used to obtain pre-
liminary data on three molten fluoride mixtures.
The smoothed values are given in Table 9.2,
along with calibration results obtained with
mercury, water, HiTec salt (NaNOz-NaNOS—KNO3,
40-7-53 wt %), helium, and argon. This table
also shows literature values for the calibration
fluids and recommended values at the melting
temperature (based on calibration and other antic-
ipated corrections) for the three fluoride melts.
We find that, in general, results with the calibra-
tion fluids are higher than published literature
values; most of the observed difference can be
attributed to heat losses which become increas-
ingly significant with decreasing conductivity.

In evaluating the present results, it must be
noted that the apparatus used was designed to
minimize the error with fluids having thermal con-
ductivities in the range 0.05 to 0.10 w cm™!
(°C)™ 1, thatis, the guard heating was designed to
make axial and radial heat losses negligible for
salts having conductivities in this range. The
data of Table 9.2 show that the actual conductiv-
ities of the fluoride salts are about an order of
magnitude lower than expected and that correc-
tions must be made for heat loss. An analysis
taking into account the multiple modes of axial
and radial heat transfer as well as the specimen
properties, the absolute temperature level, and
the capability of the guard heaters has given cor-
rections that are consistent with the apparatus
calibrations. Final data correction should be
available soon.

In the light of the above comments, some dis-
cussion of these sources of ‘‘absolute’’ error in
a variable-gap thermal conductivity device is
warranted to provide proper perspective for inter-
preting data obtained. First, we consider the
heat transport across the sample region. Refer-
ring to Fig. 9.6, we observe that both the main
(upper) heater and the test cell are guard heated.
The operator attempts to adjust these guard
heaters such that the heat flow through the liquid

sample is axially downward parallel to the ap-
paratus vertical center line. However, if the ad-
justments are not sufficiently precise — and this
is difficult to accomplish — some radial heat flow
will be present. The reduced axial heat flow
gives rise to a lower measured ATT and, since
Q/A is based on the measured power to the main
heater, to a further reduced value for ATT/(Q/A).
The consequence of this is curvature in the data
plot from which k_ is derived, with deviations be-
low the “‘true’’ straight line increasing with in-
creasing Axs and probably with increasing average
temperature level. This is illustrated by the
data from the NaBF, measurements shown in Fig.
9.7. The detailed analysis mentioned above is
also being used to provide design guidelines for
minimizing this effect in a new apparatus cur-
rently being fabricated.

A second factor to be considered is natural
circulation within the liquid sample; the presence

of natural circulation again leads to k values that
are incorrect on the high side. The cell is de-
signed to weaken this effect; it is heated from
above so that a stable temperature profile exists,
and the aspect ratio of the sample region (upper
plate radius over sample gap) is of the order of
50:1. Edge effects may exist, since circulation
cells set up in the annular gap around the upper
(main) heater probably extend into the peripheral
regions of the sample disk. We feel this effect is
small, although one investigator claims that even
at an aspect ratio 21/2 times that of the present
device, some natural convection effects were ob-
served at the cell center line. A more serious
possibility for liquid motion exists in regard to
some skewness of the sample gap with respect to
the gravitational vector. This would cause the
hot fluid to “‘spill’’ off the upper surface at one

edge and cooler fluid to return in counterflow
along the bottom surface. Such flow could be

highly complex, since the temperature distribution
outside the sample region also has a role in de-
fining the fluid circuits. It should be noted that,
while the ‘‘parallelness’’ of the two surfaces de-

all other factors being ‘‘perfect,’’ periodic or

vection cells to develop even in a temperature-
stabilized geometry.

A third heat transport mode that must be con-
sidered is thermal radiation. When present, this
also leads to apparent conductivities that are
higher than the true molecular conductivities.

For transparent liquids of relatively low molecular
conductivity, the radiation contribution can be
appreciable. Earlier evaluations (presuming all

of the observed curvature in the data to be due to
radiation) have convinced us that the radiation
contribution could, in some instances, be as high
as 10%. This view has been tempered somewhat
as our awareness of the magnitude of radial heat
loss and convection effects has increased. In
addition, if the fluid medium is absorbing, radia-

103

tion transfer is further reduced. Thus a calcula-
tion based on NaBF, data — assuming a trans-
parent medium and a surface emissivity of 0.2 —
suggests that 6% of the heat transfer could be by
radiation. For a partially absorbing medium with
an absorption coefficient of 2/cm (based on an
estimate by Cooke) at a maximum gap thickness
of 0.1 cm, the radiation transfer would be reduced
by about 20%.

A number of additional problems were encountered
in the NaBF , measurements. During the first of
three sets of measurements, loss of BF, caused
a shift in the melt composition toward the NaF-
rich side of the NaF-NaBF, phase diagram, with
an accompanying sharp increase in the melting
temperature and probably a marked change in
sample conductivity. This eventually led to
failure of the system heaters and severe damage to
the apparatus. In the second set of measurements,
thermocouple outputs were observed to be erratic;
this condition was found to result from inhomo-
geneities in the thermocouple lead wires. For the
final data set, a BF3 cover-gas system was in-
stalled to prevent melt composition changes.
Despite all these problems, the total scatter of
all three data sets was less than £13%.

At present we estimate the uncertainty in our
preliminary measurements to be between + 15 and
~ 35%; corrected values should have an uncertainty
of less than +15%. These studies are being
continued, and with a new apparatus the accuracy
should be further improved. In addition, a planned
thorough study of the effect on the thermal con-
ductivity of composition changes in a given salt
system should lead to more reliable equations for
predicting conductivities.

9.3.2 Heat Capacity

Measurements were completed for the enthalpy
of the MSRE coolant mixture, LiF-BeF, (66-34
mole %), in the liquid range. Two separate salt
samples contained in Inconel capsules were used
with two copper-block drop calorimeters.® These
calorimeters were calibrated using sapphire
crystals certified by the National Bureau of
Standards.

The total error in the enthalpy was found to be of

calorimeter calibration error of £0.5%. The data
are summarized graphically in Fig. 9.8; the line
shown is the above least-squares fit to the data.

value of 0.56 cal g~ ! (°C)~! reported by another
investigator for the LiF-BeF, (67—33 mole %)

Data in the solid region were too limited for
significant evaluation. However, a melting tem-
perature of 480 + 20°C was suggested with a
latent heat of fusion (which may include transi-
tions) of the order of 115 cal/g.

The enthalpy apparatus has been repaired and
recalibrated preliminary to measurements with the
MSRE coolant mixture in the solid region and
with the MSBR single-region fuel mixture (LiF-
BeF -ThF,-UF,, 67.5-20-12-0.5 mole %). A
limited study of existing and potential errors

associated with the copper-block calorimeter has
disclosed no significant new sources of error.

9.3.3 Property Prediction

Two methods for estimating the thermal con-
ductivity of molten fluoride mixtures were re-
viewed, namely, that due to Rao’ and that due
to Bridgman. 10

In 1941, Rao derived the basic relation, k =
4kv/x, for the vibrational conductivity of a common
liquid and substituted the Lindemann equation for
the single frequency, v, of particles vibrating in
a cubic arrangement to obtain

k=B(T_/My*/3)1/2, 7

where k = thermal conductivity [wem™ ! (°C) 1,

Kk = Boltzmann constant, x = molecul ar spacing
(em), T = melting temperature (°K), ¥ = molecular
weight, V = molar volume (em?), and B = constant.
This constant B was evaluated from the few
available values of the Debye frequencies for such
salts as KCI, KBr, NaCl, etc. For the molten
salts, M/n and V/n should be used in Eq. (7);

n is the average number of discrete ions per mole =
Z XN, and M is the average molecular weight =

where y is the ratio of specific heats.

tures; the results are compared in Table 9.4 along
with some experimental values. The agreement
between conductivities predicted by Eq. (8) and
experimental values is excellent for the chloride
and nitrate salts listed in the lower part of Table
9.4. This is not surprising, since the theory is
based primarily on such single-component systems.
Further, this agreement is obtained without manip-
ulation of the coefficients or exponents in Eq.

(8). In contrast, the same comparison for the
fluoride melts shows only adequate agreement be-
tween the predicted and measured values. This
discrepancy may result in part from uncertainties
in the experimental data; the values shown were
obtained in earlier measurements with a less-
refined apparatus and are still considered pre-
liminary.

9.4 MASS TRANSFER TO CIRCULATING
BUBBLES

T. S. Kress J. J. Keyes, ]Jr.

A method for removing fission product gases
“from the fuel salt in a molten-salt breeder reactor
utilizes cocurrently flowing small helium bubbles
to strip '3*Xe from the circulating fuel. The
fundamental theoretical problem involved is the
description of a scalar transfer within a turbulent
shear-flow field as influenced by the presence in
the bulk region far from confining walls of a phase
interface (bubble) having either rigid or mobile
characteristics. The s~ope of this just-commis-
sioned study includes ihe measurement of mass
transfer coefficients in a two-phase flowover a
significant range of the controlling variables and
the correlation of these coefficients with theoreti-
cal concepts.

The proposed experiment will use helium bubbles
to remove dissolved oxygen (simulating '*°Xe)
from room-temperature glycerine-water solutions
(simulating fused salt). The choice of the oxygen-
water-glycerine system was based on an earlier
study!? showing that dynamic similarity with
presently conceived MSBR designs could be
easily attained. The oxygenated glycerine-water
mixture will be circulated through the closed loop
diagrammed in Fig. 9.9. The oxygen is then pro-
gressively stripped by transfer to helium bubbles
introduced at the test channel inlet and removed
at the test channel exit. The size, number, and
spatial distribution of these bubbles will be ob-
tained by photographic techniques; the oxygen
concentration will be determined with a Beckman

analyzer. The range of the variables to be covered
is indicated in Fig. 9.10.

If the average mass transfer coefficient within
the test section is constant, the concentration
change between inlet and outlet (C__./C, ) would
be some constant K (less than 1) that includes
such factors as the equilibrium solution coef-
ficient, the mass transfer coefficient, bubble
surface area, test section length, and gas and
liquid flow rates.!? Thus, if 7 is the transit time
for a fluid particle to complete a circuit of the
loop, a plot of log concentration vs time would
approximate a straight line with a slope of — (1 —
K)/7. Since the factors involved in K are either
known or to be measured, the average mass trans-
fer coefficient can be extracted from the slope of
the curve.

Typical curves obtained from such experiments
might appear as shown in Fig. 9.11. For this
calculation, it has been assumed that the helium

flow is 1 vol % of the liquid flow, the helium bub-
bles are 0.01 in. in diameter, the test channel is
2 in. in diameter and 25 ft long, and the transit
time is twice that required to traverse the test
section. Mass transfer coefficients were esti-
mated by the expression taken from Calderbank
and Moo-Young: 1_3

N. is the Schmidt modulus (¢/p D ), h , is the

Part 3. Chemistry

W. R. Grimes

The chemical research and development effort
described in this chapter includes a wide variety
of studies of concern to the Molten-Salt Reactor
Experiment (MSRE) and to more advanced molten-
salt reactor systems.

A major share of these studies is, as in pre-
vious periods in this series, concerned with de-
tails of the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment.
Routine analysis of the MSRE fuel and coolant
salts, and special analyses of fuel and pump-
bowl gas samples for fission products were con-
tinued until operations with 235U fuel were com-
pleted in March. Further information regarding
distribution of fission products (especially the
more noble species) has been obtained through
examination of the graphite and metal surveil-
lance specimens and sections of the off-gas
lines removed during the shutdown.

Study of fission product behavior has been
continued with fuel specimens removed from
MSRE, with ‘“‘synthetic’’ fuel mixtures doped
with radiotracer elements, and by investigation
of the chemistry of molybdenum and niobium
fluoride in molten fluoride mixtures.

Chemical separations processes for application
to single-fluid Molten-Salt Breeder Reactors
continue to show promise. Recovery of uranium

10. Chemistry

Operation of the MSRE with the 2?°U-233U fuel
salt was completed during the early part of the
current report period, as described in Chap. 1.
Reprocessing of the flush and fuel salts occupied
the remainder of the period, and the chemistry of

and protactinium and their complete separation
by selective extraction into molten bismuth con-
taining dissolved thorium has been demonstrated
in laboratory-scale equipment. An alternative
process based on selective precipitation of
protactinium and uranium oxides continues to
show promise and to yield useful information
concerning pertinent oxide-fluoride equilibria.
Reductive extraction of the lanthanide fission
products continues to prove more difficult than
the protactinium-uranium extraction but may well
lead to useful separations.

A broad program in solution thermodynamics,
electrochemistry and spectrochemistry, and
transport processes in molten fluorides con-
tinues to supply basic data for reactor and
chemical process design. Physicochemical in-
vestigations of fluoroborate mixtures continued
to yield useful data for evaluation of these ma-
terials as secondary coolants.

Research and development in analytical
chemistry continue to be directed primarily to-
ward improvement in analysis of intensely radio-
active specimens for oxide and especially for
U3* in the fuel and for impurities and fission
products in the helium gas from MSRE.

10.1 CHEMICAL FEASIBILITY OF FUELING
MOLTEN-SALT REACTORS
WITH PLUTONIUM TRIFLUORIDE

R. E. Thoma

The feasibility of starting molten-salt reactors
with plutonium trifluoride was evaluated with respect
to chemical compatibility within the fuel system
and to removal of plutonium from the fuel by chem-
ical reprocessing after 23°Pu burnout. Results
of the evaluation are reported in a recent technical
memorandum. ' In summary, compatibility in the
reactor is moderately well assured but requires
confirmation of PuF | solubility and oxide tolerance
before tests can be made using the MSRE. Although
the chemical separation of plutonium and protac-
tinium that would be desirable in a large breeder
reactor has not yet been demonstrated, conceptual
design of processes for effecting such separations
are available for development.

10.2 CHEMICAL DETERMINATION
OF BURNUP IN 235U OPERATIONS

R. E. Thoma

An extensive program of sampling and analysis
has been an integral part of all operations with
the MSRE. Of the analytical chemical methods
which are commonly employed, coulometric
titration of dilute aqueous solutions of the
fuel salt has found most general application?
because of its excellent reproducibility and high
precision, ~ +0.5%. Notwithstanding, the preci-
sion of individual chemical assays of the uranium
concentration in MSRE fuel salt samples has only
been about one-tenth that obtainable from on-site
computations of the reactivity balance.® In addi-

tion, until recently there appeared to be a growing
disparity between the measured chemical values
and those obtained from nuclear and heat balance
data, as noted in the previous report.* The chem-
ical results used were obtained from radiochem-
ical and mass spectrochemical as well as coulo-
metric analysis of the fuel salt, and from flu-
orometric and delayed-neutron activation analysis
of the flush salt. The trend of the analyses
indicated that the concentration of uranium in

the fuel salt, as measured by chemical methods,
was lower by ~0.5% (~0.02 wt %) than that
computed from operational data.

One possible explanation of the disparity was
that the maximum operating power of the MSRE
was about 11% greater than assumed in the
reactivity balance, that is, 8.0 rather than 7.25
Mw (thermal), and, indeed, there were reasons to
be suspicious of the power level. In particular,
there was an anomalously pronounced temperature
coefficient in the values of coolant salt heat
capacity that were used to compute the heat
removal.® Experiments were initiated, therefore,
to obtain accurate values for the heat capacity
of the coolant salt. The results® showed that
the heat capacity of the coolant salt is 0.571 £
0.043 cal g=! (°C)™! in the temperature range
500 to 700°C, about 10% higher than the values
used in previous estimates.

The nominal concentration of uranium in the fuel
circuit therefore was recomputed from the reactor
operating history using a maximum power genera-
tion rate of 8.0 Mw (thermal). The results of this
computation are in excellent agreement with the
chemical analyses and show (see Fig. 10.1) that
the concentration at the termination of run 14
should have been 4.532 wt %.” The corresponding
analytical value from a least-squares extrapolation
of the analytical data was 4.528 wt % (Fig. 10.1).
This difference between the reactivity and
analytical chemistry values corresponds to 0.2
kg of uranium out of 220 kg, which is only 0.10%.
The difference is even less when derived from a
statistical treatment of analytical results. From
the normalized values for uranium analysis, as
shown in Fig. 10.2, it is seen that the slope

that uranium losses to the off-gas stream, if any,
have been immeasurably small; (2) that the fuel
salt is as chemically stable after long periods
of reactor operation, as was originally anticipated;

10.3 HIGH-TEMPERATURE FUEL
SALT-GRAPHITE COMPATIBILITY
EXPERIMENT

C. F. Weaver R. G. Ross

It has been suggested® that tests to show whether
reactions occur between the constituents of the
fuel and graphite at temperatures up to and includ-
ing boiling at 1 to 2 atm pressure are important to
evaluations of the safety and practicality of
molten-salt reactors.

The initial experiment was designed to detect
any gross incompatibility in the salt-graphite
system, as well as to provide information which
might be useful in the design of future experiments.
The experiment involved heating to 1400°C
(estimated boiling point of MSRE fuel salt) a
specimen of MSRE grade graphite in contact with
MSRE fuel salt contained in a tube of AT]J graphite
with a static helium overpressure of 1.3 atm. The
experimental setup is shown in Fig. 10.1. The
tantalum foil was wrapped around the graphite
tube in order to afford some protection for the
alumina container in the event of a severe leak
through the graphite tube.

The salt was heated to 1400°C in a sequence
of three separate trials at 800, 1200, and 1400°C.
The heating rate was ~ 100%hr, and steady state
at the desired temperature was maintained for
about 15 min before cooling to room temperature

for examination. After each heating and cooling
cycle the container was opened in a dry box, and
the graphite tube was examined for indications of
salt leakage or adverse container reactions before
proceeding to the next higher temperature. The
pressure was followed with a Bourdon gage
(sensitivity limit ~ 0.5 psi) throughout each run.
No gas generation was observed. Upon comple-
tion of the 1400°C cycle the graphite tube was cut
open, and the MSRE-graphite specimen and fuel
salt were removed for more detailed examination.
Visual examination of the graphite specimen
revealed no indication of attack by the salt,
and its dimensions, determined with a micrometer,
were essentially unchanged. The portion which
had been in the gas phase was coated with beads
of salt which were almost petfectly spherical in
shape; thus there was no wetting by the condensed
salt. Samples of the salt from various regions

were examined petrographically and by x-ray powder

diffraction, and bulk samples were submitted for
spectrochemical analysis.

Salt crystals which were identified as ZrF were

found on the outside of the graphite tube in a region

(4A in Fig. 10.3) that was well below the maximum
temperature of the experiment and considerably
above room temperature. This material was
identified both by x-ray diffraction and by petro-
graphic analysis and was surprisingly free of other
substances. However, A1F3, BeF,, and LiF—BeF2
glass were found on the tantalum foil in a nearby
region (4B, Fig. 10.3). No uranium compounds
were detected in these colorless deposits. Since
the open end of the tube was in a water-cooled
connector, one is led to conclude that the ZrF ,
BeF ,, and LiF vapors must have come through
the AT]J graphite tube.

The salt beads from the graphite specimen
were composed of compounds of LiF, Ber, and
ZrF ,; and although there was a slight greenish
color, uranium compounds were not detected
by x-ray or petrographic examination. The sample
from the lower-temperature region (3A, Fig. 10.3)
was richer in BeF , than was the sample from the
higher-temperature region (3B, Fig. 10.3). The
fraction of salt involved in these vapor deposits
was small, but the time at 1400°C was only ~15
min.

Samples of the bulk salt were examined, with
particular emphasis on detection of carbides
and compounds which could have come from
container materials. The only significant dif-

of the starting salt and salt from the experiment
were lines associated with ZrO , and lines which
could not be attributed to anything other than
UF,. Carbides were not detected.

The lines attributed to UF , were strongest in
samples taken near the liquid-vapor interface
(2A, Fig. 10.3). Uranium trifluoride could not
be positively identified by petrographic examina-
tion, but an unidentified dark-colored phase which
had the hexagonal morphology typical of UF,
was detected.

The Z:0, was probably formed by reaction of
Zik with small amounts of moisture from the
starting materials. Most of the zirconium remained
as the fluoride. The UF ; may have resulted from
a reaction of the UF, and graphite. While thermo-
dynamics indicates that the reaction

of a mechanism for the removal of CF, would
greatly increase the production of UF - In this

Spectrochemical analysis of the bulk salt (1
and 2A, Fig. 10.3) indicates higher concentrations
of aluminum than was present in the starting salt.
This, as well as the presence of AlF , mentioned
previously, indicates that reaction (2) may have
occurred. Reaction (3) is known to occur readily
at elevated temperature. It should be emphasized
that the mechanism proposed is applicable to this
experimental design, not to MSR conditions, and
that most of the uranium remained in the 4 state.

This experiment seems to confirm that there is
no gross incompatibility of MSRE fuel and graphite
at 1400°C. However, graphite (at least AT]
variety) is permeated by the volatile components
of the fuel near its boiling point and therefore
is an unsatisfactory container.

10.4 EXAMINATION OF A CORRODED CAP
FROM A SAMPLE CAPSULE

S. S. Kirslis F. F. Blankenship

A metallic object about % in. in diameter was
retrieved by a magnet from the MSRE pump bowl,
as described in the first section of this report.

It was identified as the mild-steel cap of a

10-g copper sampling ladle by the visible remains
of the % -in.-diam hole for the copper pin and by
two ¥, -in.-diam holes, 1/4 in. apart, through which
the stainless steel cable passed. The severely
corroded cap weighed only 3.06 g, compared with
its original weight of 22.23 g. This amount of
cotrosion occurred in nine months. The cap had
originally been nickel plated.

Under a hot-cell stereomicroscope capable of
magnifying to 30x, the metal surface appeared
porous, like charcoal. Yet when probed and
scraped for sampling, it was very difficult to
remove any metal, perhaps because the porous

S
layer was cemented with salt. The Y _-in. holes
were surrounded by areas of white flush salt.

A thin flaky layer of flush salt also covered
much of the ¥ -in. hole area.

The corroded cap was sectioned through the 1/32

in. holes and submitted for metallographic
examination by E. L. Long. The cut section
showed a small core of solid metal surrounded
by empty spaces and flaky or granular deposits.
Metallographic examination indicated that all of
the metallic regions were mild steel. In places,
the original nickel plate was intact. The surface
of the metal had a metallographic appearance
tvpical of corrosion and not characteristic of
mechanical breaking off or abrasion. A curious
observation was that the individual strands of

stainless steel braided cable in the 1/32-ir1. holes

had dissolved away, leaving hollow metallic
tubes where they had been.

Some of the porous flaky film was scraped off
the remaining half of the cap, and both film and
scraped cap were analyzed chemically and radio-
chemically. The scraped cap piece weighed 0.67
g and contained 80.3% Fe, 0.024% Ni, 0.19% Be,
and 0.39% Li. The noble-metal activities were
somewhat higher (1 x 10° to 2.5 x 10!° dis min—!
g~ 1) than the activities which form stable fluorides
(5 x 107 to 4.6 x 10°). The few milligrams of
scraped film contained 0.5 mg Fe, less than 0.01
mg Ni, 0.30 mg Li, 0.18 mg Be, and 0.013 mg Zr.
The noble-metal activities again were usually
higher (1.2 x 10% to 2.0 x 10° dis/min) than the
other activities (1.9 x 107 to 2.2 x 108).

The absence of heavy nickel or noble-metal
deposits on the steel cap indicates that the corro-
sion was probably not due to displacement reac-
tions of the type Ni?* + Fe - Ni + Fe?™.

Possibly, the corrosion reaction was 2UF, +
Fe - F‘eF2 + 2UF3. For this to have occurred,
there must have been no elemental iron suspended
in the fuel. Analyses of the fuel have regularly
indicated that about 135 ppm of iron was present,

114

It was known, however, that, because of the
reducing nature of the fuel, due to UF ,, such an
amount of iron ion was not present. Hence it was
sometimes assumed that iron, if present at all,
was a colloidal suspension. Now that the cor-
rosion of the cap has been observed, we believe
that there is no elemental iron present. This
implies that the analytical numbers were not
valid at this low concentration range, and,
indeed, tests on the reduction of tracer iron
have confirmed this implication. Also, if this
explanation holds, there must have been no
elemental chromium available, as from addition
of beryllium or even as chromium in Hastelloy N.
This may be evidence that the Hastelloy N is
coated with noble-metal fission products.

Superficially, the condition of an iron cap in
contact with a copper capsule appears to be
favorable for bimetallic couple corrosion. How-
ever, for iron to have dissolved as the anodic
reaction, an equivalent reduction of cations
more noble than ferrous iron at the cathode
was required. The absence of such noble
ions, again as a result of the presence of
UFS, precludes the bimetallic couple explana-
tion. Of course, the reduction at the copper
would have been U** going to U3*, but in this
case the cell reaction becomes the equation
discussed in the last paragraph.

A more likely explanation is that an electrode
concentration cell was involved. Thus iron was
removed from a high-concentration electrode, the
iron cap, and deposited at a low-concentration
electrode, the walls of the primary system. This
could have occurred even with a very low con-
centration of Fe2" in the salt and with electrical
contact between the iron and Hastelloy N.

There was nothing in the chemistry of the
corrosion of the iron that endangered the
compatibility of the MSRE fuel with its sur-
roundings.

1. Fission Product Behavior

11.1 FISSION PRODUCT BEHAVIOR
IN THE MSRE

S. S. Kirslis F. F. Blankenship

Previous work!—* has sought to establish the
ultimate fate of nuclides generated by fission in
the MSRE fuel. It was found that species with
stable fluorides remained largely in the fuel. The
noble metal species possessing less stable fluo-
rides (Mo, Tc, Te, Ru, and Nb) behaved quite
differently, with less than 1% remaining in the fuel
salt and the remainder depositing on graphite and
metal surfaces or being carried off with the helium
cover gas.

The behavior of fission products is of practical
concern from three standpoints. First, neutron
economy in an MSBR would be significantly af-
fected if too large a fraction of the noble metal
fission products deposited on the graphite core.
Second, it has recently been realized® that decay
heat from heavy deposits of fission products might
cause dangerous heating of graphite and metal
surfaces in an MSBR in the event that normal cool-
ing mechanisms failed. Third, the design of an
MSBR off-gas system must provide for the appre-
ciable quantities of nongaseous fission products
carried by the off-gas stream.

The practical solution of these problems re-
quires reliable quantitative data on deposition
rates and volatilization rates, together with suffi-
cient basic understanding of the phenomena in-
volved so that results from the MSRE operation may
be safely extrapolated to an MSBR. In the current
report period, progress has been made toward the
first objective by a careful examination and analy-
sis of the third long-term surveillance assembly of
graphite and Hastelloy N specimens, removed from
the MSRE core after the completion of the 235U
operation on March 25, 1968.

11.1.1 Examination of MSRE Surveillance
Specimens After 64,000 Mwhr

A third set of graphite and Hastelloy N long-term
surveillance specimens was removed from the
MSRE core after the March 25, 1968, shutdown and
delivered to the hot cells on April 5 for disassem-
bly, segmenting, and surface sampling. Previous
surveillance assemblies contained only CGB
graphite of the ‘‘core’” and “‘lattice stock’’ vari-
eties. One stringer (RR2) of the third assembly
contained CGB core graphite in top (MR-10),
middle (X-13), and bottom (NR-5) positions. This
stringer was present in both the second and third
long-term irradiation assemblies (7800 to 64,000
Mwhr). A second stringer (RS-3) was exposed to
fissioning salt only through the third irradiation
period (32,000 to 64,000 Mwhr) and contained CGB
core graphite (P-55, Y-9, and P-58), impregnated
CGB core graphite (V-24, P-77, P-92, and V-28),
pyrolytic graphite (PG), and Poco graphite (K-1).
We have been informed by H. Cook that too low a
pressure was used to impregnate the CGB samples
with pitch be fore firing, so that the surfaces of
the impregnated CGB specimens were not as well

115
sealed as had been hoped. The Poco graphite was
characterized by isotropic, uniform, relatively
large pores. Because there were four different
kinds of graphite irradiated for two different irradi-
ation periods in several core positions, it was
necessary to examine and analyze more than the
usual number of graphite specimens.

The 12 graphite specimens were rectangular
bars, each 0.67 in. wide but varying in thickness
from 0.20 to 0.47 in. and in length from 4.5 to 9.5
in. At least two surfaces of each bar were exposed
to flowing fuel salt; the remaining surfaces were
stacked against other graphite surfaces in the
assembly. Each specimen was examined visually
with a 30-power stereomicroscope; then it was
weighed, and the length was measured.

Five of the bars (X-13, PG, K-1, P-58, and P-77)
were cut across the length to provide samples for
milling (3 to 6 in. long), for D. Cuneo’s sanding
procedure (1 to 3 in. long), for metallography and
autoradiography (1/4 in.), for x-ray diffraction (1/4
in.), for electron microscopy (1/4 in.), and for
x radiography (two 10-mil-thick slices). Both ends
of each bar were cut off to exclude the region
covered by the Hastelloy N straps which held the
graphite pieces in place in the assembly. The re-
maining seven graphite specimens were segmented
only to provide samples for surface milling (2 to
5 in.) and for D. Cuneo (1 to 3 in.). Before each
segmenting cut was made, the surface that had
been in contact with graphite was marked with a
thin abrasive wheel.

An improved procedure was developed by Stewart
Dismuke and Warren Parsley to sample the graphite
surfaces in the hot cell. Each piece of graphite
was glued to an accurately machined length of
angle aluminum in such a way that two salt-
exposed surfaces of graphite faced away from the
aluminum. The angle aluminum was bolted to the
movable bed of a milling machine in such a way
that the vertical graphite surface could be moved
past a side milling cutter. A tared plastic sample
bottle was mounted below the rotating cutter to
catch the graphite powder as it was cut off the
mounted specimen. Preliminary tests showed that
95 to 99% of the graphite milled off was collected
in the plastic bottle. Before the surface milling
was started, the same milling machine was used to
mill out 0.055-in. by 0.055-in. grooves along the
comer between surfaces that were to be sampled.
This eliminated the problem of contaminating

116

graphite milled from one surface with that from the
surface of an adjoining face.

It was desired to mill ten successive cuts from a
graphite surface with thicknesses of !, 1/2, 1, 2, 3,
5, 8, 10, 10, and 10 mils for a total sampling depth
of 50 mils. Through a hot-cell window, it proved
difficult to locate the graphite surface with the
cutter within a precision of 1/2 mil for the first cut.
The best procedure proved to be to approach the
surface 1/2 mil at a time with the rotating cutter
and, through a Kollmorgen periscope, watch for
graphite powder falling off the cutter. A few first
cuts several mils thick were taken before this
procedure was settled upon. There were no
problems in controlling the depth of cuts beyond
the first. This milling procedure for sampling,
while more laborious and time-consuming than the
previous planing procedure, was considered
superior in controlling contamination, in providing
thinner first cuts, and in assuring parallel cuts of
uniform thickness.

Ten cuts on two faces were made on samples
X-13, PG, and K-1. Ten cuts on the wide face
and a single 50-mil-deep cut on the narrow face
were made on samples P-58, Y-9, P-77, and P-92.
Only deep (50 mil) cuts on two faces were made on
samples MR-10, NR-5, V-28, and V-24. One deep
cut on the wide face was made on sample P-55.
The sampling scheme was designed to yield more
complete information on the more interesting
specimens.

The milled specimens were weighed and shipped
to the analytical laboratory. Since analyses were
desired for some short-lived fission products (in
particular, °°Mo and 132Te) the hot-cell operations
were carried out as speedily as possible. The
last of the samples from the first ten graphite
specimens were delivered to the analytical labora-
tory by April 15, 1968. It was later decided to
mill samples from two more impregnated graphite
specimens (P-77 and P-92). It was not possible
to determine 9°Mo, 132Te, and !3!I for these last
pieces.

Results of Hot-Cell Examination of Graphite. —
The program of graphite examinations and analyses
was similar to that carried out for previous sur-
veillance specimens. The hot-cell examinations
were repeated mainly to see whether the previous
results were confirmed for several new types of
graphite specimens, and whether any new observa-
tions turned up. The only new type of hot-cell
test was the examination of the graphite surface

.
.

by electron microscope. Under examination with
a 30-power stereomicroscope, the graphite
specimens appeared similar to those from previous
surveillance assemblies. There was no sign of
corrosion or chemical attack. Occasional drop-
lets or flakes of flush salt adhered to the surface,
more frequently on the faces in contact with other
specimens. Flat flakes of dark-green fuel salt
were sometimes found on these back faces. The
adhering salt caused all graphite specimens to
gain at least a few milligrams in weight. Quite a
few scratches and gouges were visible on the
graphite surface, but these appeared to have been
freshly made, probably during the mechanical
operations of disassembly of the package. Most
of the specimens lost between 1 and 9 mils in
length out of a total length of 9 in. Adhering salt
probably accounted for the 5- to 6-mil gain for two
of the 4.6-in.-long specimens. The specimens
were not wiped or scraped before weighing and
measuring, since it was important not to remove
any adhering films before analysis. Except in the
case of Poco graphite a slight loss in length was
expected because of the neutron fluences ex-
perienced by the graphite samples. Contractions
were larger for the more centrally located speci-
mens, where the neutron flux was higher.

The graphite surfaces were examined carefully
under the 30-power stereomicroscope with various
kinds of lighting to detect any surface films. A
brown dusty-looking film was discerned, covering
about half of the fuel-exposed surfaces. No shiny
films were observed.

Surface films were also sought with the hot-cell
electron microscope. Cellulose acetate tape was
dampened with acetone and pressed against a fuel-
exposed surface of a 1/4-in.-long sample from each
graphite bar. After it was dry, the tape was torn
loose. A visible thin film of surface graphite
adhered to the tape. The tape was dissolved away
from the adhering material, which was picked up on
electron microscope screens. The examination of
these screens by the electron microscope showed
only graphite diffraction patterns, although later
spectrographic analyses showed that appreciable
quantities of stable molybdenum isotopes were
present on many of the graphite surfaces. It may
be that the molybdenum deposit was not crystalline
enough to show electron diffraction pattems.

The thin transverse slices from five of the
graphite specimens were examined by x radiogra-
phy. Results were similar to those from previous

117

surveillance specimens. Many of the salt-exposed
surfaces and some of the other surfaces appeared
to have a thin film of heavy material less than 10
mils thick. The only specimen showing cracks
was the pyrolytic graphite. The cracks were
parallel to the graphite planes. Some of the empty
cracks may have occurred during the cutting of
the thin samples of this fragile, brittle material.
However, a halo of heavy material, presumably
fuel salt, was observed in the vicinity of some of
the cracks, while the cracks themselves were
empty (Fig. 11.1). This may have been a filled
crack that opened wider on cutting. The white
band across the end of the specimen was identified
as a ledge of graphite that remained on the speci-
men when it cracked off the bar when the cutting
wheel had nearly cut through.

Five of the graphite specimens were scheduled
for metallographic and autoradiographic examina-

tion and for x-ray diffraction examination of fuel-
exposed surfaces. These examinations have not
been completed.

Radiochemical Analyses of the Graphite Surface
Samples. — The program of graphite analyses was
similar to those for previous surveillance speci-
mens. Twelve specimens were analyzed rather
than the usual three, since four types of graphite
were represented in the third surveillance test.
The objectives of the rather thorough analytical
program were (1) to confirm previous results for
CGB graphite; (2) to compare concentration pro-
files and total deposition of 12 nuclides on CGB,
impregnated CGB, Poco, and pyrolytic graphite;
and (3) to provide more accurate deposition data
needed for solving practical reactor problems.

All of the milled graphite samples were dis-
solved in a mixture of HNO3 and H,50, and ana-
lyzed radiochemically for 2°Mo, 132Te, 129Te,
103Ru, 106Ru, 95Nb, 9521,’ 8951.’ 14OBa, 141ce,
144Ce, and 131]. Selected samples were also

analyzed for 137Cs, 111Ag, 110Ag 91Y, and '#7Nd.

During the dissolutions, traps were provided to
catch volatilizing activities such as Ru and 1.
The traps were analyzed separately. Radiochemi-
cal separations were made before each species
was counted except in the case of rare earths,
where the whole group was isolated and the indi-
vidual components determined by a computer
analysis of the gamma spectrometer scan.

From these analyses and the depth of milling
for each sample, concentration profiles to a depth
of 50 mils were drawn for each nuclide and each
surface sampled. The depth of cut was determined
by dividing the volume of sample (measured
weight divided by density) by the sampled area
(measured length times measured width). For the
thinner samples this procedure was more accurate
than direct reading on the milling machine. Since
there were more than 1200 data points and more
than 120 profile curves, it is not practical to re-
port them in detail here. A few concentration pro-
files will be shown to illustrate particular points
in the ensuing discussion of the general features
of most interest.

The concentration profiles from previous long
irradiations will be compared with the current
profiles for the CGB graphite specimens. Then
the current CGB profiles will be compared with
those for impregnated CGB, pyrolytic, and Poco
graphite. It will help to keep the subsequent de-

tailed discussion in perspective if it is pointed
out now that, in spite of differences in concen-
tration profiles, the total deposition of most
nuclides was surprisingly similar on all the types
of graphite examined.

Four concentration profiles were determined on
three specimens of CGB graphite, all located near
the middle of the MSRE core. Profiles were ob-
tained on the wide face of specimens Y-9 and P-58
(single exposure) and on both a wide and a narrow
face of the doubly exposed X-13 (8000 to 64,000
Mwhr). The profiles were in general similar in
shape to those observed for the two previous sets
of surveillance specimens. Because the first few
cuts were thinner than could be taken with the
previous sampling method, the initial slopes of
the profiles were seen to be steeper than previ-
ously indicated. The concentrations of the noble
metals 2°Mo, '°3Ru, '°®Ru, °5Nb, and '!'Ag
usually dropped by about four orders of magnitude
in penetrating 5 to 10 mils into the graphite. The
four sets of profiles were by no means identical,
however; Fig. 11.2 shows the variations for '°3Ru
between the wide and narrow faces of the X-13
sample. For these nuclides and several others,
the initial concentration gradient for penetration
from the wide face was less steep than for the
narrow face. As previously, variations of this
kind were interpreted to indicate the variable
porosity of CGB graphite even between different
faces of the same specimen.

As previously observed, the 132Te and 1?9Te
profiles showed a more gradual initial drop than
the other noble metals. Among the latter, °°Mo
dropped less precipitously than the Ru or Nb con-
centrations. Thus the noble metals appear to be
diffusing independently of one another, rather than
as combined particles or as, for example, deposits
on microscopic graphite particles. The X-13 pro-
files leveled out at deep penetrations, but the
P-58 profile kept decreasing.

The 95Zr profile was similar in shape to those
of the noble metals, but its activity was lower by
about two orders of magnitude than that of its
daughter, °5Nb (Fig. 11.3). It is clear that ?5Nb,
evidently as metal, penetrated preferentially from
the fuel salt into the graphite. The MSRE pump
bowl gas analyses (and other tests) have shown
that 25Nb (like other noble metal fission products)
has a tendency to concentrate in the gas phase

other species with stable fluorides. This suggests
that the same escaping tendency caused ?°Nb to
leave the fuel and enter the pores of graphite more
readily than ?3Zr. Once in the pores, the °5Nb (and
other noble metals) apparently deposited readily

on the walls of the pores, leading to steep initial
concentration gradients. The fairly level nonzero
tails at deep penetrations indicate a second dif-
fusion process of low capacity but high speed.

The improved milling technique permitted a more
detailed look at the profiles for 8°Sr and '4%Ba.

It had previously been reported that the plots of
the logarithm of concentration vs penetration depth
for these elements were straight lines. This re-
mained true for ®9Sr beyond about 2 mils and for
140Ba beyond about 5 mils, but the initial gradient
was much steeper in all cases. The initial gradi-
ent may have been due to Sr and Ba entering as the
element rather than as the precursor gas. The
linear portions showed a considerable variation

in slope for the 89Sr from zero for both sides of
X-13 to about a factor of 2 per 50 mils for P-58.
Similarly, for 149Ba the linear slopes varied from
a factor of 2 per 50 mils for X-13 to a factor of

20 per 50 mils for P-58. These features are
illustrated in Fig. 11.4, giving the 8°Sr and 14°Ba
profiles for X-13 wide face and P-58. The linear
slope variations illustrated again the variations in
porosity of CGB graphite, and the existence of
two slope regions in each curve implies at least
two simultaneous diffusion mechanisms. The
linear slopes observed for 82Sr and 14%Ba on
these samples were considerably flatter than for
previous CGB specimens.

For the first time, complete profiles were ob-
tained for 141Ce and !44Ce in CGB graphite.
These are shown for X-13 wide face and P-58 in
Fig. 11.5. For '*1Ce there is a steep initial drop
for a few mils, then a flattening to a linear slope.
The linear slopes are only slightly steeper than
for 149Ba, whereas the half-lives of the Xe precur-
sors are 1.7 sec and 16 sec for !*!Ce and !*°Ba
respectively. This suggests that 141Ce has a
mode of diffusion other than as !4 !Xe.

The '#!Ce curves for X-13 and P-58 are un-
accountably different. Both show a steep initial
drop, but the curve for X-13 wide face levels out
at 6 x 108 dis min—1! g—1, while that for P-58 con-
tinues dropping to 1 x 10° dis min—1! g—!. The
profile for Y-O behaved like P-58 and that for X-13
narrow face like X-13 wide face. Cerium-144 has
a very short-lived Xe precursor. The impregnated

samples, so the 1#4Ce is not moving as bulk fuel
salt. The total of this information leads to no
clear explanation of 1#4Ce behavior. It can per-
haps be tentatively concluded that CGB structures
vary in such a way that the low-capacity, high-
speed mechanism leading to flat tails is some-
times but not always blocked for !44Ce.

121

The concentration profile for 3!l in specimen
P-58 was similar to those previously reported,
with a steep initial drop by a factor of 20 in the
first mil, then a progressively less steep gradient,
as for many Te profiles. The profile for X-13 wide
face was less steeply sloped in all parts of the
curve. That for X-13 narrow face was quite dif-
ferent, in fact nearly duplicating the curve for
95Zr on the same face. It dropped sharply through
nearly four orders of magnitude in 7 mils, then
suddenly leveled out. This again shows clearly a
difference in graphite structure for the two faces
of X-13.

Only selected CGB samples were analyzed for
137CS, lllAg’ “OAg, QIY, and 147Nd; these
were taken from X-13 wide face and P-58. The
137Cs dropped by a factor of 15 in the first 5 mils,
then leveled off. Both Ag nuclides dropped by
more than three orders of magnitude in 5 mils. The
°1Y concentration decreased by a factor of 5 in
5 mils, then became level. The '*7Nd dropped
steeply by more than a factor of 100 in 5 mils,
then leveled.

Many of the Y-9 profiles were unusual in that
they exhibited a rise by as much as a factor of 5
after the usual initial drop in concentrations.
Beyond the broad hump, concentrations again de-
creased. The rise was at 10 mils penetration for
99Mo, 95Nb, and 131!I, but at 5 mils penetration for
103Ry, 106Ry, 95Zr, 89Sr, and !44Ce. Some of
these humped profiles are shown in Fig. 11.6.
There was no discernible hump in the profiles for
132Te 129Te, 140Ba, and '4!Ce. No convincing
explanation has been found for the unusual humps.
It is very improbable that analytical error accounts
for the humps, since most of the profiles were
rather smooth monotonically decreasing curves
with less than one point in ten significantly out
of line.

Impregnated CGB Concentration Profiles. — Even
though the impregnation of CGB graphite speci-
mens P-77 and P-92 was not completely success-
ful, an effect on fission product penetration was
measurable. Most profiles were quite similar in
shape to the CGB profiles, resembling the P-58
profiles more than the X-13 profiles, in that the
curves tended to continue dropping at 50 mils
penetration, rather than leveling off like most of
the X-13 profiles. For most isotopes, the im-
pregnated CGB profiles were steeper and reached
lower final concentration than the CGB profiles,

but the differences were not large. However,
pronounced differences were observed for 89Sr and
140Ba. The slopes for 89Sr were a factor of 10
per 50 mils for P-77 and P-92, while those for the
CGB specimens were factors of 1 to 2 per 50 mils.
The average slopes for 14%Ba were a factor of
100 per 50 mils, while the CGB slopes were fac-
tors of 10 to 20 per 50 mils.

than those for 89Sr, although both have rare-gas
precursors of similar half-life. This suggests that
137Cs itself is mobile in graphite, as was pre-
viously inferred.

Pyrolytic Graphite Concentration Profiles. —
These profiles are of interest since pyrolytic
graphite represents the ultimate in decreasing the
porosity of graphite. The density of the specimen
used (P-103) was 2.225 g/cc. In accordance with
expectations, the penetration of all fission products
in the direction perpendicular to the graphite
planes was greatly reduced. All of the profiles
except those of 8°Sr and 14%Ba were essentially
identical, showing an initial steep drop of three
to five orders of magnitude in 7 mils, then leveling
out. The drop was even steeper than indicated
here since the first cut was excessively heavy,
with a thickness of 4.5 mils (due to difficulty in
locating the surface with the milling cutter). The
concentrations at which the profiles leveled out
were consistently lower by as much as two orders
of magnitude than the lowest concentrations in the
CGB profiles.
The 89Sr and !4°Ba profiles, shown in Fig. 11.8,
also differed markedly from the corresponding CGB
profiles. The latter for 89Sr leveled out at about
10!! dis min—! g—!, while the pyrolytic graphite
profile was still decreasing at 50 mils depth at a
concentration of 7.6 x 10° dis min—! g—!. For
140B5, the concentrations in CGB decreased from
the surface value of 2 x 10!! dis min—?! g—! only
about an order of magnitude to the value at a depth
of 50 mils. The span for '4°Ba in pyrolytic
graphite was more than four orders of magnitude,
and the initial value was lower (because of the
thick first sample). Another curious fact shown
clearly in Fig. 11.8 is that the 8°9Sr and '#°Ba
profiles were practically superimposed on each
other. For all other specimens examined, the
140Ba showed a distinctly steeper concentration
gradient than 8°Sr. The behavior in pyrolytic
graphite suggests that diffusion of the rare-gas
precursors may not be the mechanism by which
these nuclides penetrate pyrolytic graphite in the
direction perpendicular to the graphite planes.
This idea is supported by the fact that the con-
centrations of the noble metals in disintegrations
per minute per gram were all substantially higher
than those for 89Sr and !14%Ba at deep (20 to 50
mils) penetration. The reverse was true for all
other graphites examined. The impermeability of
pyrolytic graphite fuel particle coatings to fission
gases is well known.

For the pyrolytic graphite specimen, concentra-
tion profiles were also determined in the direction
parallel to the graphite planes (narrow face). For
all nuclides except 8°Sr and '*°Ba, the profiles
were qualitatively similar to those for CGB speci-
mens, usually somewhat steeper and often reaching
lower concentrations at the deeper levels. For
the noble metals and °3Zr the parallel (narrow
face) profiles showed similar initial slopes and
slightly higher final (40 to 50 mils) concentrations
than the perpendicular (wide face) profiles. For
89 Sr, 140By, 141Ce, 144Ce, and !3!] the narrow
face profiles were much more like CGB profiles
than like the wide face ones (i.e., less steep
slopes and much higher final concentrations).

The curves for 89Sr and !4%Ba shown in Fig. 11.8
show clearly the difference in diffusion behavior

in the parallel and perpendicular directions. In

the parallel direction the slopes are distinctly
higher than for CGB graphite but do not approach
the extreme behavior in the perpendicular direction.

Also, the usual difference in slopes for 82Sr and
149Ba is observed. It seems clear that in the
parallel direction we are dealing again with the
diffusion of rare-gas precursors. A final conclusion
may be drawn from the above observations that the
diffusion of 89Sr, 149Ba, 141Ce, 144Ce, and 131]
in graphite depended much more on the presence of
porosity than did the diffusion of the noble metals
and °°Zr. Since the analytical data for '**Ce
were often questionable and showed much scatter,
its placement in the above grouping is in some
doubt.

Poco Graphite Concentration Profiles. — This
variety of graphite was included because of its
resistance to radiation damage and because its
structure varied from the CGB structure in the
opposite way from pyrolytic graphite. Poco
graphite has relatively large pores of a uniform
diameter and is isotropic in all its physical proper-
ties. Concentration profiles were determined from
two faces of the same specimen.

The species °?Mo, 193Ru, !°%Ru, 95Nb, and 95Zr
had profiles qualitatively similar to those for CGB,
with steep initial drops of several orders of mag-
nitude in a few mils and then a sharp transition to
a less steep slope. The profiles from the two
faces did not duplicate themselves any more pre-
cisely than for CGB graphite. The profiles from
the narrow face were usually slightly steeper at
deep penetrations, started at higher initial con-
centrations, and dropped to lower final concentra-
tions.

The '32Te and !2°Te profiles were distinctly
different from those in CGB graphite, with much
shorter initial drops and less steep internal slopes
which were nearly straight lines (log concentra-
tion vs depth).

The profiles for 89Sr dropped slightly for 2 mils,
then leveled out at 8 x 101% and 7 x 10'° dis min—!
g~ ! for the wide and narrow faces respectively.
These are close to the level found for CGB graph-
ite. Both #%Ba profiles behaved similarly, giving
flat tails at 3 x 1019 dis min—! g—!. In CGB
graphite this concentration was observed in the
linear range of the profiles at depths of 20 to 30
mils. The relatively large pores of Poco graphite
are undoubtedly responsible for the unique flat-
ness of these Ba profiles, but it is not clear why
the profiles for CGB should start at a higher level
before crossing those for Poco graphite.

The !'41Ce profiles for Poco were markedly
different from those for CGB graphite. The initial
drops were much steeper and the linear tails were
much less steep than for CGB graphite. The final
concentration was higher for Poco graphite. The
linear tails are probably characteristic of Xe pre-
cursor diffusion and should be flatter for the
larger pores of Poco graphite. The diffusion
mechanism responsible for the initial slope must
be faster in CGB graphite. As discussed above,
the !44Ce profiles for Poco graphite were inter-
mediate between the two types observed for CGB
graphite.

The 311 behavior in Poco graphite was within
the considerable range of behavior observed for
the several CGB profiles. The profiles were not
nearly identical for the two sides of this supposedly
isotropic graphite. The initial slope was much
steeper for the narrow face profile. The final
slopes were downward like Y-9 but very much un-
like X-13 narrow face.

The discussion of diffusion of fission products
into Poco graphite may be summarized by stating
that smaller differences were observed between
Poco and CGB graphite than might have been
expected from the appreciable differences in the
graphite structure.

Overall Deposition on Graphite Surfaces. — For
most of the practical uses of the data on penetra-
tion of fission products into graphite, the shape
of the concentration profiles is of less significance
than the total amounts deposited on or in the
graphite. Since in most cases the bulk of the
nuclide is deposited within a few mils of the
graphite surface, the total depositions are reported
in terms of disintegrations per minute per square
centimeter of graphite surface. The activities
were calculated back to the time of shutdown of
the MSRE before the removal of the surveillance
specimen package (1 AM, March 25, 1968). The
disintegrations per minute per square centimeter
unit may be converted to atoms per square centi-
meter by dividing by the decay constant of the
particular nuclide (in minutes—1).

The number of disintegrations per minute in each
milled sample of graphite was obtained by multi-
plying the analytically reported disintegrations
per minute per gram by the sample weight. The
disintegrations per minute for the ten cuts from a
particular surface were summed, then divided by
the sampled area to obtain the total disintegrations
per minute per square centimeter. In many cases
the first few cuts contained 99% of the nuclide,
and the contributions of deeper cuts could be
neglected. In the case of 89Sr and other species
with flat concentration profiles, the calculated
totals were low, since they did not include the
significant quantities at depths below 50 mils (the
maximum depth of sampling of each graphite sur-
face). The only cases where the error is signifi-
cant are for 89Sr in most specimens and for !*%Ba
in Poco graphite. In the cases where only a single
50-mil-deep cut was made, the number of disinte-
grations per minute per square centimeter was
simply calculated by multiplying disintegrations
per minute per gram by the sample weight and
dividing by the sampled area.

The surface concentration results obtained in
this way are shown in Table 11.1, which also
lists the sample distance from the bottom of the
core, the type of graphite, and the exposure in
megawatt-hours. This mass of data is more
easily digested in graphical form. The surface
concentration of each nuclide is plotted against
distance from the bottom of the core in Figs. 11.9
to 11.13.

A gratifying aspect of the results in this sum-
marized form is that the scatter between speci-
mens was not so wide as might have been guessed
from the widely differing concentration profiles.

A number of regularities added credibility to the
results. The average agreement between wide and
narrow faces for the same specimen was well with-
in a factor of 2. At a given core location, the
average agreement between all types of CGB
graphite (untreated, impregnated, and doubly ex-
posed) was again within a factor of 2. For the
three isotopic pairs ('*?Te and '2°Te, !'°3Ru and
106Ry, 141Ce and 144Ce) the deposition results
were nicely parallel when plotted as a function of
core location.

Examination of the plots reveals that there were
two different patterns of deposition behavior with
respect to core locations. For the data points for
all types of CGB graphite, the deposition of °°Mo,
95SNb, 95Zr, 149Ba, 141Ce, and !**Ce increased
by a factor of about 3 from the bottom of the core
to the middle, then decreased by a somewhat
larger factor to low values for the specimens at
the top of the core. This humped pattern was not
observed for the other six fission products. The
most obvious parameter which varies with the core

125

position in a similar humped pattem is the neutron
flux. It is conceivable that flux-dependent proces-
ses like fission recoil might drive some fission
products into the graphite, but it is not clear why
only half the nuclides should be affected by it.

The deposition on the doubly exposed CGB
specimens (8000 to 64,000 Mwhr) was not signifi-
cantly different from that for the CGB specimens
exposed only during the last 32,000 Mwhr. How-
ever, the deposition of most nuclides on the
doubly exposed specimen at the top of the core
(MR-10) was usually slightly lower than on any
other specimen. The Ru values were slightly
lower for the doubly exposed specimens, but not
significantly so. It might indeed have been ex-
pected that the 1.06-year-half-life !?°Ru would
have accumulated to a greater extent for the
longer exposures. The deposition of long-lived
144Ce (285-day half-life) also showed no increase
with longer exposure. For nuclides with half-
lives short compared with the exposure times, the
material deposited during the first exposure would
have decayed away before the end of the second
exposute. The lack of increased deposition for
long-lived species for longer exposures possibly
implies that early deposits slough off as new
material deposits. Another optimistic interpreta-
tion of the behavior is that deposition rates
gradually decreased with time.

It was disappointing that the total deposition of
all nuclides on impregnated CGB graphite was not
significantly lower than on untreated CGB graphite,
even though the impregnated CGB concentration
profiles often showed steeper initial slopes. How-
ever, the uniform behavior of all types of CGB
graphite provided a convenient reference curve for
comparison with the deposition on Poco and pyro-
lytic graphite.

It was expected that deposition on pyrolytic
graphite, particularly in the direction perpendicular
to the graphite planes, would be low compared
with deposition on CGB. The plots show that this
is true for 132Te, 129Te, 89Sr, 140Ba, 141Ce,
and 1311, but not for °°Mo, !°3Ru, 19¢Ru, ?5Nb,
957, and '44Ce. The species with low deposition
are those which appeared to diffuse as if they
or their precursors were gaseous. The others
usually had very steep initial concentration pro-
files and behaved as if gaseous transport or
porosity were not involved in their mobility. Cor-
respondingly, the most nonmobile of the latter

group, 2°Mo, !'93Ru, !96Ru, and ?5Nb, actually
showed more deposition in the perpendicular
direction than in the direction parallel to the
graphite planes. For the others the reverse was
true, particularly for the most ‘“gaseous’ types,
89Sr and !4°Ba.

The deposition results on Poco graphite were
rather puzzling. The deposition of 132Te, 12°Te,
and !31] was higher than the CGB norm, but the

. other nuclides showed deposition in line with that
on CGB. Since the concentration profile of 14°Ba

. in Poco graphite was flatter than for CGB, '*°Ba
’ would be in the group with Te and I if the deposi-

tion calculation included the material at depths
greater than 50 mils. The same cannot be defi-

nitely stated for 89Sr, since the profiles in CGB
were also flat. The low deposition of 89Sr and
141Ce on Poco graphite is not explained.

On the average, then, the type of graphite ap-
peared to have relatively small effect on surface
deposition. It appears hardly worth while to
attempt to develope a more impervious graphite
from the standpoint of decreasing surface deposi-
tion. On the other hand, the more permeable Poco
type of graphite appeared to be nearly as satis-
factory as CGB as far as surface deposition was
concemed. Except for the !35Xe problem, it
might therefore be possible to relax the permea-
bility specifications in developing molten-salt
reactor graphites for other desirable physical and
nuclear characteristics.
132

The last row in Table 11.1 gives the average
deposition for all nuclides on all types of CGB
specimens (untreated, impregnated, and doubly
exposed). Since there were four specimens near
the top, nine near the middle, and four near the
bottom, the averages are not too seriously
weighted by the values for a particular axial re-
gion of the core. However, the averages represent
only the axial region of the core. For the species
which seem to show a flux dependence, the
averages over the whole core would be expected to
be considerably lower.

Diffusion and Deposition of Uranium in Graphite. -
The presence of uranium in graphite to any appreci-
able extent would indicate an instability of the fuel
salt and possibly cause chemical damage to the
graphite. Also, if substantial concentration of 235U
were present in graphite during irradiation, fission
products might be bomn inside the graphite.

Uranium-235 concentrations were detemmined for
more than half of the milled graphite samples by
the delayed neutron counting method. All of the
deep-cut samples were analyzed, and complete
profiles were determined for both faces of the
pyrolytic graphite specimen and for the wide faces
of the impregnated specimens P-77 and P-92. Six
cuts (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10) were analyzed for
specimen P-58 (wide face), Y-9 (wide face),

Poco (both faces), and X-13 (both faces).

Concentration profiles for both faces of the
pyrolytic graphite and for the wide face of CGB
specimen Y-9 are shown in Fig. 11.14. The pene-
tration of 235U into pyrolytic graphite in the
direction perpendicular to the graphite planes is
distinctly less than for CGB graphite, but the con-
centrations at a given penetration differ only by a
factor of about 5. The profile for penetration in
the parallel direction in pyrolytic graphite is
about midway between the other two curves.

The two Poco profiles agreed very well with
each other and were about 20% lower than the Y-9
curve except for the first cut sample on the wide
face. This had the highest individual 235U con-
centration of any of the samples, 250 ppm, which
may have been due to a particle of fuel salt on the
specimen surface. The two X-13 (doubly exposed
graphite) curves agreed poorly with each other.

The wide face profile started at 100 ppm and de-
creased only to 6.5 ppm at 50 mils. This was the
only instance where the final concentration sig-
nificantly exceeded 1 ppm. The narrow face pro-

file of X-13 started at 166 ppm and dropped
steeply to 1 ppm at 15 mils, The P-58 profile was
lower than the Y-9 profile by about 40% over its
whole course. The 135U profiles in impregnated
graphite specimens P-77 and P-92 were similar to
each other and matched the Y-9 curve over most
of its length.

In most cases the total range of variation of the
235U concentration in 50 mils penetration was
less than two orders of magnitude. This moderate
slope indicates a higher mobility for uranium in
graphite than for most fission products. The
profiles were all rather similar except that for
diffusion in pyrolytic graphite perpendicular to the
planes. All but one of the profiles showed a
leveling off at 1 ppm at deep penetrations. If this
concentration persisted throughout the thickness
of the graphite moderator, it would represent only
1 g of 235U per 1000 kg of graphite and would
cause no chemical or nuclear problems.

The presence of uranium deep in the graphite
led, naturally, to the speculation that some of the
fission products found in the graphite might have
been bom there by fission of some of this uranium
rather than by diffusing in from the fuel salt.
Even before a quantitative comparison was made,
it was obvious that the slopes of the concentration
profiles for the fission products and for uranium
were quite different. However, it was of interest
to see whether intemal fission might account for
the flat tail regions of the profiles, and the data
existed in convenient form for a quantitative com-
parison, so it was carried out. A computer calcu-
lation had been made of the concentration of all
fission products in the MSRE salt on the assump-
tion that none of the nuclides left the fuel salt
after birth. The calculation takes into account
the power history of the MSRE, dilution by flush
salt and the heel in the drain tank, etc. The
computed fission product concentration per gram
of salt (in disintegrations per minute per gram) at
the time of the March 25,:1968, shutdown was con-
verted to disintegrations per minute per gram of
uranium by multiplying by the known number of
grams of salt per gram of uranium. The disinte-
grations per minute per gram of uranium value was

133

corrected for flux by multiplying by the known
ratio of the flux at each specimen position to the
average flux used in the computation. The cor-
rected disintegrations per minute per gram of
uranium value when multiplied by the number of
grams of uranium per gram of graphite for each
analyzed sample could be compared with the ob-
served value for that sample. This method of
calculation assumes that the uranium was in the
graphite for the total power history; thus the
calculated values should be high by at least a
factor of 2.

Rather than show the results of this comparison
in detail (over 1800 numbers), the results are
summarized in a chart showing which milled cuts
gave calculated values equal to or greater than the
observed values (Table 11.2). The first point
which stood out was that the calculated values
were much smaller than the observed values for
the large majority of cases. For the first cut,
the ratio of observed to calculated was usually
greater than 103 and fell off to lower values for
the deeper cuts. The calculated ?>Nb concentra-
tions were in all cases much less than the ob-
served values, suggesting a high independent
mobility of °5Nb in graphite. The observed #°Sr
and !49Ba values were also higher than the cal-
culated ones, except for pyrolytic graphite in the

direction perpendicular to the graphite planes.
This behavior squares with the observed extra
mobility of the nuclides with rare-gas precursors
except for diffusion perpendicular to the planes of
pyrolytic graphite. For the remaining isotopes,
the calculated concentrations often equaled or
exceeded the observed concentrations in the
deeper cuts, but the ratio of calculated to ob-
served concentrations usually was near 1 and
seldom exceeded 3. Pyrolytic graphite was ex-
ceptional in this regard, with some of the deep-cut
ratios exceeding 10 for 25Zr, 89Sr, *4%Ba, and
141Ce. This may indicate that it took a longer
time for uranium to diffuse deep into pyrolytic
graphite than into the other graphites. Table 11.2
shows that the calculated concentrations of most
isotopes exceeded the observed values more fre-
quently for pyrolytic graphite (perpendicular) than
for any other specimen. This of course is con-
sistent with the concentration profiles. They
showed unusually steep initial drops for all fission
products, but the uranium profiles were not as
different from those for other specimens. The
table also shows that the calculated values ex-
ceeded the observed values most frequently for

103Ry, 196Ry, 95Zr, and !#%Ce. These all happen
to be species which showed little indication of
independent mobility (or ‘‘gaseous’’ behavior) in
the concentration profiles. For these species,
then, it is possible that the flat tails at the deep
ends of their concentration profiles may be
accounted for by fission of uranium already in the
graphite. Iodine-131 may also belong in this
group. However, the profiles near the surface
require a different diffusion mechanism. For the
other species, different mechanisms are required
to account for the whole course of the profiles.

The uranium concentration profiles (Fig. 11.14)
show that a considerable fraction of the total
uranium in the graphite is concentrated near the
surface. It is, therefore, meaningful to calculate
surface concentrations of uranium, as was done
for the fission products. These values are shown
in Table 11.1, last column, and are plotted as a
function of core position in Fig. 11.15. The points
for all types of CGB graphite are in a narrow band
covering a factor of 2 in concentration except for
a single point that corresponds to the unusual
profile for X -13 wide face previously discussed.

In general, there appears to be no significant effect
of impregnation, double exposure, or core location.

One of the points for Poco graphite is outside the
CGB band; this is due to the previously discussed
single high value for the first cut of Poco wide
face. The total deposition on pyrolytic graphite
for diffusion perpendicular to the graphite planes
(PY1) is about ¥ of the CGB norm. The deposi-
tion on the other face of pyrolytic graphite is not .
significantly lower than on CGB. In summary,
the deposition and diffusion of uranium in graphite
appear to depend little on graphite structure and
porosity; even in the most impermeable direction
in pyrolytic graphite, the uranium concentrations
are about % of those in more pervious graphites.

The last row in Table 11.1 indicates that the
average uranium deposition on CGB graphite
amounts to 0.800 ug/cm?. Multiplying this by the
total graphite surface area in the MSRE, 2 x 106
cm?, the total surface deposition of 235U on the
graphite in the MSRE is 1.6 g.

Spectrographic Analyses of Graphite Samples. —
Spectrographic analyses of the dissolutions of the
graphite samples were requested on each of the
deep-cut (50 mils) samples and on the first two
cuts on the other specimens. Analyses were made
for Be, Zr, and Li, in the hope of detemmining the
extent of surface contamination by bulk fuel (or .
flush) salt. Analyses were also made for Mo, Fe,
Cr, and Ni after concentration of the original very -
dilute graphite solution.
The spectrographic results are shown in Table
11.3, in the form of micrograms of each element per
square centimeter of graphite surface sampled.
The data for Zr, Li, and Fe were not included,
since they showed too much scatter to be usefully
interpreted.

The Mo results are of most interest, since they
furnish a check on the conclusions regarding Mo
deposition drawn from the observations on ?°Mo.
No other fission product was detected spectro-
graphically. It may be noted that Mo deposition
was detected only on the specimens near the
middle of the core. (The samples in Table 11.3
are listed in order of distance from the bottom of
the core.) The average of the Mo values listed is
10 pg/cm?. It may be easily calculated that 136 g
of stable Mo nuclides were formed during 32,000 -
Mwhr of MSRE operation. If the percentage of this
Mo depositing on the 2 x 10 cm? of core graphite .
is the same as for °°Mo, 9.0% (see Table 11.4), -
then there should be 6 ug/cm? of stable Mo on the
graphite. This agreement with the spectrographic

value is gratifying, particularly when it is recalled
that the deposition of ??Mo was higher near the
middle of the core than near the extremes. The
agreement implies that the fraction of each Mo
nuclide deposited on graphite is the same, or more
broadly that the deposition rates for Mo and
other Mo isotopes are the same.

The Be results showed that only a few micro-
grams of fuel salt or flush salt per square centi-
meter adhered to the sampled graphite surfaces. It
is interesting that the deposition of Cr and Ni was
detected only near the middle of the core, as for
Mo. Comparing the quantities of Cr, Ni, and Mo, it
appears unlikely that the Mo which was deposited
was carried by larger particles of Ni or of an alloy
of Ni and Cr.

Analysis of Hastelloy N Surveillance Specimens.
— The deposition of fission products on Hastelloy
N is of concern principally because of the decay
heating problem on metal surfaces of an MSBR in
case of coolant system failure. Previous results
showed a great deal of scatter, and more accurate
data were desired to estimate the seriousness of
the decay heating problem.

The Hastelloy N specimens on which fission
product deposition was measured in the first two
surveillance packages were sections of the perfo-
rated tube in which the graphite specimens were
contained. Since the tube was to be reused this
time, we used instead sections of the ¥ -in.-diam
Hastelloy N tube used to contain the dosimeter
wires. This tube extended from the bottom to the
top of the package (62 in.) and probably was a
better metal specimen on which to observe deposi-
tion, since the surface was relatively smooth and

did not contain holes in which droplets of salt
might be trapped. Also, the salt flow pattern
past the smooth surface was probably more typical
of that for other reactor metal surfaces than that
near a perforated sheet.

The 1/B-in. tube was segmented so as to obtain
seven equally spaced 3-in.-long sections from the
bottom to the top of the core. This spacing had

of the core. The other nuclides showed definite
maxima near the middle of the core, with the
lowest values near the top of the core. Itis
possible that humped profiles were produced in
every case by fission recoil, but were over-
shadowed by heavy deposition from the salt in the
cases where level profiles were obtained. In pre-
vious surveillance tests,® the results showed much
more scatter, and trends as a function of core
location were difficult to discern. Previous re-
sults also showed distinctly more deposition of
all species, by an average factor of about 3.
Certainly this discrepancy is at least partly due
to the different type of Hastelloy N specimen
analyzed in the current test. It was mentioned
above that the 7 -in.-diam tubing was probably a
sample more representative of the metal surfaces
in the MSRE. The larger number of samples and
the much better quality of the analytical results
also argue in favor of the current test as a better
measure than previous tests of fission product
deposition on MSRE metal surfaces.

For the nuclides whose profiles were level over
the length of the core, there is no problem in
choosing an average value for deposition. For
those with maxima in the middle of the core, it is
likely that the lower values at the inlet or outlet
of the core were more typical of deposition on the
reactor metal surface outside the core. However,
the nuclides which showed maxima were also
those with low deposition on Hastelloy N, so the
averages shown in the last row of Table 11.5
were conservatively calculated using data from
all seven specimens.

Fission Product Distribution in the MSRE. —
Using the new averages for deposition on CGB
graphite and on Hastelloy N, together with the
previously reported data for the amounts of each
nuclide in the fuel salt and in the cover gas in
March 1968, a new material balance was calculated,
as shown in Table 11.4. The total inventory of
each fission product in the MSRE on March 25,
1968, was taken from a computer calculation
using a recently developed program.’ The revised
estimate of 8 0 Mw as full power for the MSRE was
used in the computation.

6MSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Aug. 31, 1967,
ORNL-4191, p. 127.

7Elvin L.ee, unpublished work.

The material balance in Table 11.4 differs from
the previous one® mainly in that the fractions of
noble metal fission products deposited on Hastel-
loy N are considerably lower. This is desirable
from the standpoint of the fission product heating
problem, but undesirable from the standpoint of
removing noble metal neutron poisons from the
reactor core. The principal changes in the
graphite data are for 89Sr and '4%Ba. This is
because their concentration profiles were more
level in the current test and samples as deep as
50 mils were included in the deposition calcula-
tions. The number for 82Sr would increase sub-
stantially if estimated amounts still deeper in
the graphite were included in the calculation.

The pattem of behavior of the noble metals was
not uniform. The deposition of ?°Nb on graphite
was distinctly heavier than on Hastelloy N, and
only 11% was lost to the cover gas. The deposi-
tion of 9°Mo, 132Te, and '?9Te was heavier on
Hastelloy N than on graphite, and about 50% was
lost to the cover gas. The deposition of the Ru
isotopes on metal and graphite was comparable
and rather low (3 to 5%), and a large percentage
of each was lost to the cover gas.

The total material balance (last column) was
much nearer 100% for each nuclide than previous
balances. The fair approximation to a 100%
balance in most cases is not to be taken as a true
measure of the reliability of the percentages
listed. At least three-fourths of the percentages
listed are uncertain by a factor of about 2.

Conclusions. — The results reported in this
section indicate that some progress has been
made toward the objective of reliable quantitative
information on fission product deposition on
graphite and on Hastelloy N. Although the con-
centration profiles of fission products in graphite
showed considerable variations in shape for dif-
ferent specimens of CGB graphite and even for
different faces of the same specimen, the total
deposition showed much less scatter, usually less
than a factor of 2 at a given core location. It is
believed that the agreement obtained was not
limited by the experimental techniques used but
rather by the variability in the graphite itself.
Even Poco graphite occasionally stowed differ-
ences in diffusion and deposition behavior between

8MSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Aug. 31, 1967,
ORNL-4191, p. 101.

"
two faces of the same specimen. It is therefore
unlikely that the reproducibility of deposition
measurements in graphite can be significantly im-
proved over its current status.

The quantitative data for deposition of fission
products on Hastelloy N are less reliable. Depo-
sition on smooth Hastelloy N tubing was lower
than in previously reported values for perforated
Hastelloy N sheets by factors from 2 to 10,
averaging about 3. It is believed that differences
in surface roughness and perhaps in fuel salt
turbulence near the metal surfaces may account
for the discrepancies. The deposition data on
the smooth tubing when plotted against sample
location gave either level or humped profiles with
small variations between adjacent sample points.
The regularity and smoothness of the profiles
suggest that the precision of the data is well
within a factor of 2. It is not possible with data
from only one test to estimate the absolute reli-
ability of the deposition data. However, for depo-
sition on smooth surfaces of similar roughness to
that of 1/8-ir1. Hastelloy N tubing, the data reported
for the latter type of specimen are to be preferred
over previous data.

11.2 FISSION PRODUCT PROFILES IN THREE
MSRE GRAPHITE SURVEILLANCE SPECIMENS

D. R. Cuneo H. E. Robertson

During this period, three graphite surveillance
specimens removed from the MSRE during the

141

March 25, 1968, shutdown were sampled for fission
product distribution by a previously described
method.® Two 0.305-in.-diam cores were obtained
from a pyrolytic graphite specimen and one core
each from specimens designated as P-55 (unim-
pregnated CGB) and V-28 (impregnated CGB).
These specimens had been exposed to MSRE fuel
salt for 8.0 Mw of operation. Small increments of
these cores were removed by precision grinding,
and fission product distributions across the cores
were determined by gamma spectrometry using a
germanium crystal to count individual activities in
the graphite powder. Generally, we confirmed
findings of the previously reported fission product
distribution in specimens removed at the May 1967
shutdown. We have perhaps leamned an explanation
for the anomaly reported earlier when we found an
increase in fission product concentrations from

a specimen surface to a depth of several mils.
Comparison of results for the impregnated and
unimpregnated CGB material shows that impregna-
tion of the type used for specimen V-28 is not of
value in inhibiting penetration of fission products
into CGB graphite. As we recognized eatly in
these investigations, effects of cracks or voids in
a specimen can cause great uncertainty in interpre-
tation of results.

11.2.1 Pyrolytic Graphite

The cores, obtained by boring through the
graphite surveillance specimens perpendicular
to the surface exposed to MSRE fuel salt, were
difficult to obtain from the pyrolytic specimen.
This material is fabricated in layers and tends to
peel apart quite easily when worked after irradia-
tion at high temperature. We found that the first
core of pyrolytic graphite was missing within
some 25 mils of the end which was on the back,
or stagnant-salt, side of the specimen. The core
was intact, that is, full length, before transferring
from the hot cells to a vented glove box for
grinding. Because of the undetected loss of ~25
mils from one end of the core our last sample
was about 15 mils thick. Generally we have ob-
tained numerous samples of 1-mil thickness in
approaching a hot surface. This particular powder
sample was so radioactive that the spectrometer

MSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Feb. 29, 1968,
ORNL-4254, p. 115.
142

would not accept the sample even at maximum
distance until several weeks of cooling beyond
the approximately 3 weeks of cooling needed for
the other samples from this core. Because powder
samples from this core were counted (gamma
spectrometry) soon after reactor shutdown (with
the above exception) it was possible to look for
77-hr 132Te, It was found to exist from 135 mils
from the hot salt surface to the back side of the
specimen.

A second core from the pyrolytic specimen was
drilled and sampled. The results of analyses are
shown in Fig. 11.18. In all cases in this discus-
sion the numerical values given for nuclides are
calculated back to the time of MSRE shutdown,
March 25, 1968. The left ordinate represents the
specimen surface which was exposed to free-
flowing fuel salt. The right ordinate is the surface
which was exposed only to salt which seeped
between specimen surfaces. All four of the nu-
clides found are seen to have a lower concentra-
tion for the first mil of the free-flowing MSRE salt-
exposed surface. Relatively brief circulation of
barren salt following reactor shutdown may have
lowered fission product concentrations in the first
mil of graphite, although we will see below that
this effect is not noticed for the CGB specimens;
if it is real, it is peculiar to the pyrolytic material.
Following the usual sharp drop in concentration
for the first few mils of depth, we see the sur-
prising rise in concentrations for the three nuclides
which have persisted as deep as 15 mils. (The
95Zr disappeared below 6 mils.) Between 15 and
30 mils, the '*1Ce concentration increases by a
factor of 5, and the !93Ru and 95Nb increase an
order of magnitude each. By a depth of 45 to 50
mils, the concentrations are back on their original
curves. Almost certainly, this finding would be
explainable by a crack or pocket into which a
channel to the surface allowed salt seepage.
viously,? we reported a similar situation for a
core sample removed from a specimen from which

Pre-

some 60 mils had been removed by milling. Re-
sampling of the same specimen in a different loca-
tion did not produce duplicate results. Again, we
find this to be true; the first core from this pyro-
lytic specimen did not show similar behavior be-
tween 15 and 45 mils; hence our belief that a
short localized crack could cause this result.

The persistence of the ?5Nb throughout the core
sample is interesting; it is not a fission product
and occurs only as a daughter of ?5Zr. Since no

95Zr was found beyond 6 mils, the ?5Nb must have
penetrated because of its existence as a different
species from the 95Zr.

11.2.2 Unimpregnated CGB (Specimen P.55)

The results of analyses from the P-55 specimen
are given in Fig. 11.19. Seven nuclides were found
to varying degrees of penetration and concentra-

tion. Points of interest are discussed below.

1. Cesium-137: Virtually uniform concentration
across the specimen with the exception of a
few mils near each surface, with an apparent
real dip in the curve 10 mils from the left
ordinate.

Zirconium-95: Steepest gradient of the seven
nuclides; disappeared 85 mils from the left
ordinate. Low level in 135-to-160-mil sample,
then reappeared 13 mils from right ordinate.
Barium-140: Not found in the pyrolytic samples;
quite evident here, having flattest curve with
exception of 137Cs.

Cerium-141, -144: The !41Ce isotope is seen
to have penetrated to a greater depth from the
free-flowing salt surface (left ordinate) than
the !44Ce, actually being found in all samples
except the 85-to-110-mil one. As noted previ-
ously,? 141Ce has '4!Ba (18 min) and '4!La
(3.7 hr) precursors, while all precursors of
144Ce are ““short’’ only. % Since we find no
144Ce beyond 15 mils from the left ordinate,
perhaps the difference in precursors for the
two cerium isotopes is a clue to the mechanism
of cerium migration in some types of graphitic
structures.

Niobium-95: As in the case of the pyrolytic
graphite, 9>Nb was found in every sample
despite the lack of its precursor, ?5Zr, in many
of them.

Ruthenium-103: Found in all samples.

11.2.3 Impregnated CGB (Specimen V-28)

This specimen was slightly more than twice the
thickness of the P-55 specimen discussed above.

DEPTH IN GRAPHITE {mils)

Fig. 11.20. Fission Product Distribution in Impregnated CGB (V-28) Graphite Specimen Irradiated in MSRE

Cycle Ending March 25, 1968.

However, the bulk of all nuclides, with the ex-
ception of 137Cs, was found to occur in the first
few mils from the surfaces, so that the total num-
ber of atoms of nuclide found in going from one
surface through to the opposite side is not ap-
preciably affected by doubling the thickness of
the specimen.

The impregnation of a CGB graphite specimen
was done to test its effect on fission product
penetration. The results of analyses for 0 to 70
mils from the free-flowing salt surface of the
specimen and from 340 mils out to the back (stag-

nant salt) surface are shown in Fig. 11.20. The
nuclide concentrations omitted for ease of illus-
tration (from 70 to 340 mils) are flat over this
interval. Comparison with results in Fig. 11.19
shows that fission product penetration was not
appreciably inhibited by the shallow!! impregna-
tion used for this specimen.

Further comparisons between results reported in
Figs. 11.19 and 11.20 show that, in general,

1lpersonal communication, W. H. Cook to F. F.
Blankenship, May 27, 1968.
fission product concentrations in the two pieces
of CGB graphite were similar. One exception was
that 25Zr was found as deep as 285 mils in the
V-28 specimen, but only to a depth of 95 mils in
the P-55 specimen, both measurements being from
the free-flowing salt surface. Another difference
between the two is noted for 144Ce; apparently
this isotope penetrated the impregnated specimen
more easily than the unimpregnated one. In the
impregnated specimen it is apparent that all the
fission products found, with the exception of
137Cs, are grouped within an order of magnitude
(10!3 to 10** atoms of nuclide per cubic centi-
meter of graphite per mil of depth), while there is
considerably more scatter for the other CGB
specimen.

During grinding of the core from this specimen
we noted a crack across the face of the core fol-
lowing removal of 1 mil between 4 and 5 mils from
the back (stagnant salt) surface. This was evident
for two or three more mils in approach to the sur-
face and most likely accounts for the sharp drop
in nuclide concentrations near the surface. This
conclusion, of course, presupposes that the crack
was empty, which could reasonably be expected
since loose material would fall out easily from a
crack that opened out at the surface.

11.2.4 Overall Results

In Table 11.6 we find a summation of atoms from
1 cm? of specimen surface through to the other
side of the specimen, as represented by a core
0.305 in. in diameter., Data previously reported?
for the May 1967 specimens are repeated to allow
comparisons with the March 1968 specimens. As
noted, the first core taken from the pyrolytic
graphite was missing one hot surface: that sur-
face in contact with the stagnant MSRE fuel salt,
The amount of ?3Zr is seen to be far less in the
more recent samples, while the °5Nb is larger.
Values for 1%3Ru are all similar. Ruthenium-106
was detected in only one surface of pyrolytic
graphite, to a depth of 15 mils. Except for the
pyrolytic specimen, which contained virtually no
137Cs, values are identical. The 141:144Ce
values are fairly comparable. As expected, 14%Ba
was quite mobile in the CGB material. We plan to
obtain a uranium profile on samples from the V-28
specimen to allow us to adjust the nuclide con-
centrations we found by the amounts that could

X-13 FOR FLUORINE AND LITHIUM

R. L. Macklin F. F. Blankenship
J. H. Gibbons E. Ricci -
T. H. Handley D. R. Cuneo

A cross section of CGB graphite removed from
the MSRE on March 25, 1968, after 58,000 Mwhr
exposure was moved across a beam of 2.06-Mev
protons collimated through a slit of 0.0075 cm
width. The protons were from the ORNL 3-Mv Van
de Graaff accelerator. Measurement of the result-
ing prompt gamma rays from '°F(p,ay)!®0 showed
that fluorine varied from 350 ppm near the surface
to 60 ppm near the center. Neutron yields from
7Li(p,n)"Be showed that lithium varied from 60 ppm
near the surface to 13 ppm at the center. The ob-
served ratio of fluorine to lithium was near that
characteristic of the MSRE fuel. The lithium and
fluorine concentrations did not show a simple de-
pendence on depth.

The method and apparatus were the same as
those described earlier,!? with minor adjustments .
of technique and data handling. A 3 x 3 in.
Nal(Tl) spectrometer with a 2.5-cm lead filter was .
used for the gamma-ray measurements.

An attempt to use a new standard of graphite
mixed with known amounts (in the ppm range) of
LiF was unsuccessful due to inhomogeneities
which caused yield changes of up to 100% for
changes in beam spot location of 0.0075 cm.
Thereafter, the standard used was a crystal of LiF.

The concentrations of lithium and fluorine in the
sample (X-13 from the middle of the core) showed
substantial variation and fluctuation from position
to position. The data presented (Figs. 11.21 and
11.22) are for a freshly abraded cross section
from a cored sample. This was prepared by care-
fully abrading away 5-15 mils. The motion
against the abrasive paper was kept parallel to
the surface exposed to fuel to avoid possible
carry-over of material from one depth to another.
The mass concentration ratio (Fig. 11.23) sug-
gested that much of the lithium and fluorine found
in the graphite came from bulk salt intrusion; this .

is in contrast to an earlier sample (No. Y-7) which
was withdrawn after 9 months reactor exposure, in
which progressive lithium enrichment (relative to
fluorine) with depth was found. !3 If this behavior
is typical, one should also find uranium concen-
tration (relative to fluorine or lithium) correspond-
ing to the molten salt. For fuel, the F~ to 235U
ratio is 44 and the Li* to 235U ratio is 7. As
shown in Figs. 11.18 and 11.19, there is somewhat
more uranium present in the graphite than expected
from the fuel composition. It should be kept in
mind, however, that while the uranium content was
determined from a bulk sampling, the lithium and
fluorine results were from a specific small sample
that could be different from the average. The
main difference in the lithium and fluorine results
for the two different exposures is a substantial
increase in fluorine, as shown in Figs. 11.24 and
11.25. Samples Y-7 and X-13 were comparable in
all respects except that X-13 received about twice
the exposure that Y-7 received.

The results are puzzling in that, in the absence
of radiation, a control specimen showed less pene-
tration of both salt and uranium by a factor of 100.
There is a possibility that the same mechanism
that apparently produced a fuel aerosol in the gas

having penetrated the graphite voids as an aerosol.

11.4 SURFACE PHENOMENA IN MOLTEN SALTS

H. W. Kohn F. F. Blankenship
Dispersions of metals of colloidal dimensions
have been prepared in lithium-beryllium fluoride
by three methods: reductive electrolysis, Bredig
arc, and ac electrolysis. Gold, titanium, niobium,
molybdenum, and nickel colloids have been pre-
pared. In the reductive electrolysis method, a dc
source is applied through a variable resistor
across two identical electrodes immersed in the
melt while the solution is swept with a hydrogen-
helium mixture. The idea is to reduce the metal
ions as fast as they are introduced into the solu-
tion. The Bredig arc method has been well de-
scribed; !4 we wish only to add that we were un-
able (using 110-v ac) to strike an arc in the solu-
tion. Apparently it has too high a conductivity.
Satisfactory results, however, were achieved by
striking an arc between one electrode and the
solution interface. Alternating-current electrolysis
gives by far the most stable sols and is surely the
most novel and interesting, although the mechanism
of formation by this method is still quite obscure.
We discovered it quite accidentally while running
the blank for the Bredig arc method. To do an
altemating-current electrolysis, one applies the

output of a 110-v Variac through a series resistor
across the electrolysis cell. The cell is (again)
two identical wires 1 to 1% cm apart immersed in
molten Li BeF,. Helium is usually swept through
the solution to provide both an inert atmosphere
and agitation. As the voltage is turned up, a

small current usually flows, and the solution be-
comes a bit clearer than it was. At higher voltages
bubbles form at the electrodes, and finally at still
higher voltages the solution turns dark.

None of these colloids were particularly stable,
but if the sol were filtered immediately after forma-
tion, most of the dark material readily passed a
sintered glass ‘“D’’ (5-p nominal pore size) filter.
Platinum and titanium sols coagulated readily in
less than 20 min. Nickel and niobium sols were
more stable, but they generally lasted less than
an hour. The molybdenum and gold sols were the
most stable. Gold formed a particularly satisfac-
tory sol since, due to the reddish-purple color,
we knew we were dealing with a metal sol. Sols
made by the reductive electrolysis method seemed
noticeably less stable than those made by the
other two methods.

Samples of the molybdenum sols were centrifuged
at high temperatures.!® After cooling, the end of
the frozen salt ingot was cut off and examined
microscopically and also subjected to electron
microscope examination. The ingots were also
analyzed spectroscopically. The usual molybdenum
content was 20 to 30 ppm overall; however, the
lower end of the centrifuged specimens often ran
as high as 50 ppm.

Table 11.7 shows the calculated efficacy of
high-temperature centrifugation at 530 ¢ and 750°K
for 1 hr for molybdenum particles in Li BeF,.

The three quantities calculated are: s, the dis-
tance traveled by a particle of radius r in 1 hr,
calculated from Stokes’ law; \/x_2, the displace-
ment of a particle of radius r due to Brownian
motion; and A, the height at which after infinite
time (sedimentation equilibrium) half the particles
will be below the height and half will be above.!®
Sedimentation equilibrium cannot be hoped for in
the currently available centrifuge because of
vibration. The table serves to show that centrifu-
gation cannot concentrate aggregates much less

than 1000 A across. We expected that the aggre-
gates would be flocs of smaller particles which
could be distinguished by electron microscopy.
The analysis of the top portions of the centrifuged
ingots showed either that many of the particles
were below this size or that there were some sol-
uble molybdenum compounds in these preparations.
The electron microscope picture showed that
reductive electrolysis produced irregular size
particles which varied from the smallest discern-
ible, ~200 A in diameter, to large square particles
15,000 A across. When the electrolysis was done
at higher current densities, the particles were
smaller and mote uniform. The Bredig arc method

gave a nicely uniform product, as shown in Fig.
11.26. Agglomerates about 1000 A across con-
sisted of individual particles 100 to 200 A across.
We obtained only one picture of the particles from
the ac electrolysis. It showed one agglomerate
about 10,000 A across. The individual particles
were again quite small, 100 to 200 A in diameter.
While we were unable to discem the electron
diffraction pattemn of molybdenum, we could es-
tablish that the small particles were not salt.
Based on past experience, the particles should
have been molybdenum.

Mechanisms whereby these colloids get into the
gas phase have also been studied. An extensive
literature search was completed and supplemented
by a scouting experiment. Generally, jet droplets
from bursting bubbles, which are an important
factor in entrainment, are one-tenth the volume of
the bubble and rise to considerable heights above
the liquid surface. We were able to show that this
height for a molten salt (LiNO_-KNO, eutectic)
was 10 cm, and further that the droplets would also
act as a surface microtome,!? skimming finely
divided carbon from the melt surface. The jet
droplet behavior of the salt melts was nicely ap-
proximated by a 50% glycerol-water mixture. An
ORNL report has been prepared on this subject.!®

system leaves the pure MoFs. Additional studies
of this process have revealed that the solid result-
ing from the disproportionation of MoF _ depends on
the pressure of MoF6 maintained in the reaction
vessel. If the MoF _pressure was kept in the
micron range, the solid produced was MoF _. If
much higher pressures, in the order of an atmos-
phere, were maintained, the solid product was
M0F4, which displays 260 values for the three most
intense x-ray diffraction peaks (copper radiation)

of 23.23, 24.71, and 25.31°. The x-ray diffraction
pattern for this material is very similar to that in-
correctly reported? !? for MoF | several years be-
fore a satisfactory preparation was studied.!!?
Analysis of the MoF , gave 55.9 wt % Mo and 44.0
wt % F, compared with calculated values of 55.8
and 44.2 respectively. The compound was found to
be stable for many days at a temperature of 200°C
and pressures in the micron range, but it decom-
posed at somewhat higher temperatures (<300°C) to
MoF3 and a volatile product. The results for tem-
peratures above 2000°C are somewhat uncertain be-
cause the Pyrex container was attacked by the flu-
orides. Accordingly, these stability studies must
be repeated in a metal container.

rides have been extended to the RuF family of
compounds. An attempt, in accordance with the

The compound was identified by its x-ray diffrac-
tion pattern.!®

It was indicated above that the products of an
MoF synthesis were unusually dependent on ex-
perimental conditions. Apparently the RuF and
MoF compounds are analogous in this respect.
The RuF , produced will be used in investigations
of the rate of removal of Ru3™ from molten 2LiF-
BeF and MSR fuels, paralleling the Mo?® * kinetic
studies.

12.1.2 Kinetic Behavior of MoF3 in Molten
2LiF-BeF2

Continued studies of the rate of removal of Mo3*
from molten 2LiF-BeF  have served to emphasize
the complexity of molybednum fluoride chemistry.
These experiments have shown that the order as
well as the rate of removal varies with the experi-
mental conditions. Figures 12.1 through 12.3 show

second-, first-, and half-order kinetics respectively.

The conditions of these experiments were: Fig.

12.3 — 500°C, 12 liters/ht helium flow, copper con-
tainer H  fired at 500°C.

It has become apparent that the initial removal
rate at 700° is strongly enhanced by the hydrogen
firing step, which was used on new batches but not
thereafter. This observation will require a reinter-
pretation of earlier data. Experiments without hy-
drogen firing will provide a better reference system
for kinetic studies involving MSR materials, since
the gas is not involved in the reactor chemistry.
The most stable conditions encountered thus far
are 500°C with a static helium atmosphere in which
the concentration of Mo3* dropped by a factor of 4
in 1400 hr. The previously reported® evidence that
Mo 3" was not removed from solution by reaction
with the copper container indicated that a dispro-
portionation reaction was involved.

It has been reported!! and we have confirmed by
x-ray diffraction that MoF3 decomposes in the tem-
perature range 500 to 700°C to form molybdenum
metal and a volatile product. It was also shown!
by electron probe analysis that a sample of 2LiF.
BeF, and MoF , heated to 700°C in a graphite con-
tainer under a helium atmosphere had molybdenum
metal on the helium-salt interface after cooling.
Since all of the intermediate-valence MoF (3 <
x < 6) compounds are thermally unstable in bulk at
temperatures well below 500 to 700°C, it was pro-
posed that the reaction 2M0F3 > Mo + MoF  oc-
curred. However, efforts to collect the volatile
species by trapping it in aqueous caustic solution
were unsuccessful.* More recently, efforts to de-
tect the volatile species under two different condi-
tions with a spectrophotometer!® were also unsuc-
cessful. In one case the spectrophotometric cell
was at room temperature, obviating the detection of
species not volatile at room temperature. It is
known from our own work® in cooperation with J. P.
Young that MoF_ does not have a high enough
vapor pressure at room temperature to be detected
in a 5-cm quartz cell by absorption spectroscopy.
In the second case a windowless cell was used.
The optical path was at melt temperature, but

clearly volatile material could easily escape from
the path. Mass spectrometric studies of pure MoF3
have shown? that the gas escaping from a Knudsen
cell in the temperature range 500 to 700°C was pre-
dominately MoF , with lesser amounts of both MoF
and M0F4. Also on opening the systems used for
the kinetic studies, a blue coating typical of MoF
hydrolysis product was found in the portion of the
gas outlet line that was warmer than room tempera-
ture. This observation suggests that a volatile mo-
lybdenum compound did escape from the melt, con-
densed at lower temperature in the hot line, and
hydrolyzed when the system was exposed to air at
the end of the run. Since the volatile species can-
not be MoF , we now believe that it is MoF, or
MoFS and that their low partial pressures, on the
order of 1 torr or less, either reduce their decompo-
sition rates or shift the chemical equilibria in their
favor, as indicated at even lower pressures by the
mass spectrometric studies. Further attempts to
identify these gases will involve collecting them
from hot exit lines rather than at room temperature
and monitoring LiF-BeFQ-MoF3 mixtures with the
mass spectrometer. Even though many details of
the behavior of Mo3 ¥ in molten 2LiF-BeF  are
pootly understood, the system is stable enough to
serve as a reference for kinetic studies involving
MSR fuels, graphite, and INOR-8 which we will now
run in parallel with studies of the simpler system.

12.2.1 Phase Relations in Fluoroborate Systems

Phase diagrams of the systems of principal in-
terest as possible coolants for molten-salt reactors
have been published,!?:2° but additional data have
been obtained and, in some cases, the studies are
still not complete. Part of the need for continuing
the investigation of some systems results from the
fact that much of the data was obtained with NaBF
preparations less pure than that now available, 2°
The influence of impurities in the NaBF , on lig-
uidus and solidus temperatures is, unfortunately,

most strongly evident in NaBF4-rich compositions
close to the presently favored coolant composition
(92 mole % NaBF4—8 mole % NaF). However, the
changes in the published diagrams are too minor to
warrant their revision.

Because of possible involvement of hydroxy fluo-
roborates in the corrosion behavior of fluoroborate
coolants, we have started work with these mate-
rials.

The System NaF-KBF ,. — M. A. Bredig pointed
out in the previous progress report?! that our data
on the system NaF-KBF | provided evidence of non-
ideality. His conclusion was based on one lig-
uidus temperature in the high-NaF portion of the
system that was considerably below the liquidus
curve that we had drawn for this diagram. We have
now determined liquidus temperatures for five addi~
tional compositions in the range 10 to 40 mole %
NaBF | and have confirmed the shape of the lig-
uidus curve predicted by Bredig for this portion of
the diagram.

The System NaBF .KBF ,. — Differential thermal
analysis data with compositions containing 80, 85,
and 90 mole % NaBF , (high-purity material) showed
liquidus and solidus temperatures about 3 to 5°C
higher than values obtained earlier with less pure
NaBF4. The minimum solidus temperature in this
solid solution system is now believed to be 396 *
2°, and the minimum melting composition contains
approximately 90 mole % NaBF .

Preparation and Thermal Properties of KBF ;OH.
— Since oxygen was an impurity in all NaBF‘4 prep

arations made by aqueous methods and these prep-
arations exhibited low melting points, we suspected
that hydrolysis products such as NaBF30H might
be responsible for the observed melting-point lower-
ing. The hydroxy fluoroborates, if present in cool-
ant mixtures, would be expected to be more corro-
sive than the pure fluoroborates. Although
NaBF OH is of greater interest than KBF ;,OH, we
prepared the latter first because it proved to be
easier to synthesize.

We chose the method of Wamser!? and Ryss?? as
described by Pawlenko?? to prepare a 1.6-mole
batch of KBFSOH. The reaction proceeds accord-
ing to the equation

The, product, being only slightly soluble in water
at 0°C, precipitated, and it was filtered and dried
by pumping overnight at room temperature. A yield
of 57% was obtained. The dried product contained
1.4% H O, 8.78% boron, and 46.0% fluorine (theo-
retical B = 8.80%, F = 46.4%). The calculated B/F
atomic ratio was 2.98.

Pawlenko reported??® a melting point of 332°C for
this compound, The DTA curves that we obtained
with our preparation were difficult to interpret, but
the liquidus temperature appeared to be 355°C, and
other thermal effects on heating were observed at
344 and 287°C. The corresponding effects on cool-
ing were at 333, 306, and 266°C respectively. The
undercooled liquidus break may have been inter-
preted by Pawlenko to be the liquidus temperature.
Pawlenko?? investigated phase relations in the
systems KBFSOH-KBF4 and KF-KBFSOH-KBF4.
We plan to proceed with the preparation of
NaBF ,OH and with the study of phase relations in
the system NaBF4-NaBF30H.

12,2.2 Crystal Structure of Sodium
Tetrafluoroborate

G. D. Brunton

Unlike any of the complex fluorides which crys-
tallize from the MSR fluids based on the compo-
nents LiF, BeF , Z:F,, UF,, and ThF ,, the alkali
fluoroborates undergo pronounced crystalline tran-
sitions. Sodium tetrafluoroborate crystallizes from
melts as a cubic phase which inverts on cooling to
temperatures below 240°C to an orthorhombic form
which is ~20% more dense than the higher-tempera-
ture cubic form. Such behavior indicates that the
crystal chemistry of the alkali fluoroborates may be
of significance in molten-salt reactor coolant tech-
nology and has prompted a reexamination of the
structure of NaBF4. Lattice parameters and atomic
parameters of the compound were remeasured. The
refined parameters were found to be only slightly
different from those determined by Weiss and
Zohner?# from two-dimensional Weissenberg data.
The orthorhombic form of NaBF | crystallizes in the
space group Cmcm; refined values for the unit cell

The entropy of transition of KBF, is almost
double that of NaBF ,. This is explained qualita-
tively on the basis of the differing structures of the
low-temperature solids, whereas the high-tempera-
ture solids both presumably have the cubic struc-
ture. The low-temperature NaBF | with the ortho-
thombic CaSO4 (pseudocubic) structure is much
closer to the high-temperature cubic form than is
the low-temperature KBF | with its orthorhombic
BaSO , (pseudotetragonal) structure.

12.2.4 Dissociation Pressure and Chemical
Thermodynamics of the System KBF ,-KF

Stanley Cantor J. A. Bornmann

The possibility that KBF , will be a component of
the coolant for an advanced molten-salt reactor
prompted us to examine the dissociation equilib-
rium

KBF (1) = KF(l) + BF (8 . (1)

Techniques derived from the study of the similar

25,26 greatly sim-

NaBF4 dissociation equilibrium
plified the present investigation.

In a closed apparatus of known volume, BF
pressures in equilibrium with the melt were meas-
ured manometrically in the composition range 15.7
to ~100 mole % KBF4. For each composition,
pressures were measured over at least a 140° tem-
perature interval within overall limits of 628 to
1207°C. Four isotherms of BF | pressure vs com-
position are depicted in Fig., 12.5.

The analysis of the experimental data to yield
thermodynamic information for KBF -KF is iden-
tical to the data analysis for the system NaBF -
NaF. Details of the thermodynamic treatment are
given elsewhere.?%:26

The equilibrium constant, K | for the dissocia-
tion [as written in Eq. (1)] is defined as

where 37,300 cal and 26.2 cal/°K are the enthalpy

stant, is 1.987 cal/°K. For the reaction

NaBF () = NaF(]) + BF (8) , (4)

the derived enthalpy and entropy were 29,800 cal
and 26.4 cal/°K. The relative magnitudes of the
thermodynamic quantities for the two reactions (1)
and (4) seem plausible. In both reactions, AS? is
mostly due to the expansion of a mole of BF, in
the melt to a mole of vapor; hence it is not surpris-
ing that the reaction entropies are virtually the
same. The larger values of AH for reaction (1) can
be explained in terms of the ‘‘fluoride-donor’’ prop-

erties of the two alkali ions. In forming the com-
plex ion BF4“, the potassium ion with its weaker
electric field strength ‘“‘donates’’ fluoride ions
more easily than does sodium; therefore [BF4]“
ions are more stable in the presence of potassium
ions. This margin of stability is approximately
equal to the difference in the enthalpies of the dis-
sociation reactions.

The activity coefficients of KBF, and KF were
derived at several temperatures from the vapor
pressure data. The curves of activity coefficient
vs composition at 1100°C are shown in Fig. 12.6.
Note that the activity coefficients are unity or
greater; that is, the deviations from ideality are
always positive. The activity coefficients in the
system NaBF -NaF were similarly positive. In
fact, it is usually true that binary melts which con-
sist of a common alkali cation and differing uni-
valent anions exhibit positive deviations.?27

The basic method was to determine the top sur-
face of a column of melt. The nickel vessel con-
taining the salt was a cylindrical cup at its lower
section and a conical top welded to a relatively
long chimney as its upper section (see Fig. 12.7).
The purpose of the conical top was to permit easy
escape of gas bubbles from the melt. The vessel
was loaded with enough salt so that the melt filled
the lower portion of the chimney. The probe, a
sharp-pointed nickel rod, entered the chimney
through a Teflon bushing tightened to the top of the
chimney. At each fixed temperature the probe was
caused to contact the liquid surface several times,
each point of contact ‘“seen’’ by the deflection of a
pointer of a vacuum-tube volt-ohmmeter. From ma-
chined lines on the probe (above the chimney) the
vertical displacement of the probe was determined
to 0.1 mm by means of a cathetometer. The volume

of the vessel had been calibrated with water at
room temperature at several liquid levels. Recali-
brations were performed after the measurements to
be sure that the vessel had restored itself to its
initial volume.

The viscosity of single-component NaBF , has
been measured at Mound Laboratory by L. J.
Wittenberg and co-workers using oscillating-cup
methods. 2?2 The measurements are still being ana-
lyzed; however, two reliable values appear to be
1.45 centipoises at 420°C and 1.04 centipoises at
500°C. Assuming that these two values define the
correct linear log n — T~ relationship, then the
viscosity of NaBF4 may be expressed as

7 (centipoise) = 0.0623 exp [2180/7 (°K)] .

The viscosities of NaBF , correlate reasonably
well with viscosities of other sodium salts con-
taining monovalent anions, as shown in Table 12.1.
The corresponding temperature, 0, is defined as the
measured temperature divided by the melting tem-
perature, both in °K. Viscosities and melting tem-
peratures for the salt other than NaBF , were ob-
tained from the compilations of Janz et al.2° For
NaBF, the melting temperature of 680°K was used.

12.2.6 Corrosion of Chromium by Molten
Fluoroborates

Stanley Cantor

In a series of tests3? which sought to determine
if the proposed MSRE substitute coolant, NaBF -
NaF (92-8 mole %), reacted with Hastelloy N or any
of its major constituents, it was found that chro-
mium was the only metal to exhibit a significant
degree of corrosion. In this test, shiny chromium
chips were immersed in the melt for 837 hr at 600°C

in a nickel vessel which was open only to a pres-
sure measuring device. In the course of the test
(at 600°C) the vapor pressure of BF | rose from an
initial 170 torrs to a final pressure of 280 torrs.
Postexposure examination revealed two reaction
products: (1) gray material, adhering strongly to
the surface of the chromium chips, and (2) green
crystalline Na, CrF . mixed with the unreacted fluo-
roborate salt.

The oxidation of chromium to the trivalent state,
in Na CrF , required that a chemical species in
contact with the chromium metal be reduced; the
most likely species was boron; that is, some of the
trivalent boron in NaBF , was reduced to elemental
boron or to a boride. Spectroscopic analysis of
some of the gray surface material showed 2 to 5
wt % boron. On the basis of the above evidence,
the corrosion of chromium may be described by the
following reactions:

[1 + x]Cr(metal) + NaBF (1) = NaF(I)
+ CtF (1) + Cr B(s) ,
3NaF(I) + CrF (1) = Na,CrF (s) ;

Cr B represents the gray material and is a com-
pound or mixture of undetermined stoichiometry.
(X-ray diffraction analysis failed to identify the
gray material in terms of known chromium-boron
compounds.) The second reaction not only de-
scribed the observed formation of Na CrF but also
indicated a decreased thermodynamic activity of
NaF in the melt which resulted in an increased
vapor pressure of BFS.

The chromium metal was also examined metallo-
graphically. The photomicrographs showed that the
corrosion was confined to a rather shallow depth,
approximately 10 mils. Further, the uncorroded
metal did not exhibit voids; that is, vacancies
which formed in the corrosion layers did not serve
as a sink for chromium atoms diffusing from the un-
reacted portions of the lattice. Thus the metallo-
graphic examination suggests that in chromium
metal the corrosion product (represented as Cpr)
acts as an impediment to further reaction by fluoro-
borate.

AND LiF-BeF - ThF , MIXTURES

12.3.1 CeF, Solubility in Molten Mixtures
of LiF, BeF,, and ThF,

L. O. Gilpatrick C. J. Barton
Judy A. Fredricksen

It has been demonstrated that the solubility of
CeF3 in some molten fluoride salt mixtures is very
similar to that of PuF _,3! Currently proposed
molten-salt systems for single-region reactors con-
tain several mole percent ThF4, a component not

previously examined in detail for its effect on PuF3

or CeF _ solubility. If a molten-salt reactor is to
be fueled using plutonium as the fissile agent, it
will be necessary to determine the limits of solu-
bility of PuF3 in the fluid medium under considera-
tion.3? The choice of cerium in place of plutonium
greatly speeded the present work and reduced the
hazards.

To examine this problem, cerous fluoride contain-
ing 144Ce (285-day) tracer was used to determine
the solubility of CeF _ in a variety of molten fluo-
ride salt mixtures. This material was prepared
from cerous chloride solution to which 10 mc of
144Ce was added as the chloride, Ammonium bi-
fluoride was added to precipitate CeF
washed, centrifuged, and dried.

An excess of the labeled CeF3 was added to
about 200 g of experimental salt, and the mixture
was then melted and purified to remove oxides by
passing through it HF, He, and H . The equili-
brated clean solution was sampled at temperature
using a copper frit filter stick technique. Re-
covered specimens were then analyzed both by
counting and by wet chemical analysis for their
cerium content. From this information the molar

3 which was

composition was calculated and plotted as the log
of concentration vs the reciprocal of the tempera-
ture. A comparison of the two methods of analysis
plotted in this manner is shown in Fig. 12.8. There
appears to be very good agreement between the re-
sults obtained by the two methods of analysis.

Six fuel compositions containing substantial
amounts of ThF4 were examined over a 200°C tem-

12.3.2 Solubility of Thorium Metal in Molten
Lithium Fluoride—Thorium Fluoride Mixtures

H. R. Bronstein M. A. Bredig

We have previously reported that we observed the
solubility of thorium metal in molten LiF—'l“hF‘4 (73-
27 mole %) at 620°C to be approximately 2.0 mole
%,33 with no visible sign of alloying of the nickel
of the container by the thorium through the medium
of the melt.34 This result was contrary to the find-
ings by Barton and Stone3® of extensive alloying.
A possible explanation of the discrepancy was the
absence of gas-stirring in our experiments. Re-
peating the experiment with continuous argon gas-
stirring, we have now corroborated the findings of
Barton and Stone. In the products of the extensive
attack by the dissolved thorium on the nickel con-
tainer, two nickel-rich phases of the five known
intermetallic nickel-thorium compounds have been
positively identified: namely, ThNi  as the major
and ThNi_ as a minor constituent, with some x-ray
reflections still remaining to be identified. The
great importance of the stirring reflects the low
solubility of the thorium metal in the salt melt. We
hope that with improvement in analytical technique
the solubility of thorium may be more accurately
determined. At present the value may be stated to
be between 0.3 and 1.0 mole % at 620°C.

The particular form in which thorium metal dis-
solved in the fluoride melt is yet to be determined.
A mechanism has been proposed3’ whereby alloy-
ing with the nickel of the container takes place by
disproportionation of a soluble subvalent thorium
species formed by reaction of thorium metal with
Th** ion in the melt. However, while thorium
species of lower valency have been reported for
chloride and iodide melts, the presence of sub-

valent species in fluoride media is as yet unsup-
ported, 36

In the present case a reaction involving color-
center-like electrons (from Th® + 4Li* > Th** 4
4Li°, and 4Li° » 4Li* + 4e™) according to

1

Th** + 4e~ + 2Ni —> ThNi,

seems possible. According to general experience
with metal solubility in the form of subvalent ions,
color-center-like electrons seem a preferred alter-
native in a medium in which the normal, higher va-
lence state IV of thorium is stabilized against re-
duction by complexing with the excess of fluoride
ions from LiF.

In connection with our present work, evidence for
trivalent thorium in an alleged solid ‘“ThOF”’ re-
ported recently®’ was carefully examined and found
to be without merit.3® The most serious objection
is based upon the x-ray data giving a lattice con-
stant of 5.68 A for a face-centered cubic fluorite
type of structure, only 0.10 A larger than 5.58 A
for ThO,. From a comparison of various lanthanide
and actinide oxyfluorides, MOF, with their diox-
ides, MO , it is certain that a true oxyfluoride of
Th(IIl), ThOF, if it existed, would have a lattice
constant of at least 5.90 A, or 0.30 A larger than
ThO . Actually, the lattice constant 5.68 A ob-
served by the French authors is most likely that of
the saturated solution of ThF  in ThO , approxi-
mately ThO1 SF, for which a; = 5.66 had been re-
ported.3? Therefore it must have been the reaction

2'I‘h02 + ThF, (+Th) —> 2ThO, SF
+ ThOF2 (+Th unreacted) ,

involving only Th(IV) that was observed by the
French authors.

Incidentally, a reaction of nickel through the
medium of a salt melt with a metal other than tho-
rium, namely, beryllium, has recently been reported
by Russian workers. 40

12.3.3 Heat Content of LiF-Ber-ThF4
(72-16-12 mole %)

A. S. Dworkin

The following equations represent our measured
heat content data for LiF-Ber—ThF4 (72-16-12
mole %) in cal/g:

Solid
H,-H, =-5284+207x10""t
+6.33 x 10~ 5¢2 (25—445°C) + 0.5% ;
Liquid
H, - H, =11.34 + 3.237

x 10—1¢ (500-750°C) + 0.1% .

The specific heat of the liquid is then the deriva-
tive of the last equation, or 0.324 cal g=! (°C)~1,
with an estimated error of +2%. There is no iso-
thermal heat of fusion for the mixture. According
to the phase diagram, initial melting begins at
about 445°C, and continues as temperature is in-
creased to 500°C, at which point it is ¢ mpletely
liquid. No experimental points were ovtained in
the temperature interval 445 to 500°C. However, if
the heat content of the solid is extrapolated to
500°C, a heat of fusion of 59 cal/g can be calcu-
lated by treating the data as if all the melting oc-
curred at this liquidus temperature.

The specific heats and heats of fusion (as de-
fined above) of various fuel salt mixtures have
been estimated.*! The validity of our methods of
estimation has been confirmed by comparison with
our measurements as well as those for a number of
other mixtures containing fluorides of lithium, be-
ryllium, and thorium.

ances independent of measuring frequency and

cussed previously.*®

For measurements of conductance in molten fluo-
rides, the entire assembly shown in Fig. 12.9 was
immersed in a stirred molten KNO _ bath. A spe-
cially constructed measuring bridge*® containing a
series-component balancing arm determined resist-
ance as a function of frequency. With this experi-
mental arrangement, the measured resistance was
stable, independent of depth of cell immersion, and
varied less than 0.5% over the frequency range 1 to
10 kilohertz, the variation being approximately
linear in f1/2. Values of measured resistance ex-
trapolated to infinite frequency were less than 0.3%
lower than the 10-kilohertz values.

The molten fluoride was contained in a closed
silica cell (pressure = 1 atm) in which the low equi-
librium partial pressure of SiF, (<1 mm at 500°C)*’
prevented major attack of the silica via the reac-
tion

2BeF  + Si0,—> 2BeO + SiF .
The slow, solid-solid reaction

and the low solubility of BeO and Be2SiO4 (<0.01

ductance measurements.

The variation of activation energy for conduct-
ance at low temperatures has been interpreted by
Angell39.51 in terms of a model based on a theo-
retical glass transition temperature, which incor-
porates a non-Arrhenius form for the temperature
dependence of transport properties. While there is
as yet no completely satisfactory theoretical justi-
fication for the proposed equations, they have led
to striking correlations in a number of systems.
Since the eutectic composition of 52 mole % BeF2
presents the largest temperature range, we have
estimated the glass transition temperature for this
composition. The temperature dependence of the
corrected energy of activation is, according to the
model,

termined is 1400 + 150°K. The reduced tempera-
ture range of the measurements based on this value
of T is 2.1 S T/T, £ 2.5, which is slightly above
the range of reduced temperatures for which Angell*?
found k to be constant in the molten Ca(NO 3)2-
KNO3 system (T S 1.7T0). Angell estimated an
increase in k over the low-temperature value (ob-
tained below 1.7T0) of about 10% at 2T0 and about
40% at 3T0. If a similar variation occurs in the
fused fluoride system, a k of 1400 would be ap-
proximately 20% too large, indicating its correct
value to be approximately 1170.

Since the assumptions of the model become more
nearly valid at temperatures near T , one might ex-
pect the data in the lower half of the temperature
range to provide a better estimate of T . It can be
seen from Fig. 12.12 that the results of the three
lowest temperatures [the three largest values of
(T/T - T0)2] indicate a T, of 350 + 25°K and a
corresponding value of k = 1200 £ 150°K. (The
range of values of T/T, would then be 1.9 to 2.1.)
These estimates appear to be consistent with re-

G. D. Robbins

In conjunction with a report*! on physical prop-
erties of molten salts of interest to the Molten-Salt
Reactor Program, the electrical conductivities of
six fused fluorides have been estimated as func-
tions of temperature. The results are listed in
Table 12.4.

Data on analogous or related molten-salt systems
provided a basis for the estimates. Often the as-
sumptions were not those which seemed chemically
most reasonable, but those which resulted in the
best correlation of the available data for the analog
systems. Therefore, estimated values of specific
conductance, «, are believed to have relatively .

figures in the equations of « vs t are not meant to
contradict the listed uncertainties, but rather are
intended to show differences between salt mix-

similar.

where (1/a) is the cell constant. As has been
pointed out previously,®# for a given apparatus and
set of experimental conditions the measured value
of resistance can vary with the frequency of the
applied potential wave form. The values of «
listed in the table are valid for resistance extrapo-
lated to infinite frequency (denoted as R_). Thus,
predicting the resistance of a melt which will be
measured in a particular experimental arrangement
not only requires a value for conductivity «, but
also presupposes a knowledge of the frequency dis-
persion characteristics of the measuring device.

12.4.3 Reference Electrodes for Molten Fluorides

B. F. Hitch C. F. Baes, Jr

As reported previously, 3556 the Be2 *|Be and the
HF,H _|F~ electrodes are stable reference elec-
trodes for use in LiF-BeF | mixtures. However,
both electrodes have disadvantages. Because of
the strong reducing power of the Be? ¥|Be electrode,
it is easily poisoned by impurities or solutes which
are reduced and deposited as metals on the elec-

trode surface. Hence it is necessary to maintain
the melt in the vicinity of this electrode quite free
of such reducible substances. This electrode can
also develop dendritic crystals of beryllium metal
on its surface as a result of mass transfer, and
these can short the electrode to the cell wall if
adequate clearance has not been provided. The
HF,HZ]F— electrode is somewhat inconvenient to
use, because it requires an HF-H, gas mixture of
known composition. A more serious disadvantage
of this electrode is that hydrogen is a reactive,
rapidly diffusing gas which is hard to confine to
the vicinity of the electrode.

In continuing our efforts to develop reference
electrodes for use in molten fluorides, we are in-
vestigating the cell

Be®|LiF-BeF (66-34)|NiO(c),BeO(c)|Ni? .

If the melt in contact with the nickel electrode is
saturated with both NiO and BeO, then the dis-
solved oxide concentration is fixed by the solu-
bility equilibrium of BeO,

BeO(c) = Bel'+ 02~
(e.g., [02~] T 0.01 mole/kg at 600°C),37 and

hence the nickel ion concentration is fixed by the
solubility equilibrium of NiO,

NiO(c) = Ni?*t + 02—

((Ni2*] ~ 0.001 mole/kg at 600°C).%8 This should
establish an Ni2 ¥|Ni electrode which depends only
on the temperature and the composition of the LiF-
BeF salt mixtures used. The low concentration of

Ni2* produced by this oxide mixture renders this
electrode — an electrode of the third kind — con-
siderably less oxidizing than a saturated NiF |Ni
electrode. This makes it possible to use copper
compartments for the electrode.

The assumed cell reaction is

Be? + NiO(c) = BeO(c) + Ni®.

Since all the reactants and products are of fixed
activity, the measured cell potential should be the
standard potential E?, which is a function only of
temperature. X-ray analysis has confirmed that
NiO, BeO, and LiF—BeF2 (66-34) are indeed the
only constituents in the Ni2 ¥|Ni electrode compart-
ment.

The reaction vessel used for our experiments was
constructed of 21/2-111. nickel pipe separated into
two compartments by a 1/1 o-in. nickel sheet welded
down through the center. Melt contact between the
two compartments was provided by a l/2-in.-dialm
sintered nickel (0.0015-in. porosity) frit. Each
compartment of the reaction vessel was fitted with
an entry port for an electrode, a gas sparging line,
and a thermocouple well. The Ni2*|Ni electrode
was further compartmented to contain the oxides
and the dissolved NiF,. The beryllium electrode
was used without any compartmentation.

Our early potentiometric measurements of the
above cell were made using an Ni2*|Ni compart-
ment constructed of copper tubing with a copper
frit (25- to 40-p porosity) welded on the lower end.
Excess BeO and NiO were added to the nickel
electrode compartment. The LiF-BeF2 solution
was then forced by a small gas pressure into the
compartment through the copper frit. A nickel tube
served as the nickel electrode and also permitted
gas sparging.

Cell potentials were erratic, but on various oc-
casions we were able to achieve stable potentials
for as long as 24 hr. The major difficulty encoun-
tered was that the cell potential would reach a
maximum value, then would begin drifting toward a
low value. Two possible causes of this behavior

58C. F. Baes, Jr., Thermodynamics, vol. 1, p. 409,
IAEA, Vienna, 1966.

are: (1) the nickel electrode was polarized by in-
termittent shorting to the copper compartment caus-
ing reduction of Ni2* on the copper to form a Cu-Ni
alloy, or (2) Ni2* diffused through the copper frit
at too rapid a rate. To check the first possibility,
a compartment was constructed of nickel tubing
sheathed in copper containing both nickel and
copper frits. Cell potentials obtained using this
compartment were somewhat more consistent, but
potential drifts toward a low value were still en-
countered. To deal with the second possible diffi-
culty we have recently had a much denser (6- to
14-y porosity) copper frit material fabricated by the
Gaseous Diffusion Development Division at K-25
and are having compartments fabricated using this
material. It is hoped that these less-porous frits
will reduce or eliminate any appreciable diffusion
of nickel ion out of the compartment. Measure-
ments will begin shortly, using these new compart-
ments.

Results obtained thus far indicate that the value
for the standard cell potential (E?) as a function of
temperature (°C) is

»a

E® = 1.903 — 0.0001¢ v .

The uncertainty is estimated to be approximately
+15 mv. The above value for E? compares well
with an E° calculated from the formation free en-
ergies for BeO %% and NiO.>?

The Ni2*|Ni electrode described above shows
promise for use as a reference electrode in molten
fluorides. If, indeed, we are able to establish its
reliability, we plan to use it as the reference elec-
trode to measure the redox potential of the U*¥|U3*
couple and, hopefully, to develop an Ni2 ¥|Ni elec-
trode assembly which could be used as an analyt-
ical tool for reactor application.

of ions in molten fluoride solvents. There is, how-
ever, a need for a container or cell with fixed trans-
parent windows. Such a container would provide a
fixed and easily determined path length, the fa-
cility to bubble the melt with reactive gases, and
better containment of volatile species. The prob-
lems encountered with such a cell have been to
find windows which were optically transparent in
the spectral range 200 to 2500 my and which would
resist the extremely corrosive action of molten flu-
orides. Also, it must be convenient to use, so that
the long-term applications of it to fluoride problems
would be practical.

Diamond best satisfies the window material re-
quirements. The cell which fits the design require-
ments is shown in Fig. 12.13. Except for the dia-
mond windows, the cell is made entirely of graphite.
It consists of a cell body, two retainers for the dia-

monds, a sleeve which holds the retainers in place,
and a nut to secure the sleeve. The optical path
length between the diamonds is 1.0 cm. The dia-
mond windows are approximately 5 x 5 x 1 mm type
Ila plates. Some variation in the diamond size from
the above nominal value is unavoidable. Conse-
quently, the cell design allows appreciable varia-
tions in the window dimensions. For example, one
of the plates we are now using measures 5.0 x 4.3 x
1.3 mm.

Positioning of a window in the cell is achieved
by means of a horizontal groove on the body which
fixes the vertical position, and a vertical groove on
the retainer which fixes the horizontal position.
The depth of each groove is one-half the window
thickness (nominally 1 mm), while the width of each
groove is, of course, the same as the width of the
window, 5 mm. With this arrangement, the windows
are not sealed gastight to the cell body but merely
fit flush to the body with a force of a few grams
exerted upon them. Fluid leakage around the win~
dows does not occur, because most molten fluoride
salts do not wet graphite. The advantages of this
arrangement are simplicity of design, ease of as-
sembly and disassembly, and no significant danger
of window breakage due to loading stresses.

This cell was successfully used in a number of
tests. A spectrophotometric base line for LiF-
BeF, (66-34 mole %) and the spectra of NiF , and
UF4 in the LiF-BeF , solvent were recorded. Be-
cause of the reproducibility of the base line
achieved with the diamond cell, a broad peak cen-
tered at 2.06 p in the UF solution spectrum was
identified for the first time in a molten fluoride
system (cf. Fig. 12.14). This peak has been seen
in noncorrosive systems before but has not been

strate both the valence state and coordination of
the molybdenum species. Peaks at 472 and 353 mu

The positions of these two transitions are consis-
tent with what is predicted from the spectrochem-

that MoF _ in L B is present as Mo’ * jons which

denum was invariably lost from solution after 24 hr
at 700°C due to an unexplained mechanism. Ex-
perience with the system has led us to believe that
impurity reactions were involved.

12.5.3 K MoF , Synthesis and Spectrum

As an independent demonstration that the melt
spectrum of MoF , in L B was due to octahedrally

coordinated Mo3*, that is, M0F63_, a spectrum of
Mo3®* in a known chemical environment was re-
quired. It was predicted®® that K MoF , would
probably exhibit a cubic structure in which the
Mo3* jon was coordinated to six fluoride ligands.
However, a previously reported synthesis of
K3M0F6 (ref. 64) was actually found to produce an
oxyfluoride compound that does not possess the re-
quired octahedral environment for Mo®*. Therefore,

K Mok = was prepared by mixing stoichiometric
quantities of KF and MoF _ (ref. 65) and fusing in a
sealed platinum tube at 880°C for half an hour. A
low (about 5%) yield of the product was obtained in
the form of small crystals which measured approxi-
mately 0.3 mm in diameter. These crystals were
hand picked and washed with ethanol and/or ace-
tone.

Density measurements of the K MoF , gave a
value of 3.23 + 0.03 g/cc at 25°C, which is con-
sistent with the assumed stoichiometry and meas-
ured unit cell dimensions. The crystal structure,
being completed at this writing by G. D. Brunton,
confirms that the compound is K MoF .

The diffuse reflectance spectrum of the crystals
reveals peaks at 264, 344, and 430 mu. The latter
two peaks are assigned to the same two transitions
as the bands at 350 and 470 my in the L2B solu-
tions of MoF3 (mentioned in the previous section).
The 264-my peak in the crystal spectrum is as-
signed to the highest-energy spin-allowed transi-
tion of a 4d ® ion in octahedral symmetry. In the
L2B—M0F3 melt spectrum this band is hidden by the
foot of an intense charge-transfer band.

With the crystal structure determination that the
Mo3* ion in KsMOFs is surrounded in octahedral
symmetry by six fluoride ligands as M0F63_, a
comparison between its spectrum and that of the
high-temperature MoF _ in L B gives concluding
evidence that the species present in the MOFB-L2B
solution is MoF 3~.

12.5.4 Studies of the Vapor Phase over MoF3

Solutions

Previously it was proposed that MoF | disappears
from LzB solutions by a disproportionation reac-
tion: ©©
2M0F3 — Mo + MoF .

We sought to support this argument by measuring
the spectrum of MoF  in the gas phase over a solu-
tion of MoF3 in L ,B; MoF has a strong charge-
transfer absorption in the 200-my region (€ = 103
liters mole~! cm™1!), with a vibrational structure
that provides a ‘‘fingerprint’’ for identification.

Initial attempts to measure MoF  directly over
the melt in a windowless container at 550 to 700°C
revealed no vapor species contributing a charge-
transfer spectrum. Because we knew neither our
sensitivity limits nor the reason for losses of mo-
lybdenum from the MoFs-LzB solutions, we refined
our approach in the following manner.

The second-order rate constant data of Weaver,
Hess, and Friedman®7 indicates that 1000 ppm of
MoF3 inL B would have an equilibrium pressure of
at least 1 torr. A calibration of our system with
MoF  gas showed that we could detect MoF _ at
pressures as low as 0,020 torr, Since the expected
equilibrium pressure of M0F6 over the MoF .-L. . B
solutions is 100 times greater than our sensitivity
limits, the technique described here was an excel-
lent way to demonstrate the validity of the dispro-
portionation assumption.

The procedure was simply to maintain an LQB
solution of MoF _ at 700°C or greater in an ap-
pendix tube attached to the 10-cm-path-length gas
cell fitted with quartz windows. The gas cell was
kept at room temperature and fitted into the sample
compartment of a Cary model 14 spectrometer. Any
MOF6 generated in the hot appendix tube was then
expected to diffuse into the gas cell, where its
spectrum could be measured.

First, MoF was introduced to demonstrate that
pressures as low as 0.020 to 0.050 torr were stable
in the system for 1 hr or more. Then solutions con-
taining 0.1 to 1.0 wt % M0F3 in L _B were fused in
the appendix tube and held at 700°C. Afterward,
visual observation indicated that these solutions
were stable. Under no conditions was MoF . evolu-
tion from solution observed — not even when the
solution temperature was raised to 900°C,

It has been concluded from this work that MoF ,
within detection limits, does not exist in equilib-
rium over solutions of MoF _ in L B, and thus we
have no basis to say that the above disproportiona-
tion occurs.

when such is equilibrated with L1213eF‘4 containing
up to 7 mole % ThF .. This two-phase distribution,
which may be viewed as a solvent extraction sys-
tem in which one of the phases is a solid solution,
is being studied further because of its obvious rel-
evance to the oxide chemistry of a single-fluid
MSBR fuel and because of its potential value as a
fuel reprocessing method.

In the present measurements a stirred, gastight
vessel®? is being used. The cover gas is argon,
which is recirculated at 10 psig in a closed system
by means of a finger pump. This gas system in-
cludes a drying tube and an infrared absorption cell
which can be used to detect the CO_ produced by
any inleakage and reaction of air with traces of
graphite present in the salt. A titration procedure
is being used in which UO2 or ThO, is added in
increments to LiF-BeF -ThF , (72-16-12 mole %) in
order to vary the composition of the oxide phase.
The fluoride phase is sampled frequently to deter-
mine the course of the U**-Th** distribution.

In the first run carried out by this procedure, the
following oxide compositions were employed:

Oxide Calculated Moles MF , Stirring Time
Added X U(0) Moles MO, (h)
UO2 0.92 2.274 187
U02 0.97 1.083 172
Th02 0.66 0.674 360
ThO2 0.44 0.425 361

In each of the fitrst two steps of the run, the amount
of U*" in the salt phase rose rapidly, then fell, and
finally increased once again. At the end of the
stirring period in each case, the concentration of
U4* in the salt phase was changing quite slowly
and probably was close to the equilibrium value.
For the first addition of UO2 the results were:

The values of Q [as defined above for reaction (1)]
were calculated from the analytical value of the U4*
concentration in the salt phase, XU(f),"0 and also
the values of XU(O), XTh(o)’ and XTh(f)’ which can
be deduced quite accurately by material balance.
The value of Q finally reached here is consistent
with the previously reported estimate.

When ThO2 was added in the third and fourth

steps, the U** concentration in the salt phase was
found to decrease, rise, and then decrease again;
but equilibrium probably was not obtained in these
steps because of the large amount of oxide to be
equilibrated and the small concentration of ura-
nium?’? in the fluoride phase. The interesting ki-
netic behavior observed following both UO2 and
ThO2 additions probably reflects the combined ef-
fects of nonuniform oxide composition’! and chang-
ing particle size before equilibrium is reached. In
future measurements, an effort will be made to
hasten the approach to equilibrium by the use of
more vigorous stirring as well as lower oxide-to-
fluoride phase ratios.

was determined. In continuing these studies, we
have measured the lower equilibrium partial pres-
sures of SiF, produced when the ratio of BeO/SiO,
in the solids is increased. With the BeO/SiO2
ratio near 2 (the composition of phenacite), the -
system was very slow to reach equilibrium. With
this ratio in the range 3 to 6, presumably producing
BeO + BeZSiO4 as the equilibrium solids, equilib-
rium partial pressures in the recirculating gas sys-
tem were reached in 40 to 100 hr, depending on the
temperature.

These lower SiF | partial pressures are compared
with those measured previously in Fig. 12.15. The

of formation of Be SiO, from BeO and SiO :

= —4.7 kcal/mole . (3)

Combining the heats of reaction (1) and (3),
AH(2) = AH(1) — 2AH(3) .

The slope of the lower dashed line in Fig. 12.15 is
given by AH(2), while the intercept of the line is
fixed by the requirement that it intersect with the
(upper) line, corresponding to reaction (1), at the
temperature at which phenacite decomposes by the
reverse of reaction (3). Morgan and Hummel re-

port’S this decomposition temperature to be 1560°C.

The data actually obtained above 700°C are seen
to agree quite well with the predicted behavior.
Below this temperature, however, the measured
pressures are increasingly higher than the pre-
dicted values. One explanation for this effect
would be the appearance of a new solid phase be-
low 700°C, one in which the BeO/SiO2 ratio is
greater than 2 and which perhaps contains fluoride.
Silicates of Ca, Ba, and Sr are known in which the
MO/SiO2 ratio is 3, but such are not known for Mg
or Be. Furthermore, we have been unable to pro-
duce readily detectable amounts of such a new
compound in mixtures of SiOz, Be28i04, and BeO
equilibrated with LizBeF4 at 625 to 650°C for as
much as 30 days.

Another possible explanation is the existence of
a previously unsuspected solid-state transition in
BeO occurring at or below 700°C with a transition
heat of ~4 kcal/mole. To our knowledge, however,
no other evidence of such a transition exists. In
fact, in our measurements the same powder pattern
has been found for BeO samples equilibrated above
and below 700°C, and it agrees with that reported
in the literature. Hence the possibility of a transi-
tion in BeO seems unlikely.

Whatever the explanation of this somewhat high

value of P . below 700°C in the latest measure-

ments, the chemistry of silica in LiF-BeF  melts
is now fairly well defined. In future measurements
we plan to study the ion exchange properties of

Be SiO,, which has an open structure.’® Further,
we wish to explore rare-earth-containing silicates
which might be produced by equilibration of
BeZSiO4 with LiF-BeF2 melts containing rare-earth
trifluorides.

13.1 REDUCTIVE EXTRACTION OF 233Pa
AND URANIUM FROM MOLTEN LiF-BeF -ThF,
MIXTURES INTO BISMUTH

D. M. Moulton W. R. Grimes
J. H. Shaffer

It was shown earlier! that protactinium could be
extracted successfully from the two-region molten-
salt breeder reactor blanket salt and that in trans-
port between two salts through a metal the material
balance could be maintained. The extraction of
protactinium at tracer level from the single-region
breeder salt mixture into bismuth has now been
demonstrated as well.

In the first experiment, 3.91 kg of LiF-BeF -
ThF, (72-16-12 mole %) with 1 mc of 233Pa was
added to an all-graphite vessel containing 3.00 kg
of high-purity (99.995+%) bismuth. Three 3-g por-
tions of thorium metal reductant were added. At the
end of this time 70.4% of the protactinium was in
the metal and 23.4% was in the salt, for an overall
protactinium balance of 93.8%. The molar distribu-
tion ratio was 13.0. At this point the furnace con-
troller failed, and the temperature went to 1100+
When all was restored to normal, the salt was hy-
drofluorinated to reoxidize the protactinium. Only
about 67% of it could be gotten into the salt. The
experiment was continued at 700°, but the balance
was only 65 to 83% of the original and began to fall
when Dpa reached 2. It was again hydrofluori-
nated, and 58% of the protactinium was recovered.
In the thought that some iron from the vessel top
had reached the liquids by refluxing vapors during
the temperature excursion, 189 g of tin was added
to raise iron solubility., The balance improved to
about 90%, but dropped again when only a few per-
cent of the protactinium had been extracted. It
seemed that this experiment, which had started so
promisingly, had been ruined by the temperature

runaway, and it was ended. A few metal-phase
analyses of the all-bismuth run at 700° showed

Dy /D, = 278 with equal valences over a fourfold
concentration change.

The experiment was repeated with 3.15 kg of the
same salt containing 0.3 mole % UF .. Again, 3 kg
of bismuth was used in an all-graphite apparatus.
Thorium metal was added as a reductant, and
samples were taken at 600 and 700° after each ad-
dition. The uranium balance remained good through-
out the experiment. The protactinium balance was
very good until about 40% of it had been extracted
(D,, ™ 2); then it began to decline rather sharply.
It was thought that thorium solubility had been
reached, and the experiment was terminated; but it
turned out that this was not the case, at least if
thorium solubility in a mixed system with uranium
is the same as in bismuth alone. The maximum
amount of protactinium extracted at 600° was 74%,
with an overall protactinium balance of 86%.

In this experiment, contrary to what had been
found earlier, the valence 3 fitted uranium better
than 4. It also fitted protactinium somewhat better,
but 4 was used in the calculations. The apparent
thorium valence, compared with the lithium valence
of 1, was about 1.5 throughout the experiment from
DTh =0.00018 to 0.017. There were some rather
larger discrepancies in some of the lithium and
thorium analyses performed by two different
methods on the same samples, and this may account
for some of this strange behavior. It may not be en-
tirely unreal, however, since several rare-earth ex-
traction experiments show an apparently low tho-
rium valence at high thorium mole fraction in bis-
muth. At any rate the valence of 4 was used in the
calculations and is reflected in the rather large
standard deviations. In comparison with the results
reported earlier for the two-region blanket salt, the
thorium-protactinium separation is harder but is
still quite feasible, while the protactinium-uranium
separation is easier. Because of the thorium va-
lence anomaly, its values should be used cau-
tiously.

Inasmuch as the composition of the single-region
breeder fuel salt has not been definitely estab-
lished, a protactinium extraction was carried out
in a salt with a lower ‘‘free fluoride’’ concentra-
tion, LiF-BeF ,‘,-ThF4 (68-20-12 mole %). About
4.14 kg of this salt containing 41 g of UF , was ex-
tracted in an all-graphite vessel with 3.00 kg of
high-purity bismuth using thorium metal as a reduc-
tant at 600 and 700°, At several points in the ex-
periment, the phases were sampled at about 2, 4,
and 20 hr after the metal addition to see whether
there was any loss of reduced metals with time.
The only change of significance was at the highest
thorium concentration, when the protactinium distri-
bution tripled over this period of time, most of the
rise coming between the first two samplings. This
is perhaps due to slow dissolution of thorium bis-
muthide in the high-thorium solution. No signifi-
cant losses of reduced metals were detected at any
time,

The protactinium balance remained good up to
about 10% extraction (DPa ~ 0.5). Then it fell
slowly until the experiment was ended, again at a
point below thorium saturation. The maximum ex-
tracted was 41% at a balance of 58%. Distributions
are calculated on the amount found.

Lithium and thorium analyses were carried out in
the usual way. Uranium analyses for the salt phase
only were completed at this writing, but the distri-

butions were calculated on the basis of 100% mass
balance.

The uranium analyses, though preliminary, indi-
cate an adequate uranium-protactinium separation.
In this experiment, unlike the previous one, a tho-
rium valence of 4 fits the data quite well for the
entire range of D, =0.0007 to 0.012. In this salt
the thorium activity is higher than in the 72-16-12
mole % mixture. However, the protactinium activity
is higher still; so the thorium-protactinium separa-
tion looks better, in fact nearly as good as in the
blanket salt.

These tracer-level experiments indicate that prot-
actinium can be extracted from single-region salts
of various compositions. The protactinium activity
is rather strongly influenced by the salt composi-
tion, and further work will be needed to define the
nature of this dependence. The problem of protac-
tinium balance is still with us, but protactinium
disappearance seems to vary from experiment to ex-
periment; in the first of the above, the balance was
quite good until the accident; in the second, it per-
sisted to a very high distribution ratio. Since there
is no consistent pattern to the disappearance, we
suspect that the tiny amount of material is attach-
ing itself to some speck of contaminant and that
this will not be a problem when reasonable amounts
of protactinium are used.

13.2 REDUCTIVE EXTRACTION OF RARE
EARTHS FROM MOLTEN MIXTURES OF LiF,
BeF,, AND ThF, INTO BISMUTH AND
BISMUTH ALLOY MIXTURES

J. H. Shaffer D. M. Moulton
W. R. Grimes

The adaptation of reductive extraction as a
method for removing rare earths from the fuel sol-
vent mixture into a molten metal phase will depend,
in part, on the magnitude of the distribution coef-
ficients for the rare earths between the two liquid
phases and the relative separation of these fission
products from major constituents of the salt mix-
ture. Where bismuth is the molten metal phase, the
distribution of rare earths between the two liquid
phases at equilibrium can be expressed by the re-
actions

- — O -
(RE)F, (garty + nL1€Bi) = (RE)/; + nLiF (1)
and
4(RE)Fn(sa1t) + nTh?Bi) =

4(RE)(0}31) +nThF (salt) ’ (2)
where n denotes the valence of a particular rare
earth (RE). Since beryllium does not form inter-
metallic compounds with bismuth and is essentially
insoluble in bismuth at temperatures of interest to
this program, its presence in the salt mixture does
not have a direct effect on the reductive extraction
process. Separation factors obtained from Eq. (1)
are very favorable for the reductive extraction
process. However, separations obtained from Eq.
(2) are less favorable and may only be marginally
feasible for removing certain of the rare-earth fis-
sion product species.? In addition, the degree to
which rare earths can be extracted per equilibrium
stage depends on the concentrations of reduced
species in solution in the bismuth, a measure of the
reduction potential of the system. Since thorium
metal forms an intermetallic compound with bis-
muth, the reduction potential of the system is
limited to relatively low values which correspond to
its solubility in the bismuth pool.

The equilibrium reduction of rare earths by tho-

Since separation factors and distribution coeffi-
cients for the reductive extraction process are
based on chemical concentrations N rather than
thermodynamic activities, they may be altered by
imposing changes in the activity coefficients y of
the chemical species in the two liquid phases. Ac-
cordingly, this experimental program is currently
directed toward a chemical evaluation of the reduc-
tive extraction process with respect to salt solvent
composition and metal phase composition for the
various important rare-earth fission products.

13.2.1 Effect of Salt Composition

The selection of the fuel solvent for the single-
region molten-salt breeder reactor will consider not
only the nuclear and physical characteristics of the
salt mixture but also its chemical properties with
respect to the reactor environment and the chemical
reprocessing plant. The ternary system LiF-BeF .
ThF has been chosen for this application with
probable thorium concentrations of 10 to 12 mole %,
beryllium concentrations of 16 to 20 mole %, and
the balance lithium fluoride. Within these re-
straints, however, activity coefficients for the in-
dividual salt constituents may be quite varied. The
results of this investigation demonstrate these vari-
ations by their effects on the reductive extraction
of cerium from several salt mixtures into bismuth.

When beryllium fluoride and thorium fluoride are
mixed with alkali fluorides as a molten solution,
they form coordinated compounds which can be ex-
plained by a fluoride bridging concept.® This co-
ordination may be visualized as the chemical equi-
libria

2LiF + BeF, = Li BeF, 4

and

3LiF + ThF4 — Li ThF . (5)

In the highly ionized fluoride melt, ‘‘basic’’ ions of
BeF 2- and ThF_3~ would be formed; any unasso-
ciated ions furnished by LiF would be considered
“‘acidic.”” Although quantitative estimates of these
coordination reactions are not available, their pres-
ence should affect the activity coefficients of the
salt-phase constituents, which should, in turn, alter
the equilibria of the reductive extraction process.
For purposes of this study the reductive extraction
data were empirically correlated to the excess or
deficit in the ‘‘free fluoride’ content of a specific
salt mixture.? This reference scale,

excess free fluoride

= mole % LiF-2(mole % Ber)-3(mole % ThF4) , (6)

was defined by the assumption that BeF  and ThF
would be completely coordinated according to Egs.
(4) and (5). This study has examined eight different
salt compositions having a ‘‘free fluoride’’ range of
—17 to + 28 units. Although not an important fis-
sion product, the extraction study used cerium as a
reference for analytical convenience. Individual
experiments with other rare earths of interest
should suffice for describing the effects of salt
composition on the overall rare-earth extraction
process.

The experimental procedure was directed pri-
marily toward the evaluation of pertinent equi-
librium data according to Eq. (3). If the activity
coefficients remain constant during each individual
extraction experiment, then the concentrations of
reaction constituents may be equated to a constant
by the relation

where K _ is the equilibrium quotient and N and D
are the mole fraction and distribution coefficient,
respectively, for the designated species. Changes
in values for K _ with salt composition should re-
flect changes in the activity coefficients of the
salt-phase constituents. Values for the equilibrium
quotients were derived from radiochemical analyses

“M. A. Bredig, letter to W. R. Grimes, Apr. 26, 1968.

of samples taken from the salt and metal phases for
cerium and from spectrochemical analyses of the
metal-phase samples for lithium and thorium.
Changes in the reduction potential were made by
adding lithium metal (thorium metal in two experi-
ments) directly to the molten metal phase in small
tared increments until apparent saturation of the
bismuth phase by thorium was achieved. Although
emphasis was placed on measurements at 600°C,
experimental data were obtained over the range 500
to 800°C for some of the extraction systems.

Typical data obtained during one extraction ex-
periment are illustrated in Fig. 13.1 and demon-
strate reasonable agreement with Eq. (7). Equi-
librium quotients for similar extractions from the
various salt mixtures studied are shown in Table
13.1. The relation of these equilibrium quotients at
600°C to the ““free fluoride’’ model is illustrated in
Fig. 13.2. Although empirical, these results pro-
vide a reasonable basis for predicting rare-earth ex-
traction behavior over the salt composition region
of interest in the MSBR program.

Since the experimental data were not necessarily
obtained up to the solubility limit of thorium in bis-
muth, the values calculated for the equilibrium quo-
tients are useful in establishing limiting parameters
of the extraction process. The solubility of thorium
in bismuth has been reported by several investi-
gators.>~7 The data of Bryner and Brodsky, ex-

limiting distribution coefficients and separation
factors are presented in Table 13.2. The effect of
“free fluoride’’ on the separation of cerium from
thorium at 600°C is illustrated in Fig. 13.3.

13.2.2 Effect of Metal-Phase Composition

The composition of the fuel salt mixture will be
strongly influenced by considerations other than
that of optimum reprocessing. On the other hand,
the metal-phase composition is subject to no re-
strictions except that it be noble and containable.
There are two possible ways to improve the separa-
tion. If the rare-earth activity could be lowered and
the thorium activity left unchanged, then a higher
fraction of rare earth would be removed before tho-
rium bismuthide precipitation. Both the amount re-
moved and the separation would be improved. If on
the other hand the thorium solubility could be in-
creased without changing the activities, then the
amount of rare earth removed would also be in-
creased. Thorium solubility can be increased
somewhat by raising the temperature of the bis-
muth, but rare-earth removal is only about doubled
in 100°; a change of metal phase might help much
more. Both of these possibilities are being investi-

gated at this time. So far, no good way of substan-
tially raising thorium solubility has been found;
bismuth is actually one of the best low-temperature
solvents.

There seems to be no good theoretical basis for
choosing a metal solvent in which rare-earth activi-
ties will be lowered still further with respect to
thorium. It is quite obvious that the strong inter-
metallic compound formation by bismuth and rare
earths is the only thing which lets the separation
even be close, since reduction to the pure metals
would take thorium out much earlier. Some very
limited experience with extracting rare earths from
LiF-BeF2 (66-34 mole %) into lead implies that a
rare-earth—thorium separation would be worse in
this system than in bismuth. Lead is less electro-
negative than bismuth and forms weaker interme-
tallics. This finding suggests that more electro-
negative metals should be tried as solvents or as
major additives to the bismuth.

One metal that should form stronger compounds is
antimony. Its melting point of 630° is too high for
it to be used pure, but it can be dissolved in bis-
muth in large amounts. An LiF-BeF -ThF  (72-16-
12 mole %) salt containing EuF , was added to a
graphite vessel containing Bi-Sb (79.4-20.6 mole %),
and small amounts of metallic thorium reductant
were added at 600 and 700°. Radiochemical anal-
ysis indicated that only about 0.4% of the europium
was extracted, but even this may be due to back-
ground; examination of the spectrum taken on a mul-
tichannel analyzer showed only background at the
prominent 355-kev peak of !352—154Eu, However,
four measurements were made of the lithium and
thorium distributions and the beryllium electrode
potential. Since no absolute beryllium potential
measurements have been made in this solvent, only

180

the standard potential difference can be determined.

In this system, 86

muth these potentials are —0.11 v and —0.28 v.
The addition of antimony to the metal phase has
further lowered the activities of both lithium and
thorium. Though the data are not extensive enough
to make these values very accurate, it seems that
the thorium activity was lowered more than the
lithium.

In a similar experiment, an LiF-BeF -ThF4 salt
(65-23-12 mole %) containing Cer was extracted
with Bi-Sb (79.4-20.6 mole %). Thorium and lithium
were used as reductants. Potential readings were
not taken. The cerium distribution, however, was
measurable. It was less than half that obtained in
pure bismuth with this salt. At both 600 and 700°,
the separation factor (D .o/D 1) was about 0.4 at
the thorium solubility limit (which was perhaps
twice the reported solubility in bismuth). Table
13.3 shows these distributions. The lithium-tho-
rium equilibrium constant made no sense unless
equal valences were assumed for both metals; so
no comparison with the europium experiment could
be made. The conclusion compiled from these two
experiments is that 21% antimony in bismuth does
indeed lower the activities of the electropositive
metals but it seems to go in the wrong direction,
lowering the thorium activity more than the rare
earth. Antimony does not look like a good additive.

Gold is the most electronegative metal. Three
weight percent gold was added to bismuth in the
extraction of neodymium from LiF-BeF -ThF  (68-
20-12 mole %) at 600 and 700°. A pure 147Nd
tracer was prepared by irradiation of a separated
stable isotope. The average values of the equi-
librium constants are:

The thorium distribution at saturation at 600° was
0.037 rather than the 0.021 in pure bismuth. This
leads to a maximum neodymium distribution of 0.05
and a separation factor of 1.33. Thorium saturation
was apparently not reached at 700°, but a D4 of
0.104 was found. The distribution of neodymium
between the salt and pure bismuth is not yet known.
However, an experiment now in progress using LiF-
Ber-ThF4 (72-16-12 mole %) indicates that the
maximum D _ . is 0.050 at 600° and 0.132 at 700°.
This latter is a more favorable salt for rare-earth
extraction. If D, (salt B)/D 4 (salt A) equals
D.. (salt B)/DCe (salt A), then in the 72-16-12
salt we would expect D 4 with the bismuth-gold
system to be 0.079 at 600° and at least 0.163 at
700°, This is significant improvement even though
the separation factor has been slightly reduced.
The effect of gold concentration and of chemically
similar but less precious additives is an object of
studies to be made,

13.3 PROTACTINIUM STUDIES IN THE HIGH-
ALPHA MOLTEN-SALT LABORATORY

C. J. Barton R. G. Ross
In the previous report® it was shown that the prot-

actinium distribution that occurred when a single-
region fuel composition LiF-Ber-ThF4 (72-16-12
mole %) was equilibrated with a bismuth-thorium
alloy was less favorable than when the salt phase
was the blanket composition LiF-BeF 2-ThF‘4 (73-
2-25 mole %). This difference in protactinium be-
havior was apparently due to an unexplained fairly

rapid loss of thorium from the bismuth phase in the
single-region fuel experiments.

Two theories that have been offered to explain
the loss of metallic thorium were tested in experi-
ments reported here. These are formation of tho-
rium carbide and thorium oxide.

13.3.1 Tests Dealing with the Possibility
of Thorium Carbide Formation

In one experiment 850 g of bismuth containing
4.25 g of thorium, part of which was irradiated to
provide a tracer concentration of 233Pa, was heated
to 630°C in a graphite-lined nickel pot. During the
early part of the equilibration period when the bis-
muth was stirred with 200 cm3/min of helium, the
233Pa concentration in filtered samples increased
sharply to a maximum in the 6-hr sample. In the
next 16 hr there was a sharp drop in 233Pa concen-
tration to 43% of the maximum value. There was a
lower rate of decrease in the 233Pa during the next
70 hr when the cover gas was changed to static
helium, thus indicating possible contamination of
the helium with oxygen or water vapor. Variations
in the thorium concentration in filtered bismuth
samples were also noted, with a maximum value of
1680 ppm being attained, but all samples contained
less thorium than the literature or than our previous
experiments would predict. A graphite specimen
exposed for 24 hr in the bismuth-thorium alloy was
examined by x-ray diffraction. No evidence of car-
bide formation was found, and most of the thorium
was accounted for by analyses of the bismuth ingot
and the samples that were removed. We concluded
that this experiment provided no indication of tho-
rium carbide formation at 630°C.

The next experiment was conducted in a mild-
steel-lined pot using 250 g of LiF-BeF‘z-ThF4 (72-
16-12 mole %) and 300 g of Bi-Th alloy (0.64 wt %
Th). The protactinium balance in this experiment
was poor, except for the early samples, and dropped
to a low of 20% after 16 hr of contact. The max-
imum concentration of protactinium in the bismuth
was 23% of the total. The principal difference be-
tween this experiment and similar experiments con-
ducted in graphite was that the thorium concentra-
tion in bismuth dropped from its initial value of
1860 ppm to zero in the first hour. This was a
much faster rate of loss than we found in the
graphite experiments. However, the protactinium
concentration in both filtered and unfiltered salt
samples continued to drop for 16 hr indicating that

181

the insoluble thorium was still effective in reducing
protactinium. The uranium content of filtered bis-
muth ranged from 47 to 57%, and the uranium bal-
ance was much better than that of protactinium. It
appears that mild steel has no advantage over
graphite as a container for liquid-metal—-single-
region-fuel-salt equilibration experiments.

13.3.2 Tests Dealing with the Possibility
of Oxide Contamination

There were no obvious differences in technique
between the very successful experiment with a
blanket composition as the salt phase (run 1-8) and
subsequent less successful experiments with
single-region fuel. We made a number of improve-
ments in our experimental technique to reduce the
possibility of oxide contamination, and we decided
to repeat run 1-8 under current glove box conditions
to try to confirm our belief that the difference in
salt composition, rather than faulty experimental
technique, was the cause of different protactinium
distributions. The resulting experiment (run 6-11)
gave very encouraging results. The protactinium
distribution data in Fig. 13.4 show that after 18 1/2
hr of phase contact, 58% of the protactinium was in
the filtered bismuth and 35% in the filtered salt,
making a total of 93%. The insoluble protactinium
making up the balance was in the bismuth., Addi-
tion of more metallic thorium to the system removed
about two-thirds of the protactinium that remained
in the salt after 194 hr contact with the initial bis-
muth-thorium alloy, but this fraction of the reduced
protactinium did not appear in either the filtered or
unfiltered samples. The thorium concentration in
bismuth, also shown in Fig. 13.4, underwent an ini-
tial rapid drop of greater magnitude than expected
from the concentration of uranium and protactinium
(50 and 7 ppm respectively) initially present in the
salt phase, but the rate of loss after the first hour
was slow in comparison with that observed in ex-
periments with single-region fuel salt.

The distribution of uranium in this experiment
(Fig. 13.5) was similar to that of protactinium ex-
cept that the thorium added after 19, hr contact
caused an increase in the uranium concentration in
bismuth as well as a decrease in the salt-phase
concentration. The uranium balance was near 100%.
The drop in protactinium balance following the ad-
dition of thorium (Fig. 13.4) probably indicates that
part of the protactinium coprecipitated with insol-
uble bismuth-thorium intermetallic compounds.

Run 6-11-68.
Comparison of the data in Figs. 13.4 and 13.5
with data® from run 1-8 shows that reduction and
transfer of uranium or protactinium to the bismuth
phase was much slower in the recent experiment.
We found that the graphite dip leg had broken at the
point where the graphite was sealed to Y -in, nickel
tubing. Consequently, gas mixing of the phases
was not effected, and this undoubtedly accounted
for the slow rate of reduction and transfer of ura-
nium and protactinium.

It seems clear from this experiment that we can
transfer a large fraction of uranium and protactinium
from a blanket salt composition to a bismuth-tho-
rium alloy and that thorium loss from the bismuth is
much less than that from an alloy equilibrated with
single-region fuel.

In this experiment we again demonstrated that
protactinium and uranium can be returned to solu-
tion in the molten salt by HF-H _ treatment in a mix-
ture containing bismuth. After the re-solution part
of the experiment was completed, we treated the
mixture with hydrogen and then added enough tho-
rium turnings to make a 1% Th-Bi alloy. The prot-
actinium concentration in the filtered salt was down
to about 3% of its initial value 30 hr after adding
thorium, but a maximum of 19% was found in the
bismuth. Protactinium and uranium balances were
poorer than in the first part of the experiment, due
possibly to the formation of insoluble bismuth-tho-
rium compounds.

We further tested the oxide-contamination theory
by conducting an experiment with the single-region
fuel composition LiF-Ber-ThF4 (72-16-12 mole %)
in which we took many precautions to prevent any
oxygen from entering the apparatus. The entire
system was carefully leak tested and pumped for
24 hr at room temperature, the traps were pumped
overnight at about 100°, the system was operated
at a helium pressure of 12 psig, the apparatus was
heated initially under vacuum, and crystal-bar tho-
rium was used as the reducing agent in place of
thorium turnings.

The protactinium distribution in this experiment
(run 7-2), shown in Fig. 13.6, indicated very little
reduction during the first 30-hr equilibration period,
a little more reduction during the 22-hr period fol-
lowing the addition of more crystal-bar thorium,
and, finally, a substantial increase in protactinium

quite similar to the protactinium data. The thorium
metal content of filtered bismuth samples, also
shown in Fig. 13.6, was quite low. This accounts
for the slowness of reduction but raises the pres-
ently unanswered question of why the thorium did
not dissolve in bismuth. Nickel was present as an
impurity in the bismuth, resulting from splashing of
the bismuth on nickel tubing well above the liquid
level. Although there was evidence that insoluble
nickel-thorium intermetallic compounds were formed,
comparison of the results of this experiment with
data obtained in the latter part of run 6-11, where
the nickel concentration was more than ten times as
high as in the present experiment, makes it seem
unlikely that the nickel impurity alone could ac-
count for the low thorium solubility. It is known
that crystal-bar thorium dissolves more slowly than
turnings, and it appears that the reaction, whatever
it may be, that converted the thorium into a form in-
soluble in the bismuth proceeded more rapidly when
the metal was present as a pure solid phase than
when it was dissolved in bismuth.
13.3.3 Experiment with Molybdenum Container

The final experiment, and the most successful we
have conducted to date with single-region fuel salt,
was performed in a molybdenum-lined vessel con-
taining a molybdenum dip leg. Chemical Tech-
nology workers had previously demonstrated® the
compatibility of the material involved in this ex-
periment, as reported elsewhere in this report. The
experiment has been completed, but only prelim-

inary data are available at present for most samples.

The salt mix, which included 255 g of LiF-BeF -
ThF4 (72-16-12 mole %), 3.003 g of depleted UF,
25 mg of 23!Pa, 1 mc of 233Pa, and 1 mc of °°Fe,
was purified as usual in a nickel vessel by H,-HF
treatment followed by H, for 167 hr and purified
argon for 27 hr. The purified salt mix was then
transferred through a fritted nickel filter into the
molybdenum-lined vessel containing 291 g of H -HF
treated bismuth and 2.798 g of crystal-bar thorium.

Protactinium distribution data, together with tho-
rium concentrations found in the bismuth, are given
in Fig. 13.7. It is apparent that reduction of UF,
and PaF  was not complete when the first samples
were taken about 3‘/4 hr after mixing of the phases.

Purified argon was bubbled through the mixture at

a very slow rate (approximately 50 ml/min), and the
mixing was less vigorous than in earlier experi-
ments. The protactinium concentration in the 2,2-hr
bismuth sample, based on the ?33Pa count on the
solid sample, the most reliable value available for
this particular sample, was a little higher than
counts obtained with subsequent samples indicated.
The argon gas flow was shut off shortly after taking
the 2.3-hr salt sample, and the vessel was main-
tained under a positive pressure of argon for a
period of 90 hr. Argon was then allowed to flow
through the vessel at 50 ml/min for two days and
then helium at the same rate for another day. As
the data in Fig. 13.7 show, the protactinium con-
centration in both salt and bismuth remained vir-
tually unchanged from 19 hr to the end of the equili-
bration period. The importance of the helium test
is that it indicates that our helium supply is almost
certainly free of oxygen impurities. The only puri-
fication treatment that it had received was passage
through charcoal cooled with dry ice, and no change
in protactinium distribution resulted from its use.

After having confirmed the long-term stability of
protactinium in bismuth contained in molybdenum,
we treated the mixture with H, and HF to oxidize
and dissolve the metallic uranium, protactinium,
and thorium in the salt. This was followed by hy-
drogen reduction and by argon sparging to remove
HF. We then repeated the thorium reduction
process, but this time we added the thorium in in-
crements, allowing about 24 hr between additions,
with gentle argon flow to mix the phases, to assure
that equilibrium was reached. The protactinium
distribution data are presented in Fig. 13.8 as a
function of weight of thorium added. The calcu-
lated weights of the phases at the first addition of
thorium were 212 g for the salt and 177 g for the
metal. As the data in Fig. 13.8 demonstrate, the
protactinium content of the phases remained essen-
tially unchanged until the thorium added was suffi-
cient to reduce nearly all the uranium. The salt
samples removed after the first two additions of
thorium had a distinctly bluish color, indicative of
the presence of UF3. The final thorium addition,
which brought the thorium concentration in the bis-
muth above the saturation value, caused a drop in
the protactinium concentration in bismuth. The fact
that this loss of soluble protactinium was due to
coprecipitation of this element with an insoluble
thorium-bismuth compound was shown by raising
the temperature to 800° to dissolve all the thorium.

The protactinium concentration in bismuth returned
to the value predicted by extrapolating the curve.
Somewhat surprisingly, the protactinium concentra-
tion in the salt phase increased significantly at the
same time. Returning the temperature to its normal
level (630°C) dropped the protactinium concentra-
tion in the salt back to about its previous value but
resulted in only a slight drop in the protactinium
concentration in the bismuth.

calculated for this experiment was about 1570 with
a thorium concentration in the bismuth of 1400 ppm.
This value is considerably lower than data re-
ported® by other investigators would indicate; but
since their data show considerable scatter in the
calculated Q value, it is not clear whether the dif-
ference in distribution coefficients between their
experiments and ours is significant. We will get
additional values for this quotient when the re-
maining samples from the experiment are analyzed.

13.3.4 Conclusions

1. Molybdenum is a suitable container material
for equilibration of single-region fuel compositions
with bismuth-thorium alloys, as reported by other
investigators.

2. There is no solid evidence that either thorium
carbide or thorium oxide formation is responsible
for the loss of thorium from liquid bismuth-thorium
alloys contacted with the single-region salt LiF-
BeF -ThF, (72-16-12 mole %) in a graphite con-
tainer. Presently available data indicate the possi-
bility of Th-Be-C compounds.

3. Graphite is a suitable container for equilibra-
tion of the blanket salt LiF-Ber-ThF4 (73-2-25
mole %) with bismuth-thorium alloys.

4. Uranium and protactinium can be readily trans-
ferred from solution in bismuth to molten salts by
treatment with HF.

5. The solubility of thorium in bismuth saturated
with nickel is much less than in pure bismuth.
14. Development and Evaluation of Analytical Methods

for Molten-Salt Reactors

14.1 DETERMINATION OF OXIDE IN
MSRE SALTS

R. F. Apple J. M. Dale
A. S. Meyer

Because the earlier analyses by the hydrofluori-
nation method® had established that a low and es-
sentially constant concentration of oxide could be
maintained in the MSRE fuel, the determination of
oxide in the reactor salt samples was assigned a
lower priority during this period of operation. The
results of the two oxide analyses performed on the
fuel are reported in Table 14.1. Also included for
comparison are the results obtained for an earlier
sample (FP-7-9) whose analysis was deliberately
delayed to accentuate the effects of radiation and
the average result of all fuel analyses since the
reactor achieved power operation.

While the reproducibility (8 ppm absolute) of
the combined sampling and analysis procedure is
quite satisfactory, the accuracy of the method for
radioactive samples is difficult to establish. A
possible source of error is the loss of oxygen via
evolution by radiolytic fluorine that is generated

during the approximately 8-hr interval between
sampling and analysis. Sample FP-14-53 was
transported in a carrier designed to maintain the
sample at a temperature above SO0°F to eliminate
the radiolytic generation of fluorine. Because of
a crowded sampling schedule it was not possible
to perform repeated analyses on samples trans-
ported in the heated carrier before the scheduled
reactor shutdown. The absence of any significant
differences between the results of a sample handled
to minimize and that handled to maximize the ef-
fects of radiation, together with the overall re-
producibility, strongly suggests that the activity
of the samples introduces no determinate error in
the method.

During the period when the reactor was not in
operation, the hydrofluorination apparatus was
used to analyze a number of radioactive and non-
radioactive samples. Solvent salt samples for the
In-Pile Test Loop were analyzed in an eifort to
determine the source of oxide contamination. The
results are summarized below:

Sample 1 was taken from the original salt prepara-
tion. Sample 2 was exposed in the molten state
for 96 hr to the atmosphere of a helium-filled dry
box. Samples 3 through 5 were purged, in series,
with helium for 48 hr.

The method was also adapted to smaller samples
which were taken to determine the completeness
of removal of oxide from fuel concentrates (LiF-
233UF4) by batch hydrofluorination. The results
are given in Table 14.2.

The first five analyses were run to establish
the optimum sampling techniques for the process-
ing equipment on samples from a test preparation
of concentrate prepared from normal uranium. This

development work was performed with G. I. Cathers. 2

Initial samples were taken in a special sampling
system designed to withdraw a filtered sample in

a small copper ladle. It was necessary either to
transfer the sample to a standard ladle or to couple
a copper sleeve to the ladle to ensure that HF-H,

mixture bubbled through the molten sample. To
provide larger and more representative samples,
the molten salt was drawn into a 1/2-'1n.-OD
Inconel tube. After freezing, 1-in. sections cut
from the salt-filled tube were taken for analysis.
These sections were placed in standard ladles
that were prefitted with a welded delivery tube
which extended to the bottom of the ladle. After
the usual prehydrofluorination at 300°C, the
sample was melted and allowed to flow to the
bottom of the ladle for efficient purging. The
results confirm the effectiveness of the preliminary
hydrofluorination step in the removal of surface
contamination from atmospheric exposure.

The evaluation of the effects of radiation on the
components of the hydrofluorination apparatus is
of considerable interest because of plans to adapt
the technique to the in-line analysis of radioactive
salt streams. In general, the experience has been
satisfactory. In this period, the third year of
operation, the repair of in-cell components was
needed on only three occasions. Two of these
failures — leaks in the remote coupler resulting
from the corrosion of nickel ball joints by fumes
from an adjacent cell and an open circuit in the
valve-compartment heater system — do not appear
to be associated with radiation damage. The cause
of the desensitization of the electrolytic moisture-
monitor cell, the third since the apparatus was
installed, is subject to question. The first and
last (present) of these cells, which were used

primarily for the analysis of samples of relatively
low radioactivity, survived at least 20 analyses
and an 8-month service life. Conversely, the

other cells, which were used for samples taken
during extended power operation, failed after 4

to 10 analyses and 2- to 4-month usage.

All failures have been of the same general type:
plastic components exhibited some evidence of
noncritical radiation damage, and the P,0, electro-
lyte was removed from the electrodes. In an at-
tempt to reproduce these failures under controlled
conditions, a moisture-monitor cell was operated
in the vertical position at 65°C. After the repeated
analysis of a series of relatively large SnO,
standards had failed to reduce the cell’s efficiency,
it was removed and subjected to ~107 rads of °°Co
radiation. The irradiated cell continued to func-
tion for several months and finally was desensitized
after the passage of a total of about 1.5 g of water.
This treatment represents an exposure to both
radiation and water that is at least an order of
magnitude greater than that which produced in-
cell failure. Although the in-cell failures may have
been due to the characteristics of the individual
moisture monitors, it is desirable to investigate
other techniques for the measurement of water for
application to in-line oxide analysis of molten-
salt reactor fuels.

14.2 DETERMINATION OF URANIUM(III) IN
RADIOACTIVE MSRE FUEL BY A
HYDROGEN-REDUCTION METHOD

J. M. Dale A. S. Meyer
R. F. Apple J. E. Caton
C. M. Boyd

The theory of this method® and the initial evalua-
tion of the experimental results* have been pre-
viously described. It was noted at that time that
the results of the U%* determinations did not re-
flect the beryllium additions which had been made
to the MSRE fuel salt for the purpose of reducing
fractional percentages of the U** to U®", How-
ever, the computer program which was used for
the initial evaluation of the experimental results

did not take into account the change in equilibrium
concentrations of the corrosion products and
uranium that must occur when the fuel is cooled
from reactor temperature to the temperature at
which the first hydrogen reduction step was made.
As a result, the values previously reported for the
U3 " concentrations were those in equilibrium at
500°C, the temperature of the first reduction step,
and not the U3 " concentrations present at 663°C,
the temperature of the fuel in the reactor.

The computer program has since been modified
and the experimental results reevaluated. The
new ratios of U3 " to total U are plotted in Fig.
14.1 and are compared with the calculated ratios
that would be expected to exist by virtue of the
beryllium additions and the fuel burnup. After
the first sample was run, a rod of beryllium metal
was lowered into the fuel in the reactor. The
beryllium is oxidized by the fuel; this reaction
produces an increase in the U3 " concentration.

All of the increases in the calculated U3 " con-
centrations are a result of more beryllium addi-
tions and corrosion of chromium, whereas the
decreases are a result of fuel burnup. The analysis
of the sixth and seventh samples gave HF yields
in the hundreds of micromoles, which has no cor-
relation with U3” concentration. At this point,
difficulty was experienced with the sampler sta-
tion, and the reactor was shut down for about a
month and a half for maintenance. The first two
U3* results determined after the reactor was
brought back to power were close to the calculated
values, and the result for the third sample was low.
At this point the reactor was down again for a

short time, and the next U3* result increased in
value but was still lower than the estimate. One
explanation for the low U®* results is that they

are a result of the radiolytic production of fluorine.
This hypothesis was discussed in a previous semi-
annual report.* In order to eliminate this source
of error, a heated sample carrier was made to trans-
port the fuel samples from the reactor to the hot-
cell facilities. The carrier maintains the tempera-
ture of the sample at about S00°F in order to
eliminate any fluorine production. Due to sampling
problems at the reactor, only one U?® ¥ sample
transported in the heated container was taken be-
fore the final reactor shutdown. The U®” result
for this sample was low compared with the cal-
culated value. However, because of the experi-
mental difficulties of this method, it would be un-
wise to place too much credence in any single
analytical result.

Work was continued on the development of the
method for the remote measurement of ppm con-
centrations of HF in helium and in hydrogen gas
streams.® The construction and calibration of the
dual trapping system for the continuous absorp-
tion and desorption of HF on sodium fluoride were
completed. The trapping system consists of a dual
selector valve, a special Monel thermal conductivity
cell (Gow Mac model 9454) with nickel filaments,
and two sodium fluoride traps. The valve and
thermal conductivity cell are contained in a model
1078 Boekel laboratory oven at 50°C and are con-
nected to the sodium fluoride traps, which are
mounted on the outside walls. This arrangement
permits the simultaneous absorption of HF on one

trap at room temperature and the desorption of
HF from the alternate trap at 300°C by means
of self-resistance heating. Figure 14.2 shows
the response curve of a typical thermal con-
ductivity cell for the desorption of HF from a
sodium fluoride trap. The initial smaller peak
is due to a small amount of water impurity and
is almost completely resolved from the HF peak.
As shown in Fig. 14.3, integration of the thermal
conductivity cell response vs the number of
micromoles of HF desorbed from the traps is
linear over the range of interest (1 to 50 micro-
moles of HF). This range comesponds to an HF
concentration of about 8 to 400 ppm at a carrier-
gas flow of 100 cc/min and an absorption period
of 30 min.

When this trapping system forthe U? ¥ determi-
nations is installed in the hot-cell facilities, it

will be necessary to have some means to check
periodically for any deterioration in the thermal-
conductivity-cell response. We have found that
the sampling of a helium gas stream will serve for
this purpose. At a cell current of 270 ma and a
flush-gas flow of 100 cc/min, the agreement of the
cell responses for repetitive samplings of a pure
helium gas stream was better than 0.1%. A 10%
change in the flush-gas flow causes a change in
the cell response of only 1%.

Provisions are now being made to use the trap-
ping system for the analysis of the HF evolved
from the hydrogen reduction of standard fuel salt
mixtures. This analysis should provide a check
of the validity of the hydrogen reduction method
and reveal any of its limitations.

The established hydrogen evolution method? is
not applicable to radioactive samples, because it

requires a finely powdered sample, and no facilities

are available to pulverize radioactive samples
under a controlled atmosphere. A modification of
this technique is being developed in which an un-
pulverized solid sample is dissolved in a sealed

tube in an HCI-HBO3 mixture. We have demonstrated

that 250-mg fragments of fuel, solvent, and fuel
concentrate are completely disintegrated by a 24-
hr treatment at 250°C. The sealed tube is pro-
tected by an overpressure of CO, during the dis-
solution. In the hot-cell determination the evolved
hydrogen will be mixed with a standard addition

of helium, and the H,/He ratio will be determined
mass spectrographically. To simulate the hot-

cell operation, samples were added to a tube that
was fitted with a breakseal and that contained a
thin-walled ampul of deaerated acid. The tube was
evacuated and sealed off by using a small (~300 w)
platinum-wound furnace. The acid ampul was then
broken by shaking, and the dissolution was com-
pleted successfully. Since all these operations
appear to be feasible by remote manipulation, an
apparatus is being fabricated to perform the dis-
solutions and standard additions of helium within
the hot cell.

14.4 DISPROPORTIONATION OF
ELECTROCHEMICALLY GENERATED
U(V) IN LiF-BeF ,-ZrF ,° AT 500°C

D. L. Manning Gleb Mamantov’

Uranium(IV) is oxidized to uranium(V) at a
pyrolytic graphite electrode and at platinum—10%
thodium at ~+1.2 v vs a platinum quasi-reference
electrode. The voltammograms are characteristic
of catalytic waves, that is, a charge transfer
followed by a chemical reaction. This is evidenced
by: (1) No voltammetric currents occur that are
due to the reduction of U(V) at slow scan rates
(V << 1 v/sec), and (2) the peak currents for the
oxidation of U(IV) and rereduction of U(V) are
approximately equal at fast scan rates (V >>1 v/
sec). Forthe uranium case, this appears to be an
oxidation step followed by a second-order dispro-
portionation where

scan rate, v/sec. The mathematical treatment of
Nicholson and Shain, however, is not applicable
to the uranium reaction. Fischer and Dracka®’
applied a chronopotentiometric method to the study
of the U(V) disproportionation in aqueous solutions.
Well-defined chronopotentiograms were obtained
at a PGE for the oxidation of U(IV) in molten LiF-
BeF ,-ZtF, at 500°C. The results were plotted
as i,7'/% vs i2/% according to Fischer and Dracka,
where 1, = current density, amp/cm 2 and 7 = transi-
tion time, sec. For a melt where concentration of
U(IV) equals 0.063 x 10~ 3 moles/cm? and electrode
area (4) = 0.1 cm?, the transition times ranged
from about 2 sec to 1.5 msec when the current
density (i) was varied from 0.01 to 0.12 amp/cm?.
The rate constant, k, according to Fischer and
Dracka is given by the equation

377A
k=——,

where A =1 72 and S = —(A I 71/2/&3/3).
The rate constant, k, has the units liters mole™
sec”'. For the uranium system the i, 71/2 values
were scattered, particularly at the longer transi-
tion times. By making several runs, however,
qualitative trends could be observed. For the

i, 7'/% vs i2/° plot, an average line through the
points exhibited a negative slope at the lower
ig/S values and became horizontal at the larger
values, in agreement with Fischer and Dracka’s
prediction. Because of the poor reproducibility,
particularly at the longer transition times, the
rate constant may only be stated as ™~ 160 liters
mole™ ! sec™?! (at 500°C). Again, the effect of
cylindrical diffusion was found to be negligible
according to the criteria of Peters and Lingane. !
It is believed that the poor reproducibility is
caused in part by the attack of UF, probably
produced in the disproportionation reaction, on
the electrode material.

In view of the catalytic nature of the U(IV) -
U(V) electrode reaction, this reaction is less
useful analytically than the U(IV) » U(II)
electrode reaction. It is also interesting to note
that although the crystalline fluoride complexes

of U(V) are stable at 350 to 400°C,*? an increase
in temperature to 500°C, accompanied by a change
to a liquid phase and a medium of relatively low
free fluoride ion activity, results in the decomposi-
tion of U(V).

14.5 EXCHANGE CURRENT MEASUREMENTS
ON THE NICKEL-NICKE L(Il) COUPLE IN
MOLTEN FLUORIDES

Howard Jenkins®? D. L. Manning
Gleb Mamantov’

Work has continued on the development of a
practical reference electrode for use in molten
fluorides. In the course of this work, it became
desirable to obtain additional quantitative data
on the reversibility of the Ni(II) + 2e > Ni electrode
reaction. It was decided to use one of the relaxa-
tion methods, since a fast charge transfer was ex-
pected on the basis of available kinetic data in
other molten-salt solvents. The voltage-step
method of Vielstich and Delahay '* was selected
primarily due to the simplicity of the instrumenta-
tion. The experimental procedure was similar to
that of Laitinen, Tischer, and Roe,!> who applied
the method to the study of kinetic constants in
molten chlorides.

The experimental setup for containing the melt
was described previously.'® The circuit for the
voltage step is essentially that of Laitinen,
Tischer, and Roe. Two mercury relays (Clare HG
1003) were used to make sure that the short cir-
cuit between the electrodes was broken before
applying the voltage step, usually 4 mv. The
oscilloscope (Tektronix 549) used for recording
the current-time curves is triggered by the signal

ing electrodes of nickel (4 ~ 7 x 1072 cm?) both
unsheathed and sheathed in boron nitride were
utilized.

In the voltage step method, the Faradaic current
observed after the charging current has become
negligible is extrapolated back to zero time. The
exchange current, io, is calculated from the equa-
tion

io _ E 1t=0 )
nFA(-V —1i,_R.)

where 1,_ is the ‘“‘zero time’’ current, V is the
known voltage step, and R . is the total resistance
of the system. The kinetic constants for the
nickel-nickel(I) couple are shown in Table 14.3.

Kinetic constants for metal—metal-ion systems
in molten fluoride solvents are for the most part
nonexistent. Therefore comparisons are not pos-
sible, although it is believed that the reported
values are of the correct order of magnitude. The
exchange current is, in essence, a measure of the
ability of a metal-metal-ion couple to pass current
without becoming polarized. In view of the value
obtained for nickel, and since high-impedance
potential-measuring devices are normally used, it
does not appear that the molar exchange current
value for the Ni-Ni(II) couple imposes a restric-
tion on its utilization as a reference electrode
system.

14.6 VOLTAMMETRIC STUDIES OF CHROMIUM(II)
IN MOLTEN LiF-BeF ,-ZrF , AT 500°C

D. L. Manning J. M. Dale

The electrochemical reduction of Cr(II) to Cr(0)
was studied in molten LiF-Ber—ZrF4 (65.6-29.4-
5.0 mole %) by voltammetry with linearly varying

potential. Well-defined voltammograms were ob-
tained with pyrolytic graphite and glassy carbon
indicator electrodes at a potential of about —0.9 v
vs an Ni-NiF reference electrode. Linear plots
of peak current (i ) vs concentration were ob-
tained over the concentration range studied, 0.008
to ~0.03 F Cr(II). Linear plots of ip vs (scan
rate) !’/ 2 obeyed the Randles-Sevcik equation from
about 0.02 to 1 v/sec. The diffusion coefficient
calculated from the slope of the line is of the
order of 1 x 107°% cm?/sec at 500°C. In the
presence of U(IV), the chromium wave is enhanced,
because the chromium reduction occurs at the foot
of the U(IV) - U(III) reduction wave.

In cooperation with T. R. Mueller of the Analyti-
cal Instrumentation Group, a first-derivative cir-
cuit was assembled for the controlled-potential,
controlled-current cyclic voltammeter. The use of
the derivative circuit resulted in much better resolu-
tion of the chromium waves in the presence of ura-
nium; however, the derivative peak current for the
Cr(II) » Cr(0) reduction was still enhanced by U(IV).

From the results obtained so far, it is believed
that the chromium reduction wave can be utilized
analytically to monitor chromium in fluoride melts;
in the presence of U(IV) it could be useful on an
empirical basis.

14.7 DEVELOPMENT OF A MOLTEN-SALT
SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC FACILITY FOR
HOT.CELL USE

J. P. Young

In cooperation with personnel of Cary Instru-
ments, Varian Associates, work has continued on
the design of a system with an extended optical
path!” which will permit spectrophotometric

17J. P. Young, MSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept.
Aug. 31, 1967, ORNL-4191, p. 171.
studies of samples of radioactive MSRE fuel.

The scope of the project has broadened somewhat,
and the facility will make use of an extended
double-beam arrangement. Both sample and
reference beams will pass into and out of the hot
cell; the spectrophotometer itself will be outside
the cell.

The conceptual optical design of the extended
light beams has been completed by the vendor of
the spectrophotometer, but a contract for its de-
tailed design and construction has not yet been
completed.

The facility can be used with solid, liquid, or
gaseous samples at temperatures up to ~800°C.
As pointed out previously, the facility is designed
primarily for use with molten fluoride salts and
will be used to demonstrate the spectrophotometric
determination of U(III) in MSRE fuels, LiF«BeFZ-
ZtF ,-UF,, which contain U(IV).

Equipment has been designed and techniques
are being developed so that a sample of fuel can
be taken from the MSRE reactor and divided into
several (up to five) portions, and the portions can
be transferred individually to a spectrophotometric
furnace assembly for melting without any exposure
to the atmosphere or to temperatures below 200°C
for periods longer than 30 min. Exclusion of air
is necessary to prevent the possible reaction of
U(III) with H,0 and/or O,. An elevated tempera-
ture is required to prevent the radiolytic evolution
of fluorine, which would alter the oxidation state
of uranium on remelting the sample.

The apparatus required for this sample transfer
has been designed with the assistance of F. L.
Hannon and E. F. Marguerat (General Engineering
Division, ORNL). It consists of six separate com-
ponents: (1) sample ladle, which removes a 5-g
molten-salt sample from the pump bowl of the
reactor; (2) transport container, which receives the
sample ladle and maintains it under inert gas; (3)
heated transfer carrier, which receives the trans-
port container, provides radiation shielding
during transfer of the sample from reactor to hot
cell, and heats the sample to ~200°C during the
transfer; (4) sample-loading furnace, which receives
the transport container in the hot cell; within this
assembly the 5-g sample is melted and divided
into as many as five containers for spectrophoto-
metric study; (5) spectrophotometric fumace lid,
which fits both the sample-loading and spectro-
photometric furnaces; the lids receive the spectral
sample for transfer between the two furnaces; and

193

(6) spectrophotometric furnace, which receives the
sample for melting and spectral study.

All of these sample handling operations, of
sourse, must be carried out with manipulators be-
hind suitable shielding. The apparatus is de-
signed in such a way that the manipulations re-
quired at the reactor site fall within their routine
procedural requirements. At the hot cell the ap-
paratus can be operated and general maintenance
can be performed with master-slave manipulators.
All of these components except the sample-loading
furnace have been completely designed; com-
ponents 1, 2, 5, and 6 are presently being fabricated
for testing prior to hot-cell use. The orientation
of apparatus within the hot cell is being evaluated
so that all operations, sample handling, and
maintenance can be carried out properly. The
obvious applicability of this installation to other
types of samples is also considered in this design
work.

For spectral analysis in this facility, the ~0.5-g
molten fluoride sample will be contained in a modi-
fied captive-liquid cell adapted for remote-handling
techniques. As other sample-confinement techniques,
such as windowed cells, are developed to a point
where they can be used in a hot cell, they can be
interchanged in any part of the facility in which
windowless cells are presently being considered.

14.8 SPECTRA OF U(V) AND U(VI) SPECIES
IN MOLTEN FLUORIDE SALTS

J. P. Young

Spectral studies of U(V) and U(VI) in molten LiF-
BeF , have continued. This work is being carried
out in cooperation with G. I. Cathers, Chemical
Technology Division, who has prepared the solute
salt Na,UF by absorbing UF, on NaF pellets.

It was found that Na,UF,; at a temperature of 550°C
undergoes a rapid and vigorous reaction, possibly
with graphite, when it is in contact with molten
LiF-BeF , contained in a graphite windowless
spectrophotometric cell. A gas is evolved in the
process, and a clear and visually colorless solu-
tion results. The spectrum of this solution has
been identified as that of U(V). Over the wave-
length range of 250 to 2000 nm this spectrum of
U(V) consists of two overlap ping peaks centered
at 950 and 1240 nm and a sharp peak at 1465 nm
(molar absorptivities are approximately 6, 3, and
15 respectively). The U(V) solute species was
194

not stable and slowly converted to U(IV). The
molar absorptivities given above were calculated
from the measurement of the decrease of absorbance
of U(V) and the corresponding increase of U(IV)
and the known absorptivities of U(IV);!8 the as-
sumption was made that the only two uranium
species of any significant concentration in the
melt at any time were U(IV) and U(V). By means
of the sharp absorption peak at 1465 nm, it should
be possible to detect U(V) in MSR fuels at levels
of approximately 10% of the U(IV) concentration.

The loss of U(V) concentration appeared to follow
second-order kinetics in which the initial concen-
trations of the reacting species are equal. This
would suggest that the U(V) was lost by dispro-
portionation. At 550°C the rate constant was cal-
culated to be approximately 0.005 liter mole™!
sec™!. Second-order rate constants for the dis-
proportionation of U(V) at an electrode are orders
of magnitude larger.!® The large discrepancy in
the two values suggests that the disproportiona-
tion of electrochemically generated U(V) is catalyzed
on the surface of the electrode, whereas the dis-
proportionation measured spectrally is a bulk solu-
tion rate.

Solutions of Na,UF, in molten LiF-BeF, con-
tained in a windowless LaF , cell were studied
spectrally. Although LaF , has a slight solubility
in the solvent, this container material should not
be oxidized by U(VI), and indeed, no observable
reaction was seen in this melt, unlike the case
in graphite. Intense absorption in the ultraviolet
region was observed, with shoulders in the region
of 315 and 270 nm. Some U(IV) and U(V) were
observed, and apparently were produced by reac-
tion of U(VI) with impurities in the melt. The
addition of chromium metal to the melt caused
the disappearance of the ultraviolet absorption
and produced the partially interfering spectrum of
U(V) and U(IV). It is assumed that the initial
spectrum observed is that of a very low concen-
tration of U(VI) of the form UFn(G_")+. The ab-
sorbing species is not U022 * which has been ob-
served in other studies.?? It is also interesting
to note that no spectral evidence for UO2+ is ob-
served when UO2 2% is reduced by Fe?; only U(IV)
is produced. As a result of these studies, suf-

identify U(IIL), U(IV), U(V), and UO,?" and to

14.9 ABSORPTION SPECTRA OF SEVERAL 3d
TRANSITION METAL IONS IN MOLTEN
FLUORIDE SOLUTION

J. P. Young

Experimental work has been completed on a
spectral study of Fe(Il), Ni(II), Ct(II), and Cr(III)
in various molten fluoride salts. The results have
been submitted for publication. >’ The abstract of
the publication follows:

The spectra of several 3d transition metal ions,
Fe(II), Ni(II), Cr(II), and Cr(III), have been studied,
these ions were dissolved in several molten fluoride
salts which are essentially the stoichiometric mix-
ture Li,BeF, with and without excess F, as LiF.
The spectra were obtained in the temperature range
540 to 650°C; the samples were contained in graph-
ite windowless containers forthe study. Iron(Il)
exhibits a peak and shoulder absorbance envelope
with maximum absorbance at 9800 and 5500 cm™1.
Respective molar absorptivities are 4.5 and 3. The
spectrum appears unaffected by change in solvent
composition. The spectrum of Ni(II) at a tempera-
ture of 550°C consists of three peaks at 23,100,
10,800, and ca. 6000 cm~?!. Respective molar ab-
sorptivities are 11, 2, and ca. 1. The spectrum ap-
pears to be likewise unaffected by solvent change.
At a temperature of 550°C, Cr(II) appears to ex-
hibit one peak at 14,000 cm~—! with a molar ab-
sorptivity of 6; Cr(III) exhibits three peaks at
33,000, 22,600, and 14,500 cm~!; respective
molar absorptivities are ca. 10, 10, and 7. The
spectral results would suggest that, in general,
these ions are situated in O, symmetry in these
melts with little tendency to change if the ‘‘free’’
fluoride ion concentration is reduced over the
range studied. Iron(Il) is a possible exception to
this generality.

14.10 SIMULTANEOUS ELECTROCHEMICAL
AND SPECTROPHOTOME TRIC STUDY OF
SOLUTES IN MOLTEN FLUORIDE SALTS

F. L. Whiting?? J. P. Young
Gleb Mamantov’

The study of the electrochemical generation and
spectral identification of solute species in molten
fluoride salts!” has continued. It has been ap-
parent that melt impurities, primarily hydrolysis
products, must be absent for the generation of the
desired solute species.

Various methods for the purification of LiF-NaF-
KF have been attempted. The methods have in-
cluded treatment with HF and SiF, and a vacuum
pretreatment at 450°C.%? Of these methods, the
vacuum pretreatment proved to be the most effec-
tive. It was noted that the removal of HF from
molten LiF-NaF-KF was best achieved by evacuat-
ing the melt at 860°C, whereas SiF, was removed
at 500°C. Silicon tetrafluoride is highly soluble
in molten LiF-NaF-KF, and its dissolution is an
endothermic process. An increase in pressure and
changes in the forms of the voltammograms of the
melt indicated that the HF and SiF , had been re-
moved at the temperatures cited.

The reduction of Ta(V) in"molten LiF-NaF-KF
at a platinum electrode appears to be at least a
two-step process to the metal, as was reported by
Senderoff et al.2* Attempts to verify the reported
oxidation of Ta(V) to Ta(VI) have yielded incon-
clusive results.

The anodic dissolution of a copper electrode in
molten LiF-NaF-KF produces at least two oxida-
tion states of copper. An insoluble form of Cu(I)

was produced at +1.1 v vs the platinum quasi-ref-
erence electrode, and at +-1.35 v the production of a

soluble form of Cu(Il) is believed to occur. The
spectrum of Cu(Il) in molten LiF-NaF-KF, generated
electrochemically, consists of a band at 810 nm

and an unresolved charge-transfer band in the ultra-
violet region.

14.11 DEVELOPMENT OF A GAS
CHROMATOGRAPH FOR ANALYSIS
OF THE MSRE BLANKET GAS

C. M. Boyd A. S. Meyer

A helium breakdown voltage detector is being
studied for use in a gas chromatograph for the de-
termination of permanent-gas impurities in the
helium blanket gas of the MSRE. The breakdown
voltage of pure helium was of the order of 500 v
and was decreased ~ 50 v by 1-ppm concentration
of impurities. The minimum detectable limit of
impurities is controlled primarily by the helium
purity and the noise level in the detector. A
minimum noise level was obtained with a smooth
glow discharge on the anode probe. This condi-
tion was affected by the current level, amount of
contaminants, and the spacing and alignment of
the electrodes. Maximum sensitivity dictates the
use of very pure helium carrier gas, but this purity
level also causes a loss of the smooth glow dis-
charge and increases the noise level.

The addition of mercury vapor by the presence
of a small source of the metal in the tip of the
anode stabilized the discharge, but temperatures
above 50°C gave high concentrations of mercury
which greatly decreased the sensitivity of the
detector. A method of adding a smaller amount of
mercury vapor by passing a controlled flow of
helium through a heated tube containing HgO and
a catalyst (Fe203) was not completely successful,
due to the gradual increase in temperature re-
quired to maintain a constant evolution rate of
mercury.

A more practical solution of adding a contaminant
was sought. A 100-in. length of 0.004-in. capil-
lary was used to control the flow of a gas mixture
into the detector through the anode probe. When a
1000-ppm H,-in-He gas mixture was used, it was
difficult to maintain a constant low pressure on the
capillary for constant low flow rate. The use of a
100-ppm H2-in—He gas mixture allowed the use of
higher pressures which gave more constant flow
rates and less fluctuation in the helium breakdown
voltage. The hydrogen was not as effective as
mercury in stabilizing the discharge, but some
other gas may give an optimum effect. A 50-ppm
Xe-in-He gas mixture was tested, and xenon was
found to be ~ 10 times as effective as H,.

14.12 ANALY SIS OF MSRE HELIUM FOR
HYDROCARBONS

C. M. Boyd

A system for continuously measuring the total
hydrocarbon concentration in the radioactive off-
gas of the MSRE has been installed in the gas
sampling station. In this system (Fig. 14.4), the
reactor off-gas is passed through a combustion tube
that contains CuO maintained at 700°C. This
combustion converts hydrocarbons in the helium
to CO, and H,0. The oxidized gas stream is
passed through one side of a thermal-conductivity
(TC) cell, through a 3A molecular sieve—Ascarite—
Mg(Cl10,), trap, which removes the CO, and H,O,
and back through the reference side of the TC cell.
The difference between the thermal conductivity
of the gas in the two sides of the cell is a meas-
ure of the hydrocarbon concentration in the off-
gas, with detection limits of less than 10 ppm. A
length of brass tubing is installed upstream to the
reference side of the TC cell. After the gas
stream is switched by means of valves to bypass
the trap, a step response in the TC signal is ob-
tained. This plateau represents the period re-
quired to equilibrate the oxidized surface of the
brass tubing with moisture (Fig. 14.5). By use of
standard gas mixtures, it was demonstrated in a
laboratory system that the relative step heights
are proportional (within +10%) to the ratio of CO,
to H,0. Therefore an estimate of the ratio of
carbon to hydrogen in the reactor off-gas can be
made from such measurements.

The initial tests of the system on MSRE off-gas
have shown that the fission-product activity in
this stream causes serious interference. This
interference is largely the result of the radiolysis
of traces of absorbed water in the trap rather than

the radiolysis of the reagents themselves. The
contamination level is of the order of 100 ppm.
This level increased only slightly on oxidation,
indicating only about 10 ppm of combustibles.

Tests have been made on the materials con-
tained in the trap to determine the effect of radia-
tion. Samples (5 g) were sealed in 20-cc glass
vials filled with helium at 50 mm pressure and
were subjected to 2 x 107 rads of 6°Co radiation.
Mass spectrometry showed that hydrogen is the
major radiolysis product from Ascarite, while oxy-
gen was produced from both wet and dry samples
of Mg(Cl10,),. Wet molecular sieve gave some H,,
N2, CO, and 02. Dry molecular sieve produced
very little contaminant gas on irradiation. The
large trap that contained the combination of ab-
sorbing materials is being replaced with a small
trap that contains only molecular sieve. A heater
on this trap will keep it free of water and CO, by
a bakeout between tests. The amount of contami-
nant gases produced by radiolysis in this small
dry trap should be greatly decreased.

products that deposit on components (principally
the heat exchanger) of the MSRE. A knowledge of
the deposited fission products is important pri-
marily for estimation of the heat generated by the
fission products after reactor shutdown and for
purposes of remote maintenance. There is also
interest in the fission product distribution to de-
termine if correlations exist between the extent
of deposition and temperature gradients, molten-
salt chemistry, and fission-product precursor half-
life. In addition, there is a specific interest in
determining if °5Zr deposits.

Measurements of the fission products were made
by gamma spectrometry using a highly collimated
Ge(L1) diode. The collimator consisted of a lead
cylinder with a diameter of 19 in. and a length of
33.5in. The diode, in a small Dewar, was placed
in a cavity in the top of the shield over a col-
limator hole with a diameter of ' in. and a length
of 12 in. By means of the collimator the detector
could be focused on an area about 3 in. in diameter
on the reactor components (a source-to-detector
distance of 15 ft). Pulse-height spectra were
taken with a 400-channel analyzer. Measurements
were begun on March 28, 1968 (five days after
reactor shutdown) and continued at intervals over
a 12-day period.

The major fission products found in the heat
exchanger and input and output fuel salt lines of
the heat exchanger were 132Te-132], 103Ry, °9Mo,
and °5Nb. Minor amounts of 1°°Ru and !4°Ba-
1491a were found. Fission products detected in
the pump bowl and off-gas line included those
listed above and '4!Ce, !31] and !37Cs. No
°3Zr was detected. Quantitative results were ob-
tained in terms of curies per square inch of area
contacted by the fuel salt. The amounts of each
fission product deposited on the heat exchanger
increased slightly from the fuel-salt entry over
about the first foot of heat exchanger and then
decreased over the next 5 ft. Table 14.4 lists the
mean deposition values found in the heat ex-
changer for the fission products ®5Nb, °°Mo,
103Ry, and 132Te-132]. Table 14.4 also lists
the percent of total inventory for each fission
product. These values were obtained by multiply-
ing the mean deposition values by the total wet-
table metal surface in the MSRE and dividing by
the total curies of each fission product in the
MSRE at reactor shutdown time. More detailed
results from these experiments are given in Sect.

graphite. Cylindrical specimens were obtained
from blocks of graphite (removed from the reactor
in the spring of 1967 and March 1968), by core
drilling. These specimens were repeatedly sanded
to obtain samples (on emery paper) as a function
of depth in the graphite. The thickness of graphite
represented by the samples was varied from about
0.001 in. near the surface of the specimen to about
0.015 in. at a depth of about 1/2 in.

The first series of samples were measured by
Nal(Tl) spectrometry. The later series were meas-
ured by Ge(Li) diode spectrometry. The improved
resolution of the Ge diode permitted measurement
of 141Ce, 144Ce, 103Ry, 106Ry, 137Cg, 957,
95Nb, 132Te, 131] and 14°Ba-La. Previously,
resolution of the two cerium and ruthenium pairs
of radionuclides and °°Zr-?°Nb by Nal(Tl) spectrom-
etry was not possible.

Results were obtained in disintegrations per
second per sample for each radionuclide. It was
observed that the concentrations of fission products
decreased rapidly with distance in the graphite.

A notable finding was that the ratio of the dis-
integration rates of °°Nb to °5Zr was about 10 for
most samples. Since the samples had decayed for
198

several months, this fact indicates that °5Nb
penetrates MSRE graphite much more readily than
95Zr does.

The pyrolytic graphite after the surface sample
was removed contained considerably lower con-
centrations of fission products than MSRE graphite.
Also, 149Ba-La was not detected in the pyrolytic
graphite.

14.15 PRECISION ANALYSIS OF 235U BY
DELAYED-NEUTRON COUNTING

J. F. Emery

Since the original study of the determination of
2357 by delayed-neutron counting?’ a need has
arisen to improve the accuracy and precision of
the method for the analysis of the MSRE fuel
salt. This method is applicable to the analysis of
2337 also.

Several innovations in the technique resulted in
the improvement of the precision by a factor of 2.
A more reproducible decay time was obtained by
increasing the pressure of the air propelling the
“‘rabbit’’ from 10 psi to 20 psi. The irradiation
time was increased from 60 to 120 sec and the
decay time from 20 to 25 sec. Under these new
conditions, the total count is a little less de-
pendent on variations in the decay time. The
relative standard deviation on samples was im-
proved from 0.5 to 0.3%, while the relative standard
deviation for successive irradiation of a single
sample improved from 0.3 to 0.16%.

The electronic resolution of this system is still
the one single problem in improving the accuracy
of this method. A new current-sensitive pre-
amplifier has been developed by the Instrumenta-
tion and Controls Division which holds good
promise of improving the time resolution of this
system.

is capable of taking 20 polarograms of a single
solution in 25 min with a relative standard devia-
tion of 0.1%. Uranium peak heights of the deriva-
tive polarograms are measured as voltage on a
digital voltmeter, as it is virtually impossible to
measure a polarogram traced on a recorder chart
with this precision. Synthetic MSRE fuels have
been analyzed with a relative standard deviation
of 0.1%; however, a negative bias of approximately
0.5% has been observed. Use of the standard addi-
tion technique together with a maximum supressor
(Triton X) has not eliminated this negative bias.
W. L. Maddox recently found that a 60-cycle ac
signal is present in the electrode system. This
could account for the difficulty in obtaining ac-
curate results. The study will be resumed when
this ac pickup has been eliminated.

14.17 A PRECISE DETERMINATION OF
URANIUM IN MSRE FUEL

G. Goldberg L. T. Corbin

A unique method is under development to in-
crease the precision of the remote determination
of uranium in the MSRE fuel. The current method,
which consists of a direct measurement of uranium
in a sulfuric acid solution of the fuel by controlled-
potential coulometry, has a precision of about 1%.
It will be difficult to maintain this precision when
the concentration of uranium is reduced to 0.13
mole % for 233U operations. For optimum control
of the reactor by chemical analysis, the precision
should be approximately 0.1%.

The method under investigation is based on the
preliminary separation of the uranium from the
balance of the fuel by fluorination at 600°C and
collection of the UF  on a trap of NaF. The UF
and NaF are dissolved in a sulfuric acid—boric
acid mixture, and the uranium, now free from inter-
fering ions, is determined with a high-sensitivity
controlled-potential coulometric titrator. Pre-
liminary tests have shown that >99% of the
uranium can be volatilized from a 50-g fuel sample
in a 1-hr fluorination period. The coulometric
titration technique has been used in the laboratory
to determine uranium in solutions with a precision
of 0.1%.

In order to apply this method with the same de-
gree of precision to highly radioactive samples
which must be processed remotely in a hot-cell
facility, certain modifications were necessary.

A precision of better than 0.5% would be quite
difficult if it were necessary to pipet and titrate
an aliquot of the sample remotely within the hot
cell. Whether or not the trap which contains the
separated UF‘6 can be removed from the hot cell
for a more precise uranium determination depends
on the amount of radioactivity (e.g., ruthenium,
niobium, tellurium, iodine, etc.) carried over to
the trap. To reduce the high level of the activity,
a pre-trap containing NaF and heated to 400°C
was positioned between the fluorination reactor
and the collection trap. The UF is not retained
in the pre-trap at this higher temperature. Radio-
active ruthenium, niobium, tellurium, and iodine
were added to 50-g samples of simulated MSRE
fuel prior to fluorination. Results indicate that
only 1311 deposits in the collection trap in any
significant amounts along with the UF _.

A fluorination apparatus was constructed and
placed in a hot cell. The design is such that all
manipulations may be made with little or no dif-
ficulty within the cell. All gas-flow and tempera-
ture-adjustment controls are mounted outside and
at the front of the cell. Several runs were made
with simulated MSRE fuel before fluorination of
an actual MSRE sample was attempted.

199

Initial recoveries were low due to an apparent
loss of the high-density UF  between the inner
wall of the fluorination pot and the liner which
contains the sample. The apparatus was modified
by the reduction in diameter of the pot and the
addition of an inert-gas flush line with an inlet
at the bottom of the pot. Since recoveries were
now better than 97%, a series of MSRE samples
were fluorinated in order to recover and purify the
uranium forisotopic examination. Although the
original samples read between 500 and 600 rems,
the collection traps seldom exceeded 20 millirems
after fluorination, and were removed safely from
the hot cell for the uranium analysis.

In order to further increase the accuracy and
precision of the method, provision was made to
flush fluorine also through the inlet at the bottom
of the pot. Several hot MSRE samples have since
been analyzed. Results are encouraging in that
the uranium values for these samples agree within
0.2% with values for similar samples which were
analyzed remotely. The precision of the analysis
of replicates of the fluorinated samples is better
than 0.2%. Known amounts of uranium will be
added to barren salt samples to further evaluate
the method.
Part 4. Molten-Salt Irradiation Experiments

E. G. Bohlmann

Budgetary limitations have necessitated suspen-
sion of the ORR convection loop program during
fiscal year 1969 as such, so no further development
of the third loop has occurred. However, some
peripheral investigations have been carried out
during this period.

Investigations of the wetting of graphite by salt
prompted by the observation that salt had wetted
the graphite in the second ORR loop were con-
tinued. The results suggest that this wetting oc-
curred during the multiple sample-withdrawal drain
operation, since wetting was shown to be promoted
at points of three-phase contact of salt, graphite,
and gas at substantially lower moisture levels than
was the case for the ORR loop, and wetting does
not occur when the graphite is totally immersed.

A second capsule irradiation of fluoroborate

coolant salt in spent HFIR fuel elements was com-
pleted. No stability or compatibility problems were
observed after 1460 hr exposure under conditions of
temperature and gamma radiation intensity approxi-
mating those in an MSBR heat exchanger. Con-
siderations of the effects of delayed-neutron flu-
ences indicate that consequent fluorine generation
will be tolerably low.

A removable section of the MSRE off-gas line
located 2 ft downstream from the pump bowl was
examined as part of the continuing effort to estab-
lish the fates of fission products in molten-salt re-
actors. The results confirmed other studies which
have shown unexpectedly large amounts of noble
metals in the off-gas, but they did not reveal any
macro deposits of such isotopes.

15.1 STUDIES OF SURFACE WETTING

The susceptibility of molten salts to traces of
moisture in cover gas was studied by Kreyger,
Kirslis, and Blankenship,! who associated wetting
of graphite by salt with three-phase contact of gas,
graphite, and salt at moisture levels in the gas as
low as 10 ppm or lower. We observed wetting of

not wet it under high vacuum, but the admission of
low pressures (<1 mm) of helium (<4 ppm HZO) re-
sulted in prompt initiation of wetting.

Similar problems due to low levels of moisture or
other contaminants in gas could arise in molten-salt
reactors, in reprocessing experiments, and in other
situations involving molten salts containing lithium
and beryllium fluorides. The studies reported be-
low have been conducted in an effort to find experi-
mental operating conditions and procedures in
which interaction of salt with trace moisture in
cover gas does not occur and wetting does not en-
sue.

We tested the tendency of graphite to be wetted if
entirely immersed in salt. Two squares of graphite
were connected in ‘‘T?’ arrangement and fixed in an
inverted position in a clean copper dish. The dish
was filled with LiZBeF4 salt which was melted
under vacuum in a glove box, so that the horizontal
piece of graphite was covered with molten salt
without exposure to gas. Helium was then admitted
and the system maintained molten. After one day
the copper was wet by salt, and after one more day
salt began to creep up the exposed part of the ver-
tical graphite piece. The salt crept outside the
cup. The graphite pieces were lifted from the salt
and the salt was frozen, Microscopic examination
of the graphite showed that all areas in contact
with gas had been wet and covered with a film of
salt, but no evidence of wetting was found on any
region of the immersed graphite.

Similar behavior was apparent in droplet experi-
ments reported below. When a droplet for various
reasons moved away from its original location, it
was observed that the graphite surface initially
covered by the molten salt was not wetted. Only
subsequently would the salt interface creep over
this area.

These experiments indicate that in molten-salt
reactors, graphite should not be wetted by salt
while it is immersed, but is very susceptible to
wetting during draining and filling operations. The
observed importance of the three-phase contact area
suggests that moisture-promoted wetting is lateral
only and should not proceed inward from a graphite
surface, since salt which has covered the surface
will prevent moisture-containing gas from getting to
a deeper contact area and furthering the penetra-
tion. It seems likely that wetting of the graphite in
the ORR loop occurred during the multiple sample-
withdrawal drain operation in which tank argon (™4
ppm HQO) was used to move the salt in the equip-
ment at intervals.

A qualitative indication of the rate of moisture
absorption by salt from such gas was given by an
experiment in which helium containing ~4 ppm H20
was passed through three bubblers in series, each
containing 30 g of molten Li_BeF , salt. Flow was
continued for ten days at about 100 cc/min, suffi-
cient to increase the oxygen content of one bubbler
by 140 ppm if all the moisture were absorbed in it.

The oxygen contents of the salt from the respec-
tive bubblers were found to be in the range 60 to 65
ppm (original salt was 42 ppm), indicating that
about 15% of the inlet oxygen was taken up in each
bubbler. Simple nonconvective diffusion to a rap-
idly absorbing wall should almost completely de-
plete the moisture in any bubble of reasonable size
under experimental conditions [i.e., for 99% re-
moval, (bubble radius)?/contact time = D/0.4, or
approximately 7 cm?/sec]. Consequently, the wall
did not absorb rapidly, and the reaction rate is in-
dicated to have been limited by liquid film or sur-
face reaction rate factors rather than by gas film
resistance.

The incomplete but definite nature of moisture
removal in this experiment was substantiated by ob-
served wetting times of molten-salt droplets on
graphite planchets in heated quartz tubes immedi-
ately before and after the bubblers; upstream wet-
ting time was 7 hr, while in the downstream tube
wetting occurred overnight.

In order to study the sensitivity of the wetting be-
havior to moisture removal and to seek means of
obtaining adequately purified atmospheres in which
wetting would not occur, several techniques were
used.

Conventional techniques were tested first using a
vacuum glove box. Heated traps filled with sponge
titanium, preconditioned molecular sieves at room
temperature, and liquid-nitrogen traps containing
molecular sieves or activated charcoal were used
to further treat high-purity helium to develop a
glove-box atmosphere in which wetting did not oc-
cur. These techniques, including long-term flush-
ing and recirculation, did not inhibit the wetting,
probably because gloves, large metal surfaces, and
other factors provide a countervailing source of
moisture. This was exemplified by an experiment
in which a copper dish containing 50 g of Li BeF,
was heated in the box while helium was recircu-
lated through a molecular sieve trap and a trap con-
taining heated titanium sponge. A moisture meter
in the circuit showed 4 ppm H_O. However, in 24
hr salt had crept out of the dish sufficiently to
short the furnace leads below. The salt was found
to contain 376 ppm oxygen (original salt, 42 ppm),
an order of magnitude more water being absorbed
than indicated by the moisture meter to be in the
gas. This indicated an appreciable source of mois-
ture in the box, reacting rapidly enough to compete
successfully with the 3-hr recirculation turnover.

In order to eliminate these effects, we then used
a heated quartz tube containing a graphite planchet
with a drop of molten LizBeF4 on it, Stainless
steel connecting tubing was used.

Subsequently, in a first test in this system, salt
remained molten and nonwetting for 24 hr under
vacuum; but when cylinder helium (~4 ppm H,0)
was admitted, wetting began within a quarter hour.
When the salt was melted directly under helium,
wetting began after a quarter hour.

We installed a second heated quartz tube con-
taining titanium sponge upstream of the first in an
effort to establish nonwetting conditions under
flow. After melting under vacuum, flow was
started; the salt rapidly became covered with a
milky film. The experiment was repeated with new
materials, and a film developed on the salt within
20 hr, This suggested that system surfaces in be-
tween could be contributing moisture.

Titanium sponge was then placed also in the

quartz tube containing the molten-salt droplet be-
tween the gas inlet and the graphite planchet.
After melting the salt, helium flow was started at
10 cc/min. The salt remained in unimpaired con-
dition for a week. Flow was increased to 500
cc/min, then lowered to 100 cc/min, and the up-
stream trap cooled. The salt remained clear and
nonwetting for a day.

Thus it was demonstrated that wetting of graphite
by salt can be prevented by stringent treatment of
the cover gas. The precautions and Iength of pre-
treatment periods required to develop nonwetting
conditions indicate that even the low levels of
moisture that can be desorbed from tubing walls is
sufficient to promote wetting.

In the above experiment, flow was continued after
cooling the titanium sponge. After two days of
flow, during which time enough moisture entered to
cover the estimated titanium surface only a few
times, wetting of the graphite by the droplet was
observed. This confirmed that the protective action
was associated with heated titanium sponge and
also indicated that the activity of cold titanium
sponge was probably limited because the active
surface was not renewed and became saturated.
16. Gamma Irradiation of Fluoroborate

E. L. Compere

The proposed use in molten-salt breeder reactors
of coolant salt mixtures based on fluoroborates
could be questioned if significant decomposition of

the salt occurred as a result of exposure to delayed

neutrons and gamma radiation from the fuel salt
circulated through the heat exchanger. Neutrons
would cause a ' %B(n,a) reaction, yielding from
NaBF, an alpha particle, "LiF, NaF, and F, (or
excess free F atoms). The high-energy alpha and
"Li fragments (2.4+ Mev) could decompose other
fluoroborate ions, presumably yielding in such a
case elemental boron and fluorine and fluoride
ion. Intense gamma radiation could have a similar
effect. The (n,a) reaction is calculable and ap-
pears to be trivial. The high-energy fragment de-
composition of molten fluoroborate is not known
explicitly, nor is the gamma effect. Since these
would be expected to have similar results, the
gamma effect has been evaluated first in order to
permit discrimination if required.

An experimental rig to expose molten fluoroborate
salt to intense gamma radiation was described pre-
viously.! An argon-filled aluminum container with
a heated capsule containing the salt was placed
in the center hole of a freshly spent fuel element
from the High Flux Isotope Reactor in the reactor
pool.

The first fluoroborate irradiation assembly, re-
ported earlier,’ was exposed at 600°C for 533 hr,
accumulating a dose of 2 x 10!'° r, The tempera-
ture profile in the capsule appeared to have been
uneven, attributed to some water collected in the
containment. Operation and results of the second
fluoroborate irradiation experiment are given below.

16.1 GAMMA DOSE RATES AND DECAY
OF SPENT FUEL ELEMENTS

The gamma dose rate to these experiments fell
as the element decayed, in accord with estimates
based on the Way-Wigner or Untermyer-Weills equa-
tions. The HFIR elements were generally run at
100 Mw for 23 days. We inserted our experimental
assembly into the center hole of the spent element
after a cooling period after shutdown of from about
1 to 4 days, removing it only to insert it into the
next freshly spent element.

The gamma flux was determined by the reduction
of 0.02 M Ce(SO,), solutions exposed in the center
hole before and after the exposure of the experi-
mental rig, and was determined during exposure by
observing the added electrical heat (per unit of
heated system mass) required to maintain constant
temperature (to be compared with the requirement
in the absence of gamma radiation). Results are
shown in Fig. 16.1, where electric heat require-
ment is plotted against a time scale based on de-
cay heat as a fraction of operation power, com-
puted using the Way-Wigner equation. Electric
heat requirement was extrapolated to zero decay
heat, and gamma heat was measured from this as
the origin. Using the definition that 100 ergs/g =
1 rad, the dose rate was calculated. Thus the
radiation intensity varied between 140 x 10° r/hr
(0.4 w/g) for an element cooled 1.5 days to 17 x
10° t/hr (0.05 w/g) after 31.8 days of cooling.
Values obtained by ceric sulfate dosimetry, also
shown, scattered more but were in agreement.

ments 19 and 11. Irradiation was terminated on
May 14, 1968, after 1460 hr at 600°C, accumulating
an estimated dose of 7.7 x 101° r (average rate,
5.3 x 107 t/hr or 0.15 w/g).

Prior to exposure the 32 g of NaBF -NaF eutectic
mixture (92-8 mole %) was melted in the Hastelloy N
capsule under argon, and the capsule was sealed
under argon. The capsule was then vacuum pumped
at 150°C, valved off under vacuum, and heated to
600°C. The observed pressure of ~ 142 mm Hg is
as anticipated from Cantor’s data.? Upon cooling

to 25°C, the residual pressure was below the limit
of detection of the gage (<5 mm Hg), and analysis
of this residual gas showed it to be largely hydro-
gen (H2, 96.7%; H20, 0.9%,; 02, 0.2%; N, + CoO,
1.9%; CO,, 0.2%; Ar, 0.1%).

During irradiation, which was uneventful except
for a plugging problem discussed below, an argon
atmosphere was maintained in the container around
the capsule; in contrast to the first experiment, no
evidence of water in the container was found.

After 13 days of operation, the 50-mil-ID tubing,
which connected the gas space above the salt to a
pressure transducer, plugged suddenly when the
salt temperature was increased rapidly from 350°C
205

to 600°C following a short power interruption to
the capsule heater. The tube was opened by
heating the capsule slowly to ~650°C (BF3 pres-
sure, ~ % atm). The capillary tube remained open
until it plugged a second time after 26 days of op-
eration. This plug occurred when the salt tem-
perature was decreased from 600°C to 370°C when
power to the electric heater was interrupted. At-
tempts to open the tube by heating the capsule to
~690°C (BF, pressure, ~1 atm) were unsuccess-
ful, and irradiation was continued at 600°C.

Near the end of the irradiation period, argon gas
(300 mm Hg pressure) was added to the pressure
tube in an attempt to relieve the plug so that the
residual gas in the capsule could be removed for
analysis. When the capsule assembly (with pres-
sure tube and transducer intact) was removed from
the fuel element and transferred to Y-12, the pres-
sure had decreased from 300 mm to 105 mm, indi-
cating some leakage of argon into the capsule
past the plug in the tube. Mass spectrographic
analysis of the gas (argon plus residual) removed
from the capsule showed 96.8% Ar, 2.4% H2, 0.7%
N2 + CO, and 0.1% 02. No BF, or F2 was found.

The capsule was opened and the following ob-
servations were made:

1. The surface of the metal walls and enclosed
Hastelloy N specimen showed no evident at-
tack, but were dulled. Weight loss of the 29-
cm? specimen was negligible (0.0007 g).

2. The salt consisted of rather large clear plates
with translucent, somewhat smoky, crystalline
solid between the plates (light gray at a dis-
tance).

3. A small amount of blackish scum was found on
the salt surface; this presumably was a salt
impurity, as it was also observed in the absence
of radiation.

4. A ““droplet’ of solidified salt covered the
opening of the 50-mil-ID tube in the top of the
capsule. Blockage extended about 3 in. from
the capsule.

5. Particles of salt shaped as half-sphere frozen
droplets which presumably had adhered to the
metal walls were found in the gas region above
the salt body.

The droplets found in the gas regions are attrib-
uted to spray developing as the system ‘‘boiled”’
under vacuum during heatup. We heated the salt
similarly in a quartz tube and observed boiling and
spray. The increasing gas pressure is believed to

have forced some droplets into the capillary, ulti-
mately resulting in the observed plugging.

None of the findings were indicative of any ra-
diation decomposition of fluoroborate. It is con-
sequently concluded that no incompatibility be-
tween the fluoroborate salt and Hastelloy N was
caused by gamma irradiation to a dose of 7.7 x
1010 r with an average intensity of 0.15 w/g and
a maximum intensity of 0.5 w/g. For comparison,
the average intensity of absorbed gamma radiation
estimated for the MSBR heat exchangers is ~0.25
w/g, and for the MSRE it is ~0.02 w/g.

16.3 ESTIMATED NEUTRON EFFECTS

An open and document literature search revealed
no studies of radiation or neutron effects on fluorobo-
rate salts. A study® on BF, (gas) appears rele-
vant. MTR exposure of four capsules containing
BF, to various integrated thermal neutron fluences
up to 8 x 1012 nvt resulted in decomposition of up
to about 50% of the BF ,, with about twice as many
molecules of BF, being decomposed as there were
helium atoms produced. Indicated reactions were:

1°BF3+n-—%7LiF+a+F2 ,

BF3+<1—9B 1+3/2F2+He.

meta
This amounted to about 2’ molecules of F
being produced per boron fission (2.4+ Mev), or
about 11/2 molecules of F by the fission-fragment
action. The resulting apparent G value is 0.6 x
10~% molecule of F_ per 100 ev for the high-energy
alpha and 7Li particles. The low value is indica-
tive of vigorous recombination of any BF_ frag-
ments. Since in the liquid system, with a sym-
metrical BF,~ ion capable of exchanging with
fluorine atoms and ions, even more vigorous re-
combination should occur, enhanced by the high
melt temperature, the direct (n,a) reaction would
appear to be the major process in the molten-salt
system. If about 15 x 101 ° delayed neutrons per
second should be released in an MSBR heat ex-
changer, the maximum fluorine yield (15 x 10!°
molecules of F per second) would amount to 8
moles (0.3 kg) of F per year — most likely an
acceptably low value.

products other than Kr-Xe (and their daughters),
in particular noble metals, may be carried into
the MSRE off-gas system. If such behavior could
be demonstrated, a useful means of removal and
recovery of some of these substances could be de-
veloped. In any event, the understanding of fission
product behavior in molten-salt systems would be
increased. Examination of material deposited in
the off-gas system would be the most direct ap-
proach.

After the shutdown of MSRE run 14 on March 25,
1968, a section of off-gas line, the jumper section
of line 522, was removed for examination. This
line, a 3-ft length of ¥ -in.-ID open convolution
flexible hose fabricated of type 304 stainless
steel with O-ringed flanges on each end, is lo-
cated about 2 ft downstream from the pump bowl.
The upstream flange is a side-entering flange
which attaches to the vertical line leaving the
pump bowl, while the downstream flange is a top-
entering flange which attaches to the widened
holdup line. The jumper discussed here, the third
used in the MSRE, was installed prior to run 10,
which began in December 1966,

After the MSRE shutdown on March 25, 1968,
the jumper section was removed on April 4 and
transferred to the High-Radiation-Level Exami-
nation Laboratory for cutup and examination.

Two flexible shaft tools used to probe the line
leading to the pump bowl were also obtained for
examination. On opening the container an ap-
preciable rise in hot-cell off-gas activity was

noted, most of it passing the cell filters and

being retained by the building charcoal trap. As
the jumper section was removed from the container
and placed on fresh blotter paper, some dust fell
from the upstream flange. This dust was recovered,
and a possibly larger amount was obtained from the
flange face using a camel’s hair brush. The powder
looked like soot; it fell but drifted somewhat in the
moving air of the cell, as if it were a heavy dust.
An ~ 8-mg sample read about 80 r/hr at ‘‘contact.”
The downstream flange was tapped and brushed
over a sheet of paper, and similar quantities of
black powder were obtained from it. An ~15-mg
sample read about 200 r/hr at contact. Chemical
and radiochemical analyses of these dust samples
are given later.

The flanges each appeared to have remaining on
them a smooth, dull-black film but no other deposits
of significance. Some unidentified bright flecks
were seen in or on the surface of the upstream
flange. Where the black film was gently scratched,
bright metal showed through.

Short sections of the jumper-line hose were taken
from each end, examined microscopically, and sub-
mitted for chemical and radiochemical analysis.
Except for rather thin, dull-black films which
smoothly covered all surfaces including the con-
volutions, no deposits, attack, or other effects
were seen.

Each of the flexible probe tools was observed
to be covered with blackish, pasty, granular ma-
terial. This material was identified by x ray as
fuel salt particles. Chemical and radiochemical
analyses of the tools will be presented later.

Electron microscope photographs taken of the
upstream dust showed relatively solid particles of

129Te, and 311 (Te daughter). These analyses
were obtained on samples of dust from upstream
and downstream flanges, on the ~1-in. sections
of flexible hose cut near the flanges, and on the
first flexible shaft tool used to probe the pump
off-gas exit line.

The data thus obtained are best discussed after
reduction to a suitable common basis. This can
be done between samples of the same kind by con-
sidering equal amounts of sample and between
isotopes in a sample by comparing with expected
amounts such as MSRE inventory. Direct com-
parison between samples of different types re-
quires establishment of a relationship between the
types, which has not been done; however, relative
comparisons might be made. The MSRE inventory
decay rate of each isotope (referred to run 14 shut-

down) was computed from the detailed power history

of the reactor (8.0 Mw full power) by summation
of power-weighted saturation factors for each
period. Inventory decay rates were also calcu-
lated for daughters of rare gases, based on the
amount of the short-lived rare gas that could be
stripped from the circulating fuel salt into the
pump bow! gas space. The first-approximation
model used for this purpose assumes that the
rare gas which enters the pump bowl, either dis-
solved in salt or in entrained bubbles, is entirely
stripped into the purge gas stream, and effectively
none of it is returned to the main circulating
stream 1n any reentrained bubbles. More complex
assumptions regarding mass transfer character-
istics to bubbles and their entrainment and strip-
ping are not attempted here. Both types of in-
ventory values, and the ratio of isotope activity
in the various samples to the inventory values,
are shown in Table 17.2.

On such an inventory basis the salt constituents
can also be included in the comparison, as can
carbon, if a lubricating oil leak rate (such as a re-
ported value of 1.58 liters in 5% months) is as-
sumed to persist for the full period of operation.
These data are thus presented in terms of MSRE
inventory in Table 17.2. Similar behavior of the
various kinds of constituents should yield equal
values for all data for a given kind of sample.
Table 17.2 is discussed below from this point of
view.

Proportions of Li, Be, and U agreed within each
sample within a factor of 2, with Li always high.
Zirconium varied between agreement and values
of about 1/6 of the others. Thus to a fair approxi-

mation the fuel ingredients appear to have been
transported as particles, presumably droplets of
spray. Uranium does not appear in any sample to
have been carried over by any mechanism more
than other constituents. For the flexible tool
the relatively higher values of lithium and beryl-
lium may indicate pickup of some residual LiF -
BeF2 flush salt, which had entered this line as
overflow in 1966, just prior to the installation of
the present jumper.

When the activity of each fission product isotope
is expressed as a fraction of MSRE inventory, the
isotopes can be placed in several groups as shown
in Table 17.2. ‘‘Noble metals,’” including 111Ag,
99Mo, 196Ru, 132Te, 129Te, and 1311 (Te daugh-
ter), appeared to be present 100-fold to 3000-fold
the amount of salt present and roughly in agree-
ment with the carbon. Similarly, the Xe-Kr daugh-
ters were present in as high or higher quantities
dependent on the particular Xe or Kr half-life in-
volved. These included 89Sr, 90Sr, 91y, 137Cg,
and 14%Ba,

Elements with very stable fluorides, °5Zr,
147Nd, 141Ce, and !**Ce, were present in very
low amounts never exceeding the salt equivalent.

Niobium-95 was present in relative amounts at
least fortyfold the °5Zr, and two- to tenfold the
salt ingredients.

17.3 DISCUSSION

The following comments appear justified:

1. No deposits other than the black film and car-
bonaceous dust were noted. These are likely
to have resulted from lubricating oil decompo-
sition.

2. Small particles of salt a few microns in size
were noted. These were doubtless salt spray.

3. The salt appeared to be regular fuel salt, per-
haps a bit high in lithium and beryllium and
somewhat low in zirconium.

4. There was no uranium transfer by any mecha-
nism other than salt spray.

5. Deposition of soot over all areas is not sur-
prising. With a mean residence time of 6 min
in a gas space at 600 to 700°C, with beta de-
cay energy of the order of 100 w/liter, sub-
stantial pyrolysis-radiolysis of lubricating
oil leaking into the pump bowl should result
in tars and coked soot. Some soot appeared

due to a ““cool-wall’’ effect.?

High levels of noble metal and rare-gas daugh-
ter fission products were associated with and
doubtless adsorbed by the carbonaceous soot.

ceed the salt, indicating transport separate

not greatly below the relative yields of the
daughters of the rare-gas fission products.
This is compatible with the hypothesis! of
aerosols of these elements, and with a portion
of these elements depositing on internal sur-
faces. Tellurium, and iodine, regarded as a
tellurium daughter, could be included in this
category.

The relative amount of °>Nb in dust samples
appears to be significantly higher than that of
salt, and higher than its parent °5Zr. However,
it is considerably lower than the levels for
‘“‘noble’’ metals; niobium may be transferred by
a different mechanism.
Part 5. Materials Development

H. E. McCoy

Our program continues to emphasize the two
primary structural materials in molten-salt re-
actors — graphite and Hastelloy N. Our experience
with the MSRE demonstrates very clearly the basic

compatibility of these materials with fluoride salts.

Although advanced MSBR’s will utilize these same
two materials, we feel that some improvements are
needed. We are studying irradiation damage in
graphite to learn the controlling factors, with a
future objective of developing graphites that will
withstand higher neutron fluences. This has re-
quired that we become knowledgeable of the raw
materials and fabrication techniques used in mak-
ing graphites and that we develop the capabilities
for making a variety of tests to evaluate the final
product. Many of these tests are routine, but we
find that new techniques must be established in

many areas to give us the information that we need.

Our irradiation testing in the HFIR is an integral
part of this program. It is quite likely that we
shall need graphite with a low surface diffusivity
for fission products, particularly *3°Xe. The tar-
get diffusivity of <10~% cm?/sec is best obtained

by surface sealing with pyrolytic carbon. To keep
this material from spalling during irradiation, we
are sealing under conditions that will cause the
pyrolytic carbon to penetrate the graphite substrate.

The primary fault with the type of Hastelloy N
used in the MSRE is that its strength and ductility
are reduced by irradiation. We have demonstrated
that a slight modification of the chemical composi-
tion improves the resistance of this alloy to neutron
damage. We are working on the scaleup of this
alloy and are confronted with some problems that
are not at all foreign to nickel-base alloys. Two
such problems, a high-temperature metallurgical
instability and poor weldability, are under study.

Our corrosion program is concerned primarily with
the compatibility of Hastelloy N with the proposed
fluoroborate coolant salt. Work is also in progress
to determine the compatibility of the titanium-
modified Hastelloy N with fluoride salts. Our
corrosion program is also being expanded to in-
clude the compatibility of salts and bismuth with
potential structural materials for the chemical
processing plant.

18.1.1 Examinations of Specimens Removed

The core surveillance specimens were received
at the Hot-Cell facilities on April 3, 1968. The
salt had drained cleanly from the container basket
and specimens, and the assembly of metal and
graphite specimens appeared to be in excellent
physical condition (Fig. 18.1). Disassembly and
reassembly of this complex rig of three stringers
of graphite and Hastelloy N (ref. 1) were routine.

213

Disassembly was expedited to provide the Reactor
Chemistry Division with specimens for fission
product studies as quickly as possible.

The two stringers we removed, RS3 and RR2,
had been in the reactor for different times and had
accumulated fast fluences of 4.8 x 102° and 8.5 x

Table 18.1). They included several s pecial types
of graphite in addition to the MSRE-grade CGB
graphite to obtain more detailed information on the
behavior of the fission products. These were
pitch-impregnated grade CGB, pyrolytic graphite,
and isotropic graphite, grade AXF-5QBG. The
results of the fission product studies on these
materials are given in Part 3 of this report.

As usual, the exposure had dulled the bright sur-

214

faces of the Hastelloy N. The mechanical properties

of these samples are reported in Sect. 18.2. The
graphite specimens appeared unaltered in diffused
lighting. However, under special high-angle light-
ing, there was a very thin film of material visible
that was more clearly seen on the graphite having
the longest exposure. The appearance of this film
on the graphite in stringer RR2 is shown in Fig.
18.2; it is nearly invisible on stringer RS3. The
films were on the surfaces of the graphite that
were exposed to the laminarly flowing fuel salt
along the full vertical length of the surveillance
specimens assembly. Where pieces of graphite
were in intimate contact and the flow of salt was
restricted, films were not visible. Note in Fig.

18.2 that the graphite surfaces appear clean and
normal where there may have been some turbulence
in the flowing salt; also, the films were easily
scratched. The films are so thin that we have not
been able to identify them.

The vessel surveillance specimens of two rods
of Hastelloy N tensile specimens, X2, had a dark
gray-green appearance that is normal for Hastelloy
N exposed in the N, —approximately 2% O, atmos-
phere outside the core vessel wall. The mechani-
cal properties of these are reported in Sect. 18.2.

18.1.2 New Specimens in the Surveillance
Assembly

Two new stringers, RS4 and RR3, of graphite
and modified Hastelloy N for the core and one
modified Hastelloy stringer (two rods of tensile
specimens), X3, replaced those removed (see
Table 18.1). The graphite specimens continued
to be predominantly grade CGB for the continued
monitoring and study of the MSRE core graphite.

pitch impregnated, carbonized, and graphitized at
3000°C were included to determine if the addi-
tional impregnation will help prevent the penetra-
tion of fission products into the graphite.

The single-fluid concept of the MSRE relaxes,
but does not eliminate, the potential need for
graphite-to-metal and graphite-to-graphite joints.
We have included a molybdenum—Hastelloy N
joint brazed with Pd—35% Ni—5% Cr to study its
compatibility with the MSRE environment.

The flux monitor section has been simplified to
eliminate the solid-phase bonding of the flux

monitors to their protective sheath of Hastelloy N.

The three flux monitor wires of iron, nickel, and
type 302 stainless steel have been replaced
with a single flux monitor wire of type 302
stainless steel that is separated from the
sheath by high-purity alumina (greater than

99% Al,0,).

A new feature of the two new core stringers is
the placement of a 0.004-in.-thick foil of Hastel-
loy N at some of the strap positions, as shown in
Fig. 18.3. This type of specimen was requested
by the Reactor Chemistry Division to allow the
use of more convenient and accurate techniques

215

for determining the fission product deposition on
the Hastelloy N.

Figure 18.4 shows some fabrication modifica-
tions that have been made to allow flowing salt
on all four sides of the graphite rather than on
only three. A comparison of the fission products
deposited on different sides of these samples
should give qualitative information of how flow
rate affects fission product deposition. Our
graphite specimens are routinely machined with
surface finishes of less than 32 pin. (rms). We
have included some identical graphite samples with
the 32-u in. surface and with polished surfaces (Fig.
18.4). The polished surfaces may enable a better
delineation of the fission product distribution,
since in most cases 90 to 95% of each nuclide was
found in the first 10 mils from the graphite sur-
faces.?

The complete reassembly, including sealing the
sttingers in the used perforated Hastelloy N
basket, was completed on April 10, seven days
after receipt.

18.2 MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF MSRE
SURVEILLANCE SPECIMENS

H. E. McCoy, Jr.

We have reported previously the properties of
two groups of Hastelloy N surveillance samples
removed from the MSRE .3'4 The properties of the
third group of specimens, removed on April 3,
1968, give further information on the behavior of
Hastelloy N after long periods of exposure to a
neutron flux, salt, and N, plus 2 to 5% O, environ-
ments. Rods of standard Hastelloy N were re-
moved from the core and the vessel surveillance
facilities for examination. The details of the ex-
posure conditions are given in Table 18.2. The
rods positioned outside the vessel closely reflect

the properties of the vessel after 72,441 Mwhr of
operation. The only Hastelloy N parts that have
had an exposure comparable with that of the rods
removed from the core (thermal fluence = 9.4 x
1020 neutrons/cm?) are the control rod thimbles,
which are under a slightly compressive stress and
can be replaced relatively easily. The vessel
would only reach a thermal-neutron exposure of
this magnitude after 40 years of operation; so the
results on these specimens are of interest primarily
for future reactors.

The excellent compatibility of Hastelloy N with

as a result of the long nuclear and thermal ex-
posures and have no relation to the environment.

We ran a wide spectrum of tests on these ma-
terials, but shall present only the results of
particular concern to the MSRE. We have shown
that this alloy is subject to a type of high-tem-
perature radiation damage which reduces the
creep-tupture strength and the strain at fracture;
this is due to the helium produced by the thermal
19B(n,a) transmutation.’~7 A second potential
ptoblem that has been pointed out by our surveil-
lance program is that the fracture strain at ambient
temperature (25°C) continues to decrease with
exposure.®* Thus, our program is directed
strongly at measuring the changes in the properties
of our Hastelloy N surveillance specimens at 25
and 650°C.

The creep-rupture properties of all the surveil-
lance specimens of heats 5065 and 5085 that we
have tested are shown in Fig. 18.7. Generally,
the time to rupture at a given stress level is
shorter, the higher the fluence; however, there is
a drastic reduction in rupture life as the fluence
increases from 1.3 to 9.4 x 102° neutrons/cm?.
This correlates reasonably well with the quantity

of 198 converted to helium; 20% is transmuted at

a thermal fluence of 1.3 x 1029 neutrons/cm?,

and about 85% is transmuted at 9.4 x 102° neutrons/
cm?. The variation in rupture life due to different
fluences is greater, the higher the stress level.

The creep properties do not show any detectable
dependence on the time at 650°C, indicating that
the alloy is metallurgically stable at the operat-
ing temperature of the MSRE.

The strain at fracture measured in both creep-
rupture and tensile tests at 650°C is shown in
Fig. 18.8, The scatter band is for the same heats
of material irradiated in the ORR. The fracture
strain at high strain rates (e.g., 12 and 300%/hr)
is very dependent on the thermal fluence, but most
creep specimens with a thermal fluence of =1.3 x
1029 neutrons/cm? fractured at 1 to 2.5% strain,
regardless of strain rate. The surveillance samples
seem to be immune to the ductility minimum as a
function of fracture strain established for the same
materials when irradiated for shorter times (~ 1000
hr) in the ORR.? The samples irradiated to 9.4 x
1029 neutrons/cm? exhibit extremely low fracture
strains under creep conditions.

Our experience with the ductility reduction at
25°C is summarized in Table 18.3. In thistem-
perature range the fracture strain is not very
sensitive to strain rate; so we feel that the ten-

sile tests at a strain rate of 0.05 min—?! are ade-
quate. A careful analysis of the data indicates
that the magnitude of the ductility reduction is
dependent upon time and fluence. It is not clear

whether thermal or fast fluence is the most im-
portant, since both change simultaneously. Our
metallographic observations of carbide precipitates
(Figs. 18.5 and 18.6) and the observation that the
ductility can be restored by a postirradiation anneal
of 8 hr at 871°C (Table 18.3) indicate that the
reduction in fracture strain is likely due to carbide
precipitation. This precipitation is controlled

largely by thermal annealing (indicated by the
control samples in Table 18.3), and the neutron
irradiation enhances the process. To date the
lowest fracture strain observed is 28.9%, a very
acceptable value for operation.

Two heats of modified Hastelloy N were removed

of both alloys is shown in Fig. 18.9. The most
significant feature is the lack of corrosion. A

thin surface layer is present on both materials

that looks more like a deposit than corrosive attack.
This portion of the sample may have been in con-
tact with graphite, and the coating may be a carbide
layer. Moderate grain-boundary precipitation has
occurred in the alloy. The postirradiation properties
of these materials are better than those of standard
Hastelloy N. The improvement is illustrated by the
creep-rupture results in Fig. 18.10. The rupture
life is improved markedly, but the most significant
improvement is in the fracture strain. We are con-
tinuing the development of these alloy systems.
19. Graphite Studies

19.1 PROCUREMENT OF GRAPHITE

W. H. Cook

We have continued the procurement of special
grades of graphite for MSBR’s for (1) the determina-
tion of the physical and mechanical properties be-
fore and after irradiation, (2) sealing research with
pyrolytic carbon, (3) graphite-to-metal joining
studies, and (4) fabrication of test assemblies.

The grades and disposition of graphite obtained
recently are summarized in Table 19.1.

Grade H337 graphite is a high-quality experi-
mental raw-coke-base graphite and is of extreme
interest in our irradiation-damage studies. It was
purchased in relatively large sizes and quantities

for use in building engineering experiments. Sev-
eral pipes of the H337 graphite are shown in
Fig. 19.1. There are no detectable cracks in this
material, and the physical and mechanical proper-
ties look reasonably attractive. Grade JOZ is the
base stock for grades H337 and H364. The latter
was laboratory processed and should be essen-
tially the same as grade H337. Grade H364 has
shown relatively good stability under preliminary
neutron irradiation to a fluence of 1.3 x 10%% neu-
trons/cm? (see Sect. 19.7). A comparison of the
behavior of JOZ and H337 should give some indi-
cation of the effects of heavy impregnation on the
stabilities of graphite under irradiation.

Our current procurement program involves com-
mercial vendors and the Chemical Engineering

general status and goals of the program to date
are summarized in Table 19.2. The anisotropic
materials are used primarily for comparison with
data obtained in other irradiation facilities. The
terms mechanical, mechanical-chemical, and
chemical refer to the techniques used to obtain
isotropic bodies. The mechanical technique ob-
tains isotropy by randomizing the orientation of
anisotropic or near-isotropic filler materials. The
classical pelletizing step in forming a body is an
example of this. The chemical heading refers to
graphite filler material that is isotropic as a re-
sult of an inherent or applied chemical reaction(s)
that forms isotropic graphite. The types we cur-
rently have under consideration are shown in
Table 19.2.

Work has started in the Chemical Engineering
Development Department of Y-12 (CEDP of Y-12)
to make reconstituted graphite. This technique

enables one to utilize standard fabrication tech-
niques, such as extrusion, to fabricate isotropic
bodies from small pieces of specially produced
isotropic graphite. The graphite is crushed, ground,
and sized to make isotropic filler material, which
is blended with a suitable binder and fabricated
with standard processes. Isotropic grades AXF!
and 20332 have been fabricated this way. The pre-
liminary data indicate that the extruded bodies
have properties equal to those of the special
starting materials. This may mean that superior
isotropic grades of graphite that are fabricated in
relatively small dimensions may be utilized in
standard fabrication techniques to form large-sized
shapes that have essentially the same properties
as the small, superior starting materials.

19.2 PHYSICAL PROPERTY MEASUREMENTS

W. H. Cook J. L. Griffith
0. B. Cavin

We run a set of very cursory property tests on
new graphites to determine whether they are poten-
tially useful for use in MSBR’s or whether they can
contribute to our understanding of irradiation dam-
age in graphite. Those that are of interest are
tested more thoroughly. Our basic requirements
are that the material be isotropic, that it have a
density >1.85 g/cc, that the maximum pore entrance
diameter be <1 p, and that the helium gas permea-
bility be <10~2 cm ?%/sec.

Equipment already exists for many of the meas-
urements that we make, but it was necessary to

design and build a wide-range gas permeability
apparatus to measure permeabilities from 107! to
as low as <10~ '2 cm?/sec. The measurement is
based on the pressure rise method. The appa-
ratus is a welded all-metal system in which all
valves have metal poppets and seats except two
that use Viton O-rings. On the vacuum side, the
pressure rise side, pressures are measured with a
capacitance manometer for the high-permeability
measurements and are monitored with a calibrated
helium leak detector for the low-permeability
measurements. The system is designed to meas-
ure hollow cylindrical specimens, such as the
HFIR irradiation specimens, and solid disks of
graphite.

ties of several grades of graphite that we are
studying at this time. Mechanical property meas-
urements on a number of these are reported in
Sect. 19.3. The limited size and number of sam-
ples and the structural variations normally found
in graphite relegate these to being representative
rather than absolute values for these properties.
The specific resistances range from 740 to 1155
microhm-cm. We believe that this should be <900
microhm-cm for a good quality graphite, but have
little supporting evidence. The helium gas per-
meabilities range from 3.2 x 1075 to 1.0 x 101
cm?/sec. The last three grades, AXF, 9948, and
AT]-SG, had not received special treatments to
create low permeabilities. These and other data
show progress in the development of high-quality
isotropic graphite. However, the data continue to
indicate that the <10~ 8 cm?/sec permeability

sought most likely will have to be obtained by

surface sealing (see Sect. 19.5.)

19.3 BEND TESTING OF GRAPHITE

C. R. Kennedy

The mechanical properties of several types of
graphite are being studied since the properties are
very sensitive to the structure. We are performing
bend tests at room temperature and using a small
specimen because we are limited in the quantity
of material and wish to make selective samplings.
Comparative tests of samples varying in size have
been made and demonstrate that the sample size
is adequate for the finer-grained MSBR grades.
The bend specimen is 0.110 in. thick and 0.470 in.
wide and is loaded in a four-point bend apparatus
228

with 1% in. between the outer supports and % in.
between the inner supports. Although we have
confidence in these data, they should be con-
sidered only as relative values and should not be
used as engineering data without further testing to
determine size effects.

In analyzing the data, we assume that the stress-
strain behavior of graphite can be described by

€ = Ao + Bo?

; (D

where
€ = strain,
O = stress,
A = 1/E, where E = Young’s modulus,
B = constant.

We have found that Eq. (1) does fit the majority
of the data to within a few percent. The quad-
ratic equation for the stress-strain behavior re-
sults in a simple solution for the work done for
fracture, namely,

1 2
total work = /€ o+ 7,€.0;, 2)

where
€ = elastic strain at fracture = O‘f/E ,
o, = fracture stress,

€, = total strain at fracture.

Typical results of our bend tests are given in

Table 19.4. The anisotropy of the graphite is
easily observed in the fracture stress and elastic
modulus values obtained for grades 1425, AT]J-S,
and 9567. However, the work to fracture, which
is more representative of the defect structure,
appears to be isotropic. The fracture path in
graphite is primarily through the binder-rich re-
gions in the structure; thus the work to fracture
yields some measure of the binder integrity.
Since we believe that the integrity of the binder
region strongly controls the lifetime of graphite
under irradiation, the work to fracture is an im-
portant parameter in evaluating materials.

There are several factors in the fabrication of
the graphite that must be considered in interpret-
ing the results. One is the effect of impregnation,
which significantly alters and improves the mechan-
ical behavior of the material. An example of the
influence and difficulty of controlling the impregna-
tion process is seen in the results obtained for

graphites H337E, H364, and H337PL. These
three materials originate from the same base stock;
H337E was fabricated in the laboratory, H364 in
a small pilot facility, and H337PL in larger, more
commercial, equipment. The apparent inability to
easily control the impregnation processing clari-
fies why it is one of the more proprietary areas,
and very little information is obtained from the
vendors. Although some improvement has been
observed by impregnation, not all of the various
impregnants used to improve the mechanical be-
havior will retain the necessary binder integrity
under irradiation to yield an extended life.

Another factor is a duplex type of defect struc-
ture caused by multiple forming operations during
processing. This type of structure can be identi-
fied by dense low-porosity regions of coke
particle clusters bindered to one another with a
fairly large defect structure between the clusters.
The mechanical test is quite sensitive to the
large defects, and the work to fracture will be
small, as observed from the results for grades
HCTE 21 and HCTE 22. It is very probable that
these large defects will limit the life under irra-
diation; however, this type of duplex structure
will very likely have a greater life than materials
having the same size defect uniformly distributed
throughout the structure.

In general, the bend test does yield information
about the quality of the binder structure in the
graphite. However, these data must be interpreted
with regard to the fabrication procedures and re-
sulting structures. There likely will not be a
direct relation between the mechanical properties
and irradiation lifetime; however, we believe that
extended lifetime under irradiation will not be ob-
tainable from materials exhibiting a low work to
fracture.

One of the problems associated with the collec-
tion and interpretation of x-ray data on graphite is
the low absorption this material has for x rays.?
This property results in the broadening of the
diffraction maxima and an effective sample dis-
placement from the center of the x-ray diffrac-

graphites being studied in our HFIR irradiation
program. Three grades of graphite furnished by
Y-12 have been checked for anisotropy using an
integrated intensity ratio of the diffraction from
the basal planes taken from the longitudinal and
transverse directions of the material. These
materials show a high degree of preferred orienta-
tion, as shown in Table 19.6. More recent in-
formation, however, indicates that this simplified
technique is not adequate for preferred orientation
determinations because the distribution of the
basal planes is not uniform around the extrusion
direction. Nonuniform distribution of basal planes
may also be present in materials fabricated by
other techniques. A pole figure technique for
determining the distribution of planes in the
material is being investigated.

The solution to these problems, along with our
peak shape analysis, will make it possible to
more accurately determine the crystalline proper-
ties of graphite by means of x-ray diffraction.

19.5 GAS IMPREGNATION OF GRAPHITE
WITH CARBON

D. V. Kiplinger R. L. Beatty

One of the requirements for graphite to be used
in a molten-salt breeder reactor is a surface with
low permeability to prevent xenon absorption.
Calculations suggest that a helium permeability
of less than 10— 8 cm?/sec at the graphite surface
will be required to keep the xenon concentration
in the core to the desired level. It is necessary
to consider sealing the graphite surface by some
means, since commercially available fine-grained
graphites usually have permeabilities some five
or six orders of magnitude higher than this re-
quired level.

Carbon is the preferred surface sealing material
because it does not impose the parasitic neutron
absorption penalties associated with refractory
metals. Since the crystalline character of a
pyrolytic carbon deposit is likely to be different
from the base graphite, the pyrolytic carbon, if
applied simply as a surface coating, may spall
during irradiation due to different rates of neutron-
induced dimensional changes. However, if the
carbon can be deposited in the pores beneath the
surface, the sealant may stay intact during irra-
diation.

The gas-impregnation method we are studying
employs a chamber which is cycled between
vacuum and hydrocarbon atmospheres while the
graphite substrate is inductively heated to tem-
peratures of 800 to 1000°C (see Fig. 19.2). The
important variables under consideration are sub-
strate temperature, frequency of the vacuum and
hydrocarbon exposure cycles, and substrate
porosity. By using this vacuum-pressure pulsing
technique, we have sealed graphite specimens to
helium permeabilities of less than 1.3 x 10~ 1°
cm?/sec, a level which was retained even after
3000°C heat treatments.

The specimen geometry was selected to meet
the requirements of the HFIR irradiation facility
(i.e., a hollow right cylinder of nominal dimensions
0.400 in. OD, 0.125 in. ID and 0.500 in. long).
The graphites used for substrates are either Poco
grade AXF or UCC grade ATJ-SG. These two
grades were selected to provide irradiation dimen-
sional stability and to study the effects of dif-
ferent pore-size materials upon the total process-
ing times required to seal the specimens. The

AT]J-SG graphite has approximately 60% of its
pores greater than 0.8 y, while the pores of the
Poco are nearly all less than 0.8 u. The AT]J-SG
has at least a factor of 10 greater permeability
than the Poco and appears to require about twice
as long to seal as the Poco does at a given tem-
perature.

We have reduced the total process time required
to seal a specimen by studying the effects of
varying process parameters. The process is quite
sensitive to temperature, with the rate of deposi-
tion generally increasing with increasing tempera-
ture. However, high temperature favors the forma-
tion of surface coatings with little penetration
into the substrate. These factors limit the tem-
perature range of interest to 800 to 1000°C, and
we must adjust this parameter to obtain the opti-
mum combination of deposition rate and penetra-
tion for each material. We also determined that
the sealing rate increases with increasing vacuum-
pressure cycle frequency but that there is a
practical maximum above which loss of penetra-
tion results. Increasing the hydrocarbon exposure
from 1/2 sec to 1 sec slightly shortens the process
time needed for sealing. We increased the sealing
rate of the larger-pore-size AT]J-SG material by

processing it at a higher temperature than appears
optimum for the Poco graphite.

For evaluating depth of carbon impregnation, we
have developed a procedure employing subse-
quent mercury impregnation and then radiographic
examination. Disks 5 to 20 mils thick are cut
perpendicular to the axis of the carbon-impregnated
specimen and then subjected to various pressures
of mercury. At certain pressures (1000 to 5000 psi
for Poco), the mercury will penetrate only the
pores not impregnated with carbon, making those
sections opaque to x rays (see Fig. 19.3). The
carbon-impregnated areas are then clearly visible.
At 100 psi the mercury penetrates all pores larger
than 17 p and at 10,000 psi, 0.17 . By varying
the mercury pressure, we can observe where the
effective carbon sealant is located. Figure 19.3
shows a 10-mil-thick section from a specimen
that has been carbon sealed at 800°C. The disk
was pressurized to 1000 psig in mercury and then
radiographed. The darker rim shows the area that
has been carbon impregnated. Other disks from
this same specimen were mercury impregnated to
5000 and 10,000 psig. At higher mercury pres-
sures the darker rim became thinner, indicating
that the effective sealant is located near the
surface of the substrate. The maximum depth of
carbon penetration as shown in Fig. 19.3 is about
15 mils. The depth of penetration needed for
effective sealing must be determined from results
of irradiation behavior.

We prepared 12 specimens for irradiation in the
HFIR. The substrates were machined from Poco
grade AXF graphite, and some were heat treated
to 3000°C prior to impregnation at various tem-
peratures. Some of the impregnated specimens
were then heat treated to 3000°C to graphitize
the impregnant. The samples are being irradi-
ated in the HFIR to a fluence of ~1 x 1022
neutrons/cm?. The behavior of these specimens
should provide us with information as to the type
of sealant and depth of sealant penetration needed
to maintain a sufficiently low permeability during
high fast-neutron exposure.

of minimum deposit thickness vs reduction in
pressure that was presented previously.* The
surfaces of these samples were rougher in appear-
ance than previous samples annealed in air, and,
of course, very much rougher than a sample an-
nealed in argon. The results of these tests indi-
cate that (1) the air anneal had an inconsistent
but always detrimental effect on sample porosity;
(2) a rough sample surface is more difficult to
seal; and (3) the plot of minimum deposit thick-
ness vs reduction in pumping pressure is valid,
but precoating surface preparation does influence
the effectiveness of a given coating thickness.
Unfortunately, we also established that the argon
anneal will not remove fingerprints from the sam-
ple. These are disastrous to the coating process.

ORNL-4254, pp. 192-94,

Finally, these samples verified that most of the
air-fired samples could not be sealed sufficiently
by an acceptable amount of molybdenum (0.2 mil).
A differential pressure coating technique for
depositing the molybdenum in the graphite pores
had been attempted previously* but was hampered
by inability to obtain a vacuum seal around the
graphite during heating. A technique for brazing
specimens to a molybdenum tube was developed
by the Welding and Brazing Laboratory. Eighteen
samples were impregnated at 700°C at either 5 or
10 torrs using the differential pressure technique.
The time of deposition varied from 5 to 20 min,
and all samples were annealed at 600°C in argon
prior to coating. Despite the anneal, four sam-
ples had fingerprints which destroyed the effec-
tiveness of the coating. Inhomogeneous nodular
deposits formed on some samples, but we ob-
tained sufficient data to predict that 0.2 mil or
more of molybdenum would be necessary for even
a completely homogeneous coating to reduce the
helium permeability to the desired range. A radio-
graph of a 20-mil section of a coated sample
showed that very little penetration into the graph-
ite was achieved with the differential pressure
technique.

19.7 GRAPHITE IRRADIATION EXPERIMENTS
C. R. Kennedy

The first long-term, five-cycle, irradiation of
graphite in the HFIR has been completed. Two
target rods containing specimens of the materials
listed in Table 19.7 have been removed from the

233

reactor and disassembled. The specimen assem-
bly was in very good condition, but some diffi-
culty was encountered in disassembly. All lock-
ing pins broke off at the slightest attempt to re-
move them. This required shearing of the pins
before the radial spacers could be removed to
slide the specimens off the stainless steel sup-
port tube. There was also a graphite—stainless
steel interaction, and some of the graphite speci-
mens were bonded to the stainless steel support
tubes. This required excessive force to remove
the specimens, and some were broken, cracked,
or chipped. However, only one specimen was too
badly broken for length measurements to be taken.

There was also a more severe stainless steel—
SiC interaction that resulted in a serious bonding

tors were removed intact. Several other smaller
broken pieces were removed which can possibly
be used to determine the irradiation temperature.
As yet, we have not examined the SiC monitors

to determine the actual temperature, but we feel

234

change basis, as shown in Fig. 19.6, to obtain

an estimate of expected lifetime.

These data are significant in that if these
anisotropic products can be made isotropic, the
linear dimensional change would be one-third of

the volume change.

Therefore those grades show-

that it was clocse to the design temperature of
705°C + 10°C.

These problems can all be eliminated if a
graphite support structure is used in place of the
stainless steel. Unfortunately, the time required
for design and fabrication would cause a serious
delay in the irradiation schedule, and the speci-
mens from these two experiments are being re-
cycled in a similar stainless steel assembly. We
plan to construct future experiments with a graph-
ite support structure.

Dimensional measurements have been made on
the samples from the first two experiments. The
results of the linear dimensional changes are given
in Figs. 19.4 and 19.5 with the exceptions of
Poco and H364 grades. These two materials are
nearly isotropic and have only small changes in
dimensions. The difficulty of comparing graphite
by linear dimensional changes is compounded by
the inability to separate the contributions of
volume change and the anisotropy of the graphite.
It is easier to compare the graphites on a volume

ing a smaller volume change have a greater poten-
tial for reactor use if they can be made isotropic.

Before discussing the trends indicated by the
data, we emphasize that the curves were obtained
from a maximum of three points and that further
irradiations are required to confirm the indicated
trends. The materials that have the smallest
volume change are grades AXF and H364 (both
have the highest degree of isotropy). Both of
these materials seem to expand slightly and then
begin to densify with increasing exposure. These
two grades are high-quality products with a very
fine evenly dispersed porosity and a structure
which appears to be very well bindered. In the
case of the AXF grade, the binder cannot be
identified, and the structure appears to be a well-
integrated single phase. In the H364 material,
we cannot identify the initial coke particles by
metallographic examination. The structure is also
very well bindered, with evidence of heavy im-
pregnations. We expect these well-bindered
products to exhibit very small volume changes and
even a small expansion under irradiation. How-
ever, this tendency for densification after a large
exposure has not been observed previously in
other graphites, and at present the rationale for
such behavior is not understood.

The AXF samples chosen to examine the in-
fluence of final heat treatment and impregnation
have produced results of considerable signifi-
cance. There is a slight effect of graphitizing
temperature and impregnation; however, the main
significance is the lack of difference in the be-
havior. These results amplify the importance of
isotropy and binder integrity in obtaining a dimen-
sionally stable product. These factors appear to
overshadow the effects of high-temperature graph-
itizing treatments. This conclusion may be pre-
mature in that long-term stability may be in-
fluenced by heat treatment.

The dimensional changes of the other two fairly
isotropic graphites, grades UK-Iso and H315-A,
are quite similar. Both of these materials are
more stable than the common anisotropic reactor
grades such as AGOT. These two materials,
along with AGOT, were placed in this experiment
primarily to have a direct comparison with pre-
vious data from other reactors.

Grades AT]-S, 2514, and those obtained from
Y-12 are all anisotropic and have fairly high
linear dimensional change rates. A comparison
of these results suggests some possible effects

235

of raw materials and fabrication on the dimensional
stability under irradiation. A comparison of the
grades BY-12, RY-12-29, and RY-12-31 indicates
an anomalous behavior. It would be expected that
both RY-12-29 and RY-12-31, having a less
graphitic structure, would have a shorter lifetime
than BY-12. However, the data indicate that
RY-12-29 and BY-12 attained their minimum vol-
ume and began to expand, and thus may or may
not have a shortened lifetime, depending upon the
rate of expansion. This type of behavior is again
in conflict with the proposal that the more
graphitic materials should be more dimensionally
stable.

19.8 SMALL-ANGLE X-RAY SCATTERING
MEASUREMENTS IN GRAPHITE

R. W. Hendricks C. ]J. Sparks

The diffraction and scattering of x rays by
crystalline substances can be used to learn many
things about the arrangement of atoms within the
crystal. When the crystal is perfect, x rays will
be diffracted only when the Bragg law is satisfied,
and there will be some low-intensity scattering
due to thermal vibrations. However, real crystals
nomally contain imperfections which cause dif-
fraction to occur under conditions other than those
specified by the Bragg law. Measurements of this
scattering, called diffuse scattering, can be used
to characterize the defects present in the crystal.
We feel that this technique has much promise for
looking at the defects produced in graphite by
irradiation and thus would help us learn more
about the mechanism(s) responsible for radiation
damage in graphite.

X-ray diffraction studies of hot-pressed pyro-
lytic graphite were undertaken to characterize the
structure of the most perfect graphite available.
This material is of theoretical density, and the
basal planes are parallel to the extent that the full
width at half height of the rocking curve is 0.6
to 0.35°. However, the basal planes of graphite
are randomly oriented with respect to rotation
about the c axis. This material is monochromator-
grade graphite from Union Carbide Corporation’s
Parma facilities.

Measurements of x-ray line breadths show no
detectable broadening due to particle sizes being
less than about 1500 A or due to strain. Diffuse
scattering measurements detect no amorphous
carbon present, as all the diffuse intensity can
be attributed to Compton scattering and thermal
diffuse scattering. All the detectable temperature
diffuse scattering is distributed along the ¢ direc-
tion, and the spread is as narrow as the mosaic
spread in the crystal. Thus the only detectable
thermal oscillation of the atoms is perpendicular
to the basal plane.

With this understanding of the structure of
highly perfect graphite, we are now determining

236

the structural changes which take place when this
material is irradiated in a reactor.
results are being interpreted in terms of displaced
atoms, which result in increased diffuse scatter-
ing. In addition, small-angle scattering measure-
ments are being made. They verify the high-angle
results for highly perfect graphite and will be
used to measure electron density variations which

20.1 DEVELOPMENT OF TITANIUM-MODIFIED
HASTELLOY N

C. E. Sessions H. E. McCoy, ]r.

We have found that small additions of titanium
significantly improve the mechanical behavior of
Hastelloy N under irradiation, and we are evaluat-
ing several small heats.

In our development work, we irradiated both
laboratory (2-1b) and commercial (100-1b) heats
of Hastelloy N with varying concentrations of
titanium and carbon. The alloy base composi-
tion is Ni—12% Mo—7% Cr-0.2% Mn. These
alloys have been irradiated in several different
experiments to thermal-neutron fluences of 2 to
5x 10%° neutrons/cm? in the ORR and the ETR.
Although several irradiation temperatures have

been investigated, we shall consider only the
results for specimens irradiated at 500 to 650°C
in order to assess the effects of our titanium
modification on high-temperature irradiation
damage. We shall compare the behavior of the
small laboratory melts with that of larger com-
mercial melts of this material.

A partial list of 100-1b commercial heats on
which we have accumulated preliminary data is
given in Table 20.1. The titanium concentration
varies from 0 to 1.2%, with only a small varia-
tion in carbon content (0.06 to 0.09%). The
ranges of stress-rupture properties listed in
Table 20.1 were obtained from an approximate

stress-rupture life plot based on the few data
points that are available for each heat. All data
considered were for a comparable pretest heat
treatment of a 1-hr anneal at 1177°C in argon,
but undoubtedly they reflect differences in (1)
grain size and (2) thermal aging during the ir-
radiation cycle due to variations in titanium con-
tent.

The properties of these same alloys in the un-
irradiated condition are also given in Table 20.1.
The ranges result from uncertainties due to the
small number of tests available. The 40,000-
psi rupture life at 650°C for unirradiated material
containing no titanium is about 200 hr, and the
fracture strain is 15 and 25%. Small increases
in both rupture life and fracture strain are found
for titanium levels up to 0.3% titanium. A large
increase in both strength and ductility is found
at higher titanium levels; for example, at the
0.99% titanium level the rupture life is about
1500 hr after 35 to 40% strain.

The postirradiation stress-rupture properties
are also given in Table 20.1, and the variation
of the rupture life with titanium content is shown

in Fig. 20.1. All data are for the preirradiation
heat treatment of 1 hr at 1177°C. The postirradia-
tion creep-rupture life at 650°C and 40,000 psi
increases markedly with increasing titanium
levels from approximately S hr at zero titanium

to 3000 hr at 1.2% titanium. At 760°C, where

the creep strength is much lower, we also find

a beneficial strengthening effect of titanium; the
rupture life at 20,000 psi increased from approxi-
mately 0.2 hr at zero titanium to 200 hr at 1. 2%

titanium. At 760°C, a smaller improvement in
rupture life is found for increases in titanium
content above about 0.2% than was observed at
650°C. The postirradiation fracture strain for
the commercial heats varied from 2—-5% for the
heats containing less than 0.27% titanium to 3—
19% for alloys containing 0.5-1.2% titanium.

stressed at 40,000 psi and 650°C had rupture
lives from 45 to 1050 hr. This increase in rup-
ture life was progressive with increasing titanium
from 0 to 1.0%. The fracture strain for the lab-
oratory melts showed an increase with titanium
level from 10 to 27% over the range of titanium
investigated.

The postirradiation creep-rupture results ob-
tained on our laboratory melts are shown in Fig.
20.2. The stress levels are different from those
used for the commercial alloys in Fig. 20.1,
but the curves have very similar shapes and
generally agree quite well. One possible signif-
ficant difference is that at 760°C the properties
of the laboratory heats show continued improve-
ments, whereas the commercial heats indicate
that titanium levels above 0.5% cause no further
improvement. This may be due to an effect of ir-

20.2 AGING OF MODIFIED HASTELLOY N

C. E. Sessions

As part of our evaluation of commercial heats
of titanium-modified Hastelloy N, we are in-
vestigating the thermal stability in the absence
of irradiation. Since the presence of titanium
may affect the aging tendency of the alloys, we
are conducting an aging program on four com-
mercial heats. Each alloy nominally contains
Ni—12% Mo—7% Cr-0.2% Mn—0.06% C, with
titanium concentration (0.15, 0.27, 0.45, and
1.2%) being the only significant variable. We
are presently using the change in the tensile
properties at 650°C and a strain rate of 0.002
min~! to measure aging in these alloys. Aging
temperatures of 760 and 650°C are examined for
three pre-age heat treatments: 1 hr at 1177°C,
1 hr at 1260°C, and 1 hr at 1177°C plus 10%
prestrain at room temperature. We shall eventually
have data for aging times of 1500, 3000, and
10,000 hr; however, at present only the 3000-hr
age results are complete.

The changes in the yield strength and the
total elongation due to aging following our
standard solution anneal of 1 hr at 1177°C are
shown in Fig. 20.3. The yield strength in-
creases after aging at 650 and 760°C, the in-
crease being greater for the 650°C aging treat-
ment. The change in the elongation at fracture
is dependent on both the titanium content and
the aging temperature. Aging at 650°C results
in an increase in total elongation from approxi-
mately 30 to 40% for the three higher titanium
levels and a decrease for the lowest titanium
level. However, the 760°C aging temperature
results in a decrease in tensile elongation from
~ 30 to ~ 15% at the 650°C test temperature for
the three lower titanium levels and an increase
at the 1.2% titanium level.

Figures 20.4 and 20.5 summarize the property
changes following several heat treatments and
aging at 650 and 760°C respectively. Here we
have plotted the fractional change in total
elongation and 0.2% yield strength based on the
unaged samples, with positive values indicating

Fig. 20.3. Dependence of Strength and Ductility on

mmprovement and negative values indicating re-
duction in property with aging. Thus each point
should represent a percentage change due to
aging alone. After aging at 650°C the ductility
varies appreciably with titanium content. Gen-
erally, at low levels the ductility is reduced,

at 0.5% titanium the ductility increases, and at
1.2% titanium the ductility is improved by aging
provided the pre-aging treatment did not in-
volve annealing above 1177°C. The yield
strength increases due to aging, the magnitude
of the increase diminishing with increasing
titanium content. Using a higher solution
annealing temperature (1260°C) or room-tempera-
ture prestraining prior to aging results generally
in higher strengths and lower ductilities fot both
the pre-aged and post-aged samples.

As shown in Fig. 20.5 the aging at 760°C has
resulted in a large (30—60%) loss in ductility
for each heat treatment, except at the 1.2%
titanium level. The yield strengths increase on
aging at 760°C, except for the sample prestrained
10% prior to aging.

the Titanium Content of Modified Hastelloy N.

The optical microstructures after aging at
760°C for 3000 hr are shown in Fig. 20.6. The
three lower titanium levels appear similar, and
the properties of each were also equivalent.
However, the sample with 1.2% titanium exhibits
precipitation, primarily along bands which
probably resulted from fabrication. This partic-
ular sample showed an increased tensile ductility,
yet the large variation in properties of thisheat
with heat treatments (Figs. 20.4 and 20.5) may
be partly attributable to local inhomogeneities
within the original ingot, which are evident as
localized stringers of precipitate particles.

The magnitude of the observed aging effect at
760°C after 3000 hr is cause for some concern,
because we expect creep conditions and neutron
irradiation to further reduce the fracture ductility.
The role of titanium in the aging process is
somewhat confusing, and it appears that titanium
may actually be inhibiting rather than causing
the aging.

TEMPERATURES ON THE POSTIRRADIATION
MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF TITANIUM-
MODIFIED HASTELLOY N

H. E. McCoy, ]Jr.

Our first mechanical property tests on the

titanium-modified Hastelloy N were run with
samples that had been irradiated at 650°C, and

244

The variation of the minimum creep rate with
stress level is shown for these same samples in
Fig. 20.8. In general, the minimum creep rate
is not significantly different in the irradiated
and unirradiated conditions as long as the irradia-
tion temperature does not exceed 660°C. When
irradiated above 704°C the postirradiation creep
rate is increased. Several of the samples were
tested at 760°C, and these results are shown in

(3 1

we found that the properties were excellent at
test temperatures of 760 and 650°C. In addi-
tional experiments we irradiated samples over a
broad temperature range for 1000 hr to a thermal
fluence of 3 x 1029 neutrons/cm? and ran post-
irradiation creep tests at 650 and 760°C. The
stress-rupture properties of these samples

at 650°C are shown in Fig. 20.7. Three heats
of material were involved, with each having the
nominal composition Ni—12% Mo-7% Cr—0.2%
Mn—0.05% C—0.5% Ti. Heat 104 is a 2-1b lab-
oratory melt made by arc melting virgin stock,
and heats 21545 and 66-548 are 100-1b melts
produced by two different commercial vendors.
All three materials have better stress-rupture
properties than irradiated standard Hastelloy N
at 650°C as long as the irradiation temperature
is 660°C or lower. The samples of heat 66-548
failed in shorter times when irradiated at tem-
peratures of 704°C and above.

Fig. 20.9. The creep-rupture properties of all
the titanium-modified alloys are superior to
those of irradiated standard Hastelloy N at
760°C. However, the results on heats 66-548
and 21545 give some indication of an effect of
irradiation temperature, with the rupture life be-
ing reduced as the irradiation temperature is in-
creased.

The fracture strains are shown in Fig. 20.10,
as a function of the minimum creep rate for tests
at 760 and 650°C. Previous studies have shown
that the scatter band in Fig. 20.10 holds for air-
and vacuum-melted standard Hastelloy N when
irradiated and tested at common temperatures of
650 or 760°C.? In Fig. 20.10, there is a group-
ing of points for tests at 650°C on samples ir-
radiated at 660°C or below and for tests at 760°C

alloy without titanium shows similar behavior.
This led us to question whether such effects are
universal for Hastelloy N. We have never per-
formed an experiment directed at evaluating the
effects of irradiation temperature on the creep-
rupture properties of Hastelloy N. We have found
that the properties at 650 and 760°C are not af-
fected markedly by irradiation temperature over
the range of 43 to 650°C, but we have never
tested at 650°C a sample irradiated at 760°C.
Such an experiment is being carried out.

20.4 ELECTRON MICROSCOPE STUDIES
R. E. Gehlbach

20.4.1 Precipitation in Standard Hastelloy N

We have found that the types and behavior of
precipitated phases in Hastelloy N are closely
related to the concentration of silicon in the
alloy.? The presence of more than about 0.2%

Si in the melt causes increasing enrichment of
silicon in the M C-type precipitates. The role

of silicon appears to be that of substituting for
carbon in the precipitates, resulting in an M (C,Si)
which is stable at temperatures higher than the
true M6C.3 However, the M (C,Si) phase trans-
forms to the Mo,Ni,Si intermetallic at tempera-
tures in excess of 1300°C. We have not evaluated
the kinetics of the transformation or the subse-
quent decomposition on exposure to lower tem-
peratures. Preliminary investigations indicate
that decomposition occurs with the formation

of at least M,C [or M,(C,Si)|] and Mo,C. The
high-temperature Mo,Ni,Si intermetallic has been
identified both by x-ray diffraction and by electron
probe microanalysis from extracted particles.

Alloys containing about 0.2% Si or less con-
tain the true M, C, which is put into solid solu-
tion at high annealing temperatures. The high-
temperature silicide phase is not formed. We
have found that decreasing either the silicon or

the molybdenum causes the precipitation of
Mo,C as well as the M;C [or M (C,Si)].

20.4.2 Titanium-Modified Hastelloy N

The microstructure of the titanium-modified
alloy is quite different from that of the standard
material. Major compositional changes which
affect the microstructure and precipitates which
form include decreasing the molybdenum from 16
to 12% and the silicon from 0.6 to 0.02% or less.
As a result the M C-type precipitates, which
comprise the stringer and grain-boundary phases
in the original version of the alloy, are absent.

Unlike the standard alloy, precipitates in the
modified Hastelloy N are put into solid solution
at normal annealing temperatures. Exposure at
temperatures similar to those expected in service
results in both grain boundary and matrix precipi-
tation. Figure 20.12 shows a typical mode of
precipitation in and adjacent to the grain bound-
aries after aging at 650°C for 1500 hr. Prelim-
inary indications suggest that the precipitates
are of the Mo,C type. Exposure at 760°C for
similar times results in precipitation of spherical
particles of the Mo, C type.

Figure 20.13 shows the microstructure result-
ing from exposure at 650°C for 1438 hrunder a
stress of 32,350 psi. The grain boundary pre-
cipitate is much finer than that generated by ag-
ing alone (Fig. 20.12), and a very fine, highly
oriented precipitate is generated in the matrix,
probably strain induced. We have identified the
matrix precipitate as Mo,C by electron diffraction
and dark-field electron microscopy.

We have initiated an investigation of the ef-
fects of irradiation temperature on the micro-
structure of Hastelloy N in an attempt to ex-
plain the apparent loss in elevated-temperature
ductility associated with different irradiation
temperatures (see Sect. 19.3). Figure 20.14a
shows a typical grain boundary in an alloy
(66-548) containing 0.48% Ti which was irradiated
for 1128 hr at 635°C and tested in creep at
650°C, 47,000 psi, with a rupture life and fracture
strain of 20.7 hr and 5.2% respectively. The
grain boundaries are quite irregular and contain
an appreciable amount of precipitate. A consider-
able amount of the fine oriented Mo,C matrix
precipitate is formed (Fig. 20.145), probably
either strain or radiation induced or both. This

precipitate is present in much larger quantities
in the irradiated and stressed specimen than in
the one stressed at 650°C for 1438 hr without
irradiation.

In contrast to the specimen irradiated at
635°C (which exhibited good creep ductility),
the grain boundaries of the one irradiated at
703°C were free of precipitate. Owing to the low
fracture strain (0.44% at 21,500 psi and 650°C,
0.85 hr rupture life), the matrix and grain bound-
aries are quite strain-free. Bubbles were ob-
served quite frequently in grain boundaries and
occasionally in the matrix. Figure 20.15 shows
typical bubbles in a grain boundary.

Bubbles were not observed in the material ir-
radiated at 635°C. It is possible that the grain
boundary precipitates would mask bubbles if
they were present, since the strain fields as-
sociated with the particles are quite large com-
pared with usual bubble sizes. Because of the
strain which the sample received, the grain
boundaries are not sharp as in the case of the
703°C material. Thus, if bubbles are present
after irradiation at the lower temperatures, we
have not been able to observe them. We are
planning to examine unstressed sections from
the above specimens, which should provide some
clarification as to the effect of irradiation alone.

Considering the structures we have found in
the irradiated specimens, the difference in me-
chanical properties is not surprising (the micro-
structure in Fig. 20.14 would inhibit the propaga
tion of a grain boundary crack, whereas that in
Fig. 20.15 would favor propagation). We are not
able to explain the differences in structures on
the basis of the few samples examined. Ensuing
work includes evaluating unstressed irradiated
specimens containing titanium as well as
stressed and unstressed irradiated specimens
without titanium to determine the effects of
irradiation, irradiation temperature, stress, aging
time, and temperatures on the microstructure and
mechanical properties of these alloys.

20.5 WELDABILITY OF TITANIUM-MODIFIED
HASTELLOY N

D. A. Canonico A. G. Cepolina

We have obtained our first 5000-1b production
heat of titanium-modified Hastelloy N (heat 7320)

250

and are studying the weldability of this material.

The previous welding studies on 100-1b heats

had shown that the weldability of the titanium-

modified alloy was good under low-restraint con-

ditions. However, the availability of the 5000- :
Ib heat gave us the first opportunity to make
high-restraint welds in large plates. All welds
to date have been made in plates nominally 12
in. long x 6 in. wide x 1/2 in. thick. The weld

% -in.-diam rod of

wire was fabricated from 7
the same heat; 3/32-in.—diarn wire was used for
the first three passes and ' -in.-diam wire for
subsequent passes. One edge of each plate was
prepared for welding, and the two plates were
welded to a 2-in.-thick steel strongback to pro-
vide a high degree of restraint.

The first weld was made using 14 passes.
Upon completion, it was removed from the strong-
back and radiographed. A number of cracks were
seen on the radiograph. The weld was sectioned,
and both photomacrographs and photomicrographs
were taken. Figure 20.16 illustrates the types
of cracks seen in this weld. These are among
the most severe seen during the subsequent

welding study. Figure 20.17 shows the fusion-

line and heat-affected-zone areas of the weld; .
cracking is not a problem in the base metal. -
Weld 2 was made under similar conditions to .

weld 1 except that the surfaces of individual
passes were also inspected by dye-penetrant
techniques. It was found that thefirst weld
pass (root pass) was sound; however, when the
second weld pass was deposited, the first
cracked. These cracks were both parallel and
transverse to the welding direction.

In view of the cracking that resulted from
welding heat 7320 with itself, we decided to
lay out a systematic welding program using the
specified procedures.* Figure 20.18 is a compila-
tion of typical welds undertaken. All thewelds
were made under the highly restrained conditions
discussed previously. Weld No. 4 was made us-
ing weld wire from a previously accepted heat
(5090) of standard air-melted Hastelloy N. This
weld was completed with no crack indications
from both radiographic and dye-penetrant tech- -
niques. Subsequent metallographic studies sub-

stantiated these observations. Weld 5 wasmade

using the specified procedure and filler metal
from heat 7320. Again the root pass cracked
when the second pass was deposited. Welds 6
and 7 were made with both filler and base metal
from heats 67-526 (Hastelloy N with 0.5% Ti)
and 67-550 (modified Hastelloy N with 0.7% T1i),
respectively, and no cracking occurred. This
confirmed previous studies that these heats were
weldable.

Additional welds were made using base metal
of heat 7320 and various filler metals. These
welds are also summarized in Fig. 20.18. In
all instances where heat 7320 was used as the
filler metal, cracking occurred in the root pass
when the second weld pass was deposited. How-
ever, successful welds were made in heat 7320
with filler metal from both heats 67-526 and
67-550 (these welds are identified as 12 and 13
in Fig. 20.18).

Specimens were sectioned from welds 4, 12,
and 13 and subjected to side-bend tests. As
shown in Fig. 20.19, all these welds success-
fully withstood a 180° bend without any indica-
tion of cracks. This side-bend test is severe
and is used extensively in Code qualifications.
If small difficult-to-detect fissures are present
in the weldment, they will open during bending.

Supplementary studies were undertaken in an
effort to explain the unusual cracking problem
observed in weld metal deposited from heat 7320
filler rod. Chemical analyses were made on the
base metal, welding rod, and weld metal deposited
in welds 1 and 2 (Table 20.2). The only obvious
difference that existed between these materials
was in the nitrogen level. The weld deposits
contained approximately 40 ppm nitrogen, com-
pared with 4 ppm in the base metal and the
filler rod. Electron-beam microprobe analyses

did seem to indicate a relationship between the
environment and cracking; however, the vacuum
requirement for eliminating crack indications is
rather stringent. The effect of superimposed
restraint upon the cracking propensity was not
determined.

We also deposited a weld in an inert-gas weld-
ing chamber containing high-purity helium with a
nitrogen content of about 5 ppm. The plates
were under medium restraint during welding. The
joint was dye-penetrant inspected after the third
pass, and the weld metal was found to be crack
free. The weld was completed and again dye-
penetrant inspected. A few very small indica-

tions were noted on the surface. These were
easily removed by a minimal amount of grinding,
and four side-bend specimens were prepared

and tested. After a 180° bend, all four contained
cracks concentrated in the root region of the
weld.

We also investigated the effects of postweld
heat treatments on cracking of bead-on-plate
welds. These gas tungsten arc welds were made
with heat 7320 filler metal deposited on heat
7320 plate. Two sequences were studied. The
first consisted in annealing the plate and first
pass at 870°C for 4 hr; then two subsequent weld
beads were deposited. The second bead over-
lapped the heat-treated bead, and the third bead
overlapped the un-heat-treated bead. The weld
bead annealed at 870°C contained a few small
cracks, whereas the un-heat-treated bead contained
a multitude of cracks; thus postweld heat treating
at 870°C did minimize the cracking. The second
series of welds was similar to the first except that
the first weld bead was annealed at 1180°C for 4
hr. The 1180°C postweld heat treatment elimi-
nated the cracks in the first pass, but the second
pass (not heat treated) did crack when the third
pass was deposited.

Metallographic investigation of the welds
showed that the 1180°C heat treatment produced
a clean coarse-grained microstructure with no
typical weld-metal cast structure (all evidence
of welding was removed). On the other hand,
the 870°C heat treatment had little visual effect
on the weld-metal cast structure. This experi-
ment does seem to support the thesis that micro-
segregation of some element (or elements) is
responsible for the cracking and that its effect
can be negated by a homogenizing postweld heat
treatment. However, the 1180°C temperature is
entirely too high for consideration as a step in
the fabrication procedure.

Based on the above results, we decided to re-
melt material from heat 7320 and make small
alloy additions in an attempt to make a better
filler material. The first melt was made by
arc melting heat 7320 under a partial vacuum
with no additions. Two other melts used heat
7320 with alloy additions to provide alloys with
0.7% Mn and 2.0% Nb. Past experience had
indicated that small amounts of these elements
might be beneficial in reducing cracking. These
remelts were drawn to wire and used as filler
rods. Base metal for these welds was the same
%-in.-thick heat 7320 plate used in the studies
discussed heretofore. The results were negative
and were nearly identical to those observed
previously; that is, the first weld pass cracked
when the second was deposited.

As a result of these studies, we conclude that
heat 7320 is a weldable base metal. There is
no indication of a problem in the heat-affected
zone. However, it is not an acceptable filler
metal. In no instance was a crack-free weld
produced with filler metal from it. The excellent
welds in heats 67-526 and 67-550 indicate that
the titanium-modified alloy can be welded using
similar filler metals. The studies to date indi-
cate that the cracking is due to the segregation
of element(s) presently unidentified.

20.6 MEASUREMENT OF RESIDUAL STRESSES
IN HASTELLOY N WELDS

A. G. Cepolina D. A. Canonico

We are investigating the effects of welding
conditions and postweld heat treatment on the
distribution and magnitude of the residual stresses
in Hastelloy N. The method used for measuring
the residual stresses and the welding and mach-
ining techniques that are employed were dis-
cussed previously.’'® These earlier studies in-
volved the investigation of the effects of stress-

256

relief treatments and gas shielding (helium vs
argon) on the resultant residual stress patterns.
The residual stress patterns were similar for
argon and helium shielding; however, the maximum
residual stress was about 5% higher when helium
was used.® We also found that postweld heat
treatments of 1180°C for 1 hr and 870°C for 6

hr reduced the maximum residual stress to about
500 psi in both cases.® All these welds were
made with a heat input of 15,000 j /in.

We have expanded this work to include a post-
weld anneal of 4% hr at 870°C on welds made
with both argon and helium shielding gases. In
addition, we have investigated a postweld heat
treatment of 650°C for 100 hr on a weld shielded
with argon. The welding parameters used for
these weldments were identical to those re-
ported previously. In addition to the postweld
heat-treatment studies, we have also investigated
the effect of a lower heat input on the distribu-
tion of residual stresses.

Table 20.3 summarizes the results of the post-
weld heat-treatment studies. The earlier welds,
1, 5, 6, and 7, are included for comparison. It is
evident that a postweld heat treatment of 870°C
for 4.5 hr essentially eliminates the residual

stresses, and this is true regardless of the
shielding gas employed. A treatment at 650°C

257

for 100 hr reduces the peak residual stresses by
about 35%; however, they do remain at a high
value after the treatment.

Table 20.4 contains the data obtained from a
weldment deposited at 7500 j/in. (vs 15,000
j/in. for the previously discussed weldments).
The lower heat input decreased the peak tangential
residual stresses; however, it has essentially no
effect on the radial stresses. It is interesting to
note that lowering the heat input had similar ef-
fects on the peak tangential residual stresses as
did the 650°C 100-hr postweld heat treatment.
Figure 20.20 shows the residual stress pattern
obtained for each of these conditions. The lower
heat input resulted in concentrating the stresses
over a narrow distance. The dotted linein the
postweld heat-treatment data (Fig. 20.20a) is a
best approximation of residual stresses in that
area, since we encountered unexplained hard
spots during machining which produced erratic
strain gage measurements.

Thus we have found that lower heat input and
postweld heat treatments are very effective in
reducing the residual stresses in Hastelloy N
weldments. Heat treatments as low as 650°C
for 100 hr cause some improve ments, whereas
treatments of 4.5 and 6 hr at 870°C and 1 hr at
1180°C reduce the stresses to negligible values.

We are studying the compatibility of fluoride
salts with structural materials of interest to the

compatibility of Hastelloy N with fuel, fertile-
fissile, blanket, and coolant salts. The composi-
tions of standard Hastelloy N and the titanium-
modified Hastelloy N are shown in Table 20.5.
Five loops and four capsules are presently in

Loop 1258, constructed of type 304L stainless
steel and containing the same salt as loop 1255,

changes in flow characteristics. In January 1967,
ten new type 304L stainless steel specimens were
placed in the hot leg to examine the corrosive be-
havior of the old fuel salt. A specimen exposed
at the highest temperature, 688°C (1270°F), was
removed for detailed metallurgical analysis after
5700 hr of exposure between May 1967 and Februar
1968. (An original specimen exposed 3700 hr was

age, many of the thermocouples are no longer

placed in the salt in the hot leg, and an accurate
temperature profile was obtained. Present read-
ings indicate the salt is about 10°C hotter than
indicated by the old surface thermocouples. The
diffusion coefficients calculated from these new
data are only slightly different from those pre-
viously reported, that is, 4.0 x 10~ 1% cm ?/sec at

and 676°C (1250°F) show smaller weight changes
than the standard Hastelloy N specimens at 660°C
(1220°F). Calculation of the diffusion coefficient
from weight change data on the modified alloy
specimen at the highest temperature was made
after 4700 hr exposure and was found to be 5.0 x
10—'% cm?/sec at 704°C. This agrees with pub-
lished data for chromium diffusion in Hastelloy N
where experiments were done in fuel salts. 8

The calculation was based only on chromium re-
moval since the titanium-modified specimens con-
tain no iron. Increases in chromium (from 15 to
200 ppm) and iron (from 35 to 95 ppm) have been
noted in the salt, most of the increase no doubt
coming from the loop piping.

Loop 19 is completely installed and ready for a
flush charge. It is constructed of standard Hastel-
loy N and will be filled with a fertile-fissile salt
that will contact molten bismuth in a molybdenum
hot finger. If bismuth is even slightly soluble in
the salt, the corrosion rate of the Hastelloy N
should be increased markedly. This experiment
is in support of a one-fluid, two-region MSBR and
the bismuth fuel-processing scheme.

A companion loop, NCL-18, will soon be in-
stalled and begin circulating the same fertile-
fissile salt. This loop will provide base-line
compatibility data on the Hastelloy N with this
salt in the absence of bismuth.

20.7.2 Blanket Salts

The operation of NCL-15, containing a typical
two-fluid MSBR blanket salt, was interrupted after
2000 hr as the result of a blown fuse. The salt
in the loop was frozen before power was restored,
and when heat was applied to thaw the salt, the
hot leg ruptured (Fig. 20.24). The ruptured area,
which still contained frozen salt, was cut from the
loop, and another piece of tubing was attached by
means of compression-type fittings. Then the
loop was heated, the salt was melted and dumped,
and the test specimens were removed. The tem-
porary fitting was removed, and the joints to be
welded were reamed to remove any remaining salt
and corroded metal and filed to provide the proper
weld joint configuration. Welding was done in
conformance with specifications PS-23 and PS-25
and inspected under specification MET-WR-200.
The first welding attempt was unsuccessful be-
cause of poor penetration from excessive gas pres-
sure in the loop. The second attempt was suc-
cessful and demonstrates that a successful weld
can be made on material that has contained a
molten salt.

A plot of the weight change of all the specimens
from NCL-15 before the loop failure is given in
Fig. 20.25 as a function of time and temperature.
Similar to the results from NCL-16, the titanium-
modified specimens exhibit smaller weight changes
than the standard alloy specimens. The diffusion
coefficient was calculated from weight change
data after 1600 hr of operation and found to be

8 x 10~ 1% cm?/sec at 676°C (1250°F) in the
blanket salt environment. Increases in the chromi-
um (25 to 40 ppm) and iron (30 to 50 ppm) in the
salt were very small. The repaired loop, NCL-15A,
has now operated satisfactorily for 362 hr with

salt from the same batch used.

20.7.3 Coolant Salts

For over 4000 hr, NCL-13 and -14, containing
the NaBF ,-NaF (92-8 mole %) fluoroborate salt,
operated under identical conditions. Loop NCL-13
contained standard Hastelloy N specimens, and
NCL-14 contained titanium-modified Hastelloy N
specimens. As reported before, the standard alloy
specimens show larger weight changes than the
titanium-modified specimens.

After 4700 hr of operation, the helium gas regu-
lator which provides the overpressure to NCL-13
failed and caused a surge of gas to the loop which
stopped the salt flow. Circulation of the salt
could not be resumed until a vacuum was pulled on
the loop, which we believe removed a gas pocket.
Shortly after circulation was achieved, an electri-
cal short, which eventually burned out a heater,
occurred and heated the bottom of the hot leg to
871°C (1600°F). This disrupted the flow, caused
a loss of BF, from the loop which changed the
salt composition, and plugged all the gas lines.
The loop was drained of all salt, and plugged lines

were replaced or unplugged. Other necessary re-
pairs to the loop were made, and the loop was
filled with new salt. We are, at present, experienc-
ing difficulty in getting the salt to circulate.

The weight changes measured for the specimens
in NCL-13 and -14 after 4300 hr of exposure
to the salt showed increases above those expected
on the basis of the prior behavior (Fig. 20.26).
This was accompanied by perturbations in salt
chemistry. Salt analyses of the circulating salts
from NCL-13 and -14 showed increases in both
H,0 and oxygen contents from <1000 to >2000 ppm
and increases in nickel and molybdenum from <25
to >100 ppm along with a ‘‘normal’’ increase of
chromium and iron. The increase of the chromium
and iron content in the salt with time is shown in
Fig. 20.27.

The dumped salt from NCL-13 was chemically
analyzed, and the results are given in Table 20.8.
The Cr, Fe, Ni, Mo, O, and H,O contents of the
salt all show large increases since the loop began

operation. Increases in the nickel and molybdenum
content of the salt are usually indicative of the
onset of stronger oxidizing conditions, usually due
to the increased water and/or oxygen content. Thus
the most obvious explanation of the chemical
changes and increased weight changes is the
presence of water contamination that produces HF,
which attacks all the constituents of the con-
tainer material.

We have not positively identified the source of
the contamination, which appears to have been

introduced into both loops at the same time. Three
possible sources are (1) impure helium — the loops
had a common helium header, but the helium is
high-purity stock, analyzed prior to use to assure
its purity; (2) impurities on the hanger rods —
these rods were changed out in both loops just
before the high corrosion rates were noticed; and
(3) impurities on the specimens — the specimens
were removed, weighed, and replaced in each loop
at about the same time. We took normal precau-
tions to avoid contamination via sources 2 and 3
but are presently reexamining our procedures.

20.7.4 Haynes Alloy No. 25 Corrosion

While specimens were out of NCL-13 and NCL-14
for weighing after 4000 hr of exposure to fluoro-
borate salt, the hottest and coldest specimens from
each loop were cut in half and sent for microprobe
analysis to determine possible composition gradi-
ents due to mass transfer. Initial results showed
that a large amount of cobalt had deposited on
both the hot- and cold-leg specimens.

Investigations were immediately launched to de-
termine the source of the cobalt, and it was dis-
covered that the specimen support rods were
Haynes alloy No. 25 (Co-19% Cr—14% W-9 Ni—-1%
Fe) rather than Hastelloy N. Further investigation
revealed that the source of the %-in. Haynes alloy
No. 25 material was a misidentified storage carton.
Subsequently the specimens and hangers were re-
moved from NCL-13 and NCL-14, and the specimen
hanger rods were replaced with 1/e’-in. Hastelloy N.
Metallurgical examination was made of the Haynes
alloy No. 25 rod and the Hastelloy N specimens
from NCL-13.

Electron microprobe analysis of the specimens
disclosed thin surface layers which contained
appreciable amounts of cobalt. There was an

average of 1.8 wt % cobalt on the surface of the
hot-leg specimen and an average of 7.3 wt % on
the surface of the cold-leg specimen. These re-
sults were substantiated by x-ray fluorescence
measurements.

Samples of the Haynes alloy No. 25 rod were
taken at various elevations and analyzed by x-ray
fluorescence. It was found that chromium and
cobalt were leached from the rod in all positions.
It appears that two modes of mass transfer were
operable: temperature gradient mass transfer and
activity gradient mass transfer. The chromium and
cobalt removed from the Haynes alloy No. 25 de-
posited on the Hastelloy N because of the smaller
concentrations of those elements as compared with
the Haynes alloy No. 25, whereas nickel and iron
deposited on the Haynes alloy No. 25 for the same
reason.

We took advantage of the situation to learn some-
thing about the kinetics of cobalt movement in
the system. The amount of cobalt in the cold-leg
specimen was determined as a function of position.
Using a solution to Fick’s second law, the diffu-
sion coefficient of cobalt in the Hastelloy N was
determined and found to be 5.6 x 107 !5 cm?/sec
at 465°C (870°F). It is difficult to compare this
number with other diffusion coefficients because
no prior diffusion work has been found on the
cobalt—Hastelloy N system. Comparable work in
somewhat similar systems has been done at much
higher temperatures, where extrapolation to lower
temperatures could become quite erroneous due to
grain-boundary diffusion and/or short-circuiting.
However, in the light of the previous stipulations,
it is interesting to compare the extrapolated dif-
fusion coefficient of titanium in Hastelloy N at
465°C with that obtained for cobalt. Titanium,
like cobalt, is present in Hastelloy N only in small
amounts, 0.5 wt %. An extrapolated diffusion co-
efficient of titanium at 465°C (870°F) is 1.0 x
10~?! cm?/sec.® Thus the movement of cobalt is
appreciably faster.

It was concluded that the presence of the Haynes
alloy No. 25 in the fluoroborate salt—Hastelloy N
system caused variations in the weight change
measurements of the specimens but only to a maxi-
mum extent of 10%. This figure is well within the
experimental accuracy, and therefore no changes

were made in the early conclusions regarding the
compatibility of Hastelloy N and fluoroborate salt.

20.7.5 Flow Velocity in Natural
Circulation Loops

In cooperation with the MIT Practice School,
measurements of the flow velocity of the salt in
NCL-1258 and NCL-14 have been made.!® A two-
counter method was used, with the radioactive
isotope introduced into the loop as a solid salt.
The velocity of the salt was found to be 3.5 fpm in
NCL-1258 and 7.0 fpm in NCL-14. By inserting
these velocities, physical properties of the salt,
and other quantities into flow equations, we ob-
tained values for previously unknown variables.
Utilizing this information, it is then possible to
calculate the flow velocity of the salt in other
loops. The calculated flow velocity was 1.3 fpm
for NCL-15 and 5.0 fpm for NCL-16. Work is con-
tinuing on this project.

20.8 FORCED CONVECTION LOOP

P. A. Gnadt W. R. Huntley

The MSR-FCL-1 forced circulation loop is being
operated to evaluate the compatibility of standard
Hastelloy N with NaBF -NaF (92-8 mole %) coolant
salt at conditions similar to those expected in the
MSRE coolant circuit. During this reporting period
the loop assembly was completed, and circulation
of the salt cleaning charge has just started. Fig-
ure 20.28 is a photograph of the main piping sys-
tem for the loop. This photograph was taken before
the thermal insulation was installed. Figure 20.29
is a photograph of the completed loop installed in
the test facility.

A decision was made to alter the originally pro-
posed loop temperature profile to more nearly ap-
proximate the MSR coolant circuit conditions with
fluoroborate salt. The originally proposed and
presently planned loop temperatures are listed in
Table 20.9. These changes in operating tempera-
ture impose a higher salt temperature at the pump
bowl. Since the vapor pressure of the BF, is
higher due to the increased salt temperature in the

duce the possibility of a change in salt composi-
tion.

The original plan for this test loop was to purge
the LFB pump oil seal with a gas mixture of 1%
BF . in helium. Earlier long-term tests !'! had in-
dicated that small (0.1% by volume) concentrations
of BF , in helium would not greatly affect the
Gulfspin-35 oil used on the pump seal. However,
the temperature increase at the pump bowl required
a purge gas mixture of 3% BF, in helium to match
the new salt BF ; vapor pressure, and it was neces-
sary to examine the effects of He-3% BF ; gas
mixture on Gulfspin-35 pump oil under conditions

269

which would simulate its use in the LFB pump
seal oil system. The results of the two separate
room-temperature tests of approximately one week’s
duration with a predicted test loop gas flow rate of
80 cc/min and a seal oil leakage rate of 10 cc/day
indicated that the seal oil purge line would prob-
ably become plugged during loop operation. A
black sludge was formed in the simulated oil catch
basin which, in the first test, eventually plugged
the 1/B-in.-diam overflow port. In both tests the

oil removed from the test apparatus was darkened
and extremely acid, with a pH of from 1.0 to 1.5.

A large amount of black sludge formed in the
bottom of the simulated seal oil catch basin.

Attempts to determine the composition of the oil
sludge were not successful. However, this effect
of BF ; on Gulfspin-35 is similar to, but more
severe than, effects noted during a previous 3500-
hr experiment in which the BF, concentration in
the gas phase was about 0.1% by volume. The
conclusions from this previous test were that BF,
does not polymerize the oil to a degree that
would change its viscosity, but evidently some
unidentified oil additives are seriously degraded.
These findings, together with those obtained on
the PKP loop test, are being evaluated further by
the Analytical Chemistry Division.

These tests indicated that the He—3% BF3 mix-
ture should not be used for the pump seal purge.

A system was designed and necessary equipment
was procured to provide a method of adding BF,
directly to the pump bowl. With the newly designed
system the BF, must diffuse up an annulus around
the pump shaft against a helium stream before it
can contact the oil in the seal leakage catch basin.

To expedite loop startup, the sodium fluoroborate
cleaning charge in the test loop was circulated
without BF, addition to the pump bowl. A flow of
pure helium was used to purge oil leakage from the
pump oil catch basin. Modification to the seal
purge system will be made after the cleaning
charge has been removed.

The 1/4-in.-OD copper tubing vent line for the
test loop pump seal purge plugged approximately
two weeks after the He—3% BF | mixture was
vented through the line during calibration of the
thermal conductivity cell. A crystalline reaction
product completely sealed the end of the 1/4—in.
tube and stopped the seal purge. An acid solution
was found in a vertical section of line when it
was removed to correct the plugged condition.
This same condition occurred twice in the week-

long cleaning charge operation of the salt loop,
where the effluent 80 cc/min helium purge picked
up about 0.5% BF , from the pump bowl. The
second plug was tight enough that it held a 4-psig
pressure. In all instances of plugging of these
lines, it was necessary to remove the end of the
vent line to restart the purge system. The plug is
apparently boric acid, which is formed by the re-
action of BF , and moisture. Additional equipment
will be required in these vent lines to eliminate
the BF ; and air reaction at the end of the pump
seal vent. Acid has also formed in ventilation
hoods in the vicinity of the BF3 vent lines.
Enough acid has been present to form droplets on
the lower edges of the hoods.

Circulation of the salt cleaning charge is under
way; however, flow in the system is not as high
as expected, and investigations are in progress to
determine the cause of the low flow.

20.9 OXIDATION OF Ni-Mo-Cr-Fe ALLOYS
B. McNabb

The desire for improved radiation resistance
prompted a modification of Hastelloy N. A study
was made of the effects of various alloying addi-
tions on the scaling resistance. Small rods 0.25
in. in diameter were oxidized at 982°C for 1000 hr
with cycling to room temperature every 25 hr. We
have shown previously!? that silicon has a very
beneficial effect on the scaling resistance and
that titanium has a slightly detrimental effect.

Figures 20.30 and 20.31 summarize the effects
of various alloying additions on the scaling re-
sistance of Hastelloy N. The titanium and zir-
conium additions were made to remelts of commer-
cial air-melted Hastelloy N, and the other alloys
were made from virgin melting stock. The results
are complicated by the fact that the effects of the
various elements are not independent of one an-
other. For example, we find that manganese is
slightly detrimental when added to a base alloy
containing no silicon, but beneficial when added
to an alloy containing 0.5% Si. Our studies gener-
ally class Si, Al, Zr, Fe, and W as improving the
scaling resistance and Cr, Ti, and Mo as being
detrimental.

21.1 INTRODUCTION

H. E. McCoy, Jr.

The two-fluid MSBR concept required that
graphite pipes be joined to a Hastelloy N header,
and we began work to develop this joint. This
work was quite rewarding, and several methods of
joining were partially developed, along with in-
spection procedures. However, the present single-
fluid concept does not require such a joint in the
core, and we have curtailed this work. Graphite
looks attractive from a compatibility standpoint
for use in making chemical processing equipment,
and some of the techniques for joining graphite
and Hastelloy N will very likely be useful for this
application.

21.2 GRAPHITE BRAZING
W. J. Werner

Using procedures that we previously established
for brazing molybdenum to molybdenum-coated
graphite with copper,! we assembled a large
graphite—molybdenum—Hastelloy N transition
joint. The components were approximately 3%
in. OD x 7 in. wall. After brazing, the joint was
examined visually and radiographically and found
to be sound. The joint was then thermally cycled
(in an argon atmosphere) 60 times between 200
and 700°C.

After the 1st, 3d, 5th, 10th, 20th, and 60th
cycles, the joint was brought to room temperature
and inspected radiographically. No evidence of
cracking was found. After 60 cycles, the joint
was further evaluated by tensile testing at room

temperature. Figure 21.1 shows the joint configura-
tion and the location of failure in the tensile test.
The joint broke in the base graphite at a large
distance from the graphite-metal braze, but near a
threaded joint used to facilitate testing. The

load at failure was 2650 Ib, and the corresponding
uniform stress in the graphite was 500 psi, a

factor of about 3 lower than would be expected

for this grade of graphite (equivalent to AT]J).

We examined the effect of various surface con-
ditioning or cleaning treatments on the wetting and
flow of brazing alloys on graphite. Samples of
Poco AXF graphite were polished through 6/0-
grit paper and then submitted to the following
treatments:

1. none (as polished),

2. ultrasonically cleaned for 30 sec in ethyl
alcohol,

3. ultrasonically cleaned, vacuum annealed at
1300°C for 1/2 hr,

4. ultrasonically cleaned, air annealed for % hr

Small samples of graphite subjected to each

(wt %) alloy and with the Ni-Pd-Cr alloy. Metal-
lographic examination of the samples revealed no
differences in wettability within each set of
brazed specimens. A clean machined surface
seems to be sufficient. However, a possible ef-
fect of one pretreatment is shown in Fig. 21.2.
The % -hr air anneal at 600°C has opened up
surface-connected voids in the graphite. Even
here , however, the braze is sound. No difference

sample, the as-polished sample, and the sample
vacuum annealed at 1300°C for % hr.

21.3 GRAPHITE-HASTELLOY N TRANSITION
JOINT DEVELOPMENT

J. P. Hammond

Considerable progress was made on the graded
transition joint for minimizing damaging thermal
strain in joints of graphite to Hastelloy N. The
conceptual design, presented in detail in the last
semiannual report,? uses a series of nickel-matrix
tungsten dispersions for spanning the large gap
in thermal expansion between graphite and Hastel-
loy N. In addition, it incorporates premium grades
of graphite or graphite-carbide composites to re-
duce the dimensional instability associated with

.
irradiation of nuclear graphite. The exploration
of heavy-metal compositions for the alloy portion
of this joint has been completed. Acceptable
brazing procedures for joining segments were de-
veloped, and a number of composite joints were
fabricated and tested.

21.3.1 Heavy-Metal Alloy Development

We investigated several groups of tungsten- and
molybdenum-base alloys and found that tungsten
with nickel and iron additives at a 7/3 ratio gave
far superior fabrication characteristics. This can
be seen by the data in Table 21.1. We desired
alloys that liquid-phase sintered to a micro-
structure having a ductile nickel alloy phase com-
pletely enveloping the otherwise fragile heavy-
metal grains. The evaluation of cold rollability
reflects on the general ability of the alloy to be
fabricated and its ability to take thermal strain.

Tungsten alloys Nos. 1 and 2 (Table 21.1) are
familiar compositions.3* Of these and their
molybdenum counterparts (alloys Nos. 3 through
5), the 90W-7Ni-3Fe (wt %) composition gave
distinctly superior results. Alloys Nos. 6 through
11 show the characteristics of the tungsten-con-
taining material as a function of increasing addi-
tive or matrix content and demonstrate its good
fabrication qualities over a range of compositions
applicable to composite joints.

Various ternary and quaternary compositions

based on molybdenum were explored, since neutron

displacement damage will anneal at a lower tem-
perature in molybdenum than in tungsten. Thus
alloys with Ni-Pt, Ni-Pd, and Cu-Pd as binary
additives (Nos. 12 to 14) and Ni-Cu-Pd, Ni-Fe-Cu,
and W-Ni-Fe as ternary additives (Nos. 15 to 34)
were investigated; however, none of these appear
to have sufficiently attractive as-fabricated
properties to warrant their substitution for the
tungsten material.

The fairly good cold rollability displayed by
the molybdenum alloy with W-Ni-Fe as the addi-

tive (alloys Nos. 27 to 32) was somewhat surpris-
ing, as it had been considered that brittle inter-
metallic phases, such as the NiMo compound
present in the matrix of alloy No. 3, were chiefly
responsible for poor deformability in these ma-
terials. A more important factor is now believed
to be a closeness in hardness (resistance to de-
formation) between the matrix and heavy-metal
grains in these materials. The presence of tung-
sten in heavy-metal alloys (Nos. 6 to 11 and Nos.
27 to 32) may be contributing favorably to cold
rollability by significantly increasing the hard-
ness of the matrix phase relative to that of heavy-
metal grains, whereas in the case of the non-
tungsten-bearing alloys, the matrix is quite soft
in comparison with the heavy-metalgrains. The
validity of this consideration is being examined.

The molybdenum alloys with W-Ni-Fe (Nos. 27
to 32) and Ni-Fe-Cu (Nos. 25, 33, and 34) as
additives show adequate capacity for deformation
but are marginal or unacceptable because of their
““compact shaping’’ characteristics (see Table
21.1). This refers to the external physical
qualities of fabricated compacts and the ability
to sinter those of high matrix content without a
tendency toward globbing. The W-Ni-Fe alloys
must be rated very good with respect to the
globbing tendency, while the Mo-W-Ni-Fe alloys
are very poor.

21.3.2 Fabrication and Testing of Joints

Several preliminary composite joints of the
description illustrated in Fig. 21.3 were fabricated
for testing. Although the basic concept includes
an irradiation-resistant graphite segment, a nu-
clear grade was substituted for these experiments
since none of the former was available at the
time. The favorable distribution of expansion
coefficients of the individual segments of this
joint in relation to those for graphite and Hastel-
loy N can be seen in Fig. 21.4; this correlates
composition with coefficient of expansion.

These composites were made by fabricating the
segments individually and copper-brazing them
together in vacuum under a light load. Bonding
of the heavy-metal alloys was not difficult, since
copper wets them and is soluble in their matrices.
Bonding of graphite, on the other hand, was dif-
ficult. Brazingmaterials covered in the litera-

on the corrosion resistance of these joints to MSR
salts await completion.

The main work presently under way is concerned
with minimizing the number of segments in a joint
and reducing cost. We shall do this by taking as
large a step in coefficient of expansion as practi-
cal in the graphite portion of the joint, since
graphite has a very low modulus of elasticity —
about two orders below that for the heavy metals.
This would require fewer heavy-metal alloy seg-
ments. This idea appears good since the graphite
materials of highest irradiation stability generally
have the highest expansion coefficients, and thus
transitions in dimensional stability and thermal
coefficient can be imparted simultaneously.

Recent coefficient of expansion determinations
on the irradiation-resistant Poco graphite gave a
very high value of 7.91 pin./°C. Three-segment
joints incorporating Poco graphite and 80 and 60%
W heavy-metal alloys ate being prepared for test.
The relative magnitudes of the coefficients of the
materials of construction are shown graphically
in Fig. 21.4. Observe that at the junction be-
tween the graphite and heavy-metal alloy, where
concern for cracking is greatest, joining is made
on a basis of equal expansion coefficient. The
joint actually reduces to two transition segments
if we wish to join Hastelloy N to a graphite hav-
ing a coefficient of thermal expansion as high as
Poco.

21.4 NONDESTRUCTIVE TESTING OF
GRAPHITE-TO-METAL JOINTS

H. L. Whaley K. V. Cook

We made improvements to the ultrasonic pulse
echo technique for evaluation of tubular graphite-
to-metal brazed joints. A reference standard was
prepared in an attempt to simulate areas of bond
and nonbond. This new standard allowed better
assurance of more quantitative results and better
reproducibility. The technique is currently ap-
plicable only to the first inch of the tapered brazed
joint, since this has the greater metal thickness.
Above this point the molybdenum shell wall be-
becomes prohibitively thin for resolution of the
ultrasonic echoes.

A graphite-to-molybdenum joint was brazed with
Ni-Pd-Cr for study. The joint was brazed at a
temperature where the Ni-Pd-Cr would not flow
well in order to obtain a defective joint for study.
A plan view recording of a section of the standard
is shown in Fig. 21.5a. The black areas represent
nonbond, and the light area is due to a piece of
tape placed on the standard to simulate a bonded
area. The sample was run with the same gain,
and the recording shown in Fig. 21.556 was obtained.
The white areas indicate bond and show that
only about 30% of the joint was brazed.

N that has been exposed to fluoride salts for
long periods of time. We wanted to make welds
in some of our small tensile samples from the
MSRE surveillance program to gain some insight
into the difficulty of making these welds and into
the mechanical properties of the joint.

In order to make fusion welds (no filler metal
added) on the irradiated tensile specimens, it was
necessary to design a special welding fixture
which could be operated remotely in a hot cell.
We aimed for a reasonable assurance of good
penetration (high percentage of cross section of
specimen to be weld metal) without specimen dis-
tortion. Figure 22.1 is a photograph of the weld-
ing fixture assembled for use in the hot cell. As
can be seen, the fixture consists of a rigid stand,
a motor-driven chuck, a specimen support, and a
TIG welding torch. The upper support has an
internal curved surface that contacts the fillet
radius of the tensile sample and keeps the
sample aligned during welding. The torch was
connected to a programmed welding power supply
located outside the hot cell, The welding con-
ditions were adjusted to obtain penetration of
about 75% of the sample cross section.

22.1.2 Mechanical Properties of Hastelloy N
Welded After Irradiation

H. E. McCoy

The fixture described in the previous section
was used to make fusion passes in the gage por-
tion of several of our surveillance samples. Our
test specimens are only 0.125 in. in diameter,
and the welding parameters that we used fused
about 75% of the cross section. This weld in-
volves lower restraint and heat input than would
be involved in most remote repair operations. One
group of surveillance samples had been exposed
to the MSRE cell environment of nitrogen contain-
+

ing 2 to 5% oxygen for 20,800 hr at 650°C and
was oxidized; the thermal fluence was 2.6 x 101°
neutrons/cm?. The other samples were exposed
to the fuel salt in the core of the MSRE for 15,300
hr at 650°C; the thermal fluence was 9.4 x 102°
neutrons/cm?. Thus we were confronted with re-
moving a thin oxide film of about 0.002 in. in one
case and very small amounts of residual salt in
the other case. We used 240-grit emery paper and
acetone cleaning to remove both contaminants.
We welded about 25 unirradiated samples before
welding the irradiated samples, and 100% of the
welds were sound by visual examination. We
welded 15 irradiated samples, with 3 welds com-
pletely unsatisfactory and 2 others very question-
able due to surface cracks; thus only 67% were
sound by a visual examination. The bad welds
occurred rather randomly among the two groups of
samples. We suspected that much of the difficulty
was associated with cleanliness and tried con-
tinually to improve our cleaning techniques. Our
final technique was removing about 0.002 in. of
material by abrasion with clean emery paper, fol-

lowed by acetone cleaning. The reliability seemed

to improve, although insufficient samples were in-
volved to prove this rigorously.

279

Our results on the fracture strains of unirradiated
materials are summarized in Table 22.1. The re-
sults generally show the following:

1. At 25°C the weld is stronger than the base
metal, and the fracture occurs in the base
metal, with a resulting high strain at fracture.

2. Stress relieving for 8 hr at 871°C reduces the
strength of the weld and moves the location of
the fracture at 25°C to the weld metal, with a
slightly lower strain at fracture.

3. At 650°C the weld metal is weaker, and the
fracture occuts in the weld metal at only about
half the strain normally associated with
fractures in the base metal. Stress relieving
for 8 hr at 871°C improves the fracture strain
to where it is comparable with that of the base
metal, but the fracture usually occurs in the
weld metal.

4. A sample that was irradiated but had been ex-
posed to salt for 4800 hr was welded and found
to have properties comparable with those of the
samples not exposed to salt.

and welded samples are summarized in Table

unirradiated samples are followed with the excep-
tion that the tendency to fail in the base metal is
much higher for the irradiated samples. This is
very likely associated with the relative toughness
of the weld metal and base metal for the two cases.
In unirradiated materials the weld metal is the
weaker, and in irradiated materials the weld metal
is probably superior since it has been melted and
the influences of irradiation have been removed.
Two of the irradiated samples tested at 25°C failed
in the weld metal at low strains, and it is likely
that the welds in these samples were defective.
The microstructure of a sample welded and
tested at 650°C is shown in Fig. 22.2. The
fracture is clearly in the base metal, but the weld

1

metal strained considerably. The porosity as-
sociated with the weld is a striking feature. Some
voids are formed alongthe carbide stringers, and
our previous work! has shown that these carbide
stringers do melt at a lower temperature than the
base metal. Much of the porosity is located at
the fusion line and within the weld metal. We

feel that this is more likely associated with
cleanliness rather than with the release of helium
formed during irradiation.

Thus we have been able to make satisfactory
welds in Hastelloy N that has been irradiated and
exposed to fluoride salts. There is an added de-
gree of difficulty in making welds in these ma-
terials, probably associated with cleanliness.
The sound welds have properties as good as the
irradiated base metal, if not better. These welds
have been made with low heat input and low re-
straint, and more difficulty may be encountered
with large section sizes.

22.2 MOLTEN-SALT DISTILLATION
EXPERIMENT

The Chemical Technology Division has designed
and constructed a vessel for distilling molten
salts to remove fission products. The still is
constructed of Hastelloy N and operates at a
maximum temperature of 1000°C. This tempera-
ture is quite high for Hastelloy N, and we were
concerned over whether the corrosion rate would
be too high. We devised a surveillance program
that would allow us to follow the corrosion of the
Hastelloy N and to examine the compatibility of
several other potential structural materials. After
the still operated for over 4300 hr, we removed the
surveillance samples for examination.

During the course of operation a plug formed in
the salt feed line to the still. A plugged section
was made available for us to examine metal-
lographically.

22.2.1 Examination of Specimens from the
Distillation Experiment

W. H. Cook

The materials included in the still were alloy
82 (Ni—18 Mo), Mo-TZM (M0-0.5 Ti-0.1 Zr),
Haynes alloy No. 25 (Co—10 Ni—20 Cr—-15 W-3
Fe), and Poco AXF graphite.

We wired small coupons into two like sets of
stringers and mounted them on a Hastelloy N sup-
port fixture tack welded to the Hastelloy N dip
line of the vacuum distillation unit, as shown in
Fig, 22.3a. The arrangement and position of each
stringer were such that specimens of each material
were in vapor and liquid zones, with a Hastelloy
N specimen centered at the vapor-liquid interface.

The specimens, the dip line, and the supporting
fixture were returned to us by Unit Operations of

282

the Chemical Technology Division as a unit after
~4300 hr of experiments with LiF-BeF ,-ZrF .
The corrosion specimens are shown in Figs.
22.3b and 22.4 and the dip line in Fig. 22.3c.

A visual check of the samples in the liquid
region showed that the Hastelloy N and alloy 82
were etched slightly and that the surface of
the Mo-TZM was unaltered. The Haynes alloy
No. 25 was severely attacked and broke easily.
The graphite specimens were missing. The
poot performance of the graphite was caused by
air leakage into the system when a heater failure
burned a hole in the argon inlet line to the con-
denser. An indeterminate amount of air was 1>n the
system for about 500 hr with the temperature = 700°C,
Several small crystalline metallic deposits were
found at random on the surfaces of samples in the
liquid region.

A larger Hastelloy N sample was located at the
anticipated liquid-vapor interface. This sample
had gray mat surfaces, but no marks that indicated
the location of the interface.

The specimens in the vapor region had a thin
gray to black film, possibly due to the period of
operation with air present. The Hastelloy N,
alloy 82, and Mo-TZM seemed to be in good
physical condition. The Haynes alloy No. 25
had enlarged, and the graphite samples were
attacked severely.

We have sectioned the Hastelloy N samples
for metallographic examination. There was an
intergranular attack to a depth of 4 mils on the
vapor-zone specimen and an intergranular and
transgranular attack to a depth of 2 mils in the
liquid-zone specimen. There was one atypical
large (~1 x 5 mils) intergranular void in the
liquid-zone specimen. In general, the attack in
the liquid zone was scattered 1-mil-deep attack,
with some oxide on the surfaces and in the voids,
similar to that shown in Fig. 22.5a. There was
concentrated intergranular and transgranular
attack to an average depth of 3 mils in the sample
from thevapor zone (Fig. 22.55). The Hastelloy
N specimen spanning the vapor-liquid interface
showed the same conditions, except that the transi-
tion from the liquid to the vapor region was gradual
and the attack in the vapor zone was only 2 mils.
The absence of aggravated attack at the liquid-
vapor interface and the shallowcorrosion depths
in the liquid and vapor zones indicate that it is
reasonable to use the Hastelloy N vacuum still

LiF, Li BeF,, and/or 6LiF - BeF - ZrF ,, plus
ZrO, monoclinic, which reflects their exposure
to salt and air. Moderate amounts of MoO2 and
WO2 were present on the TZM alloy and the
Haynes alloy No. 25 vapor-zone specimens
respectively. Again this reflects the presence of
air in the system.

presence of a high-nickel alloy, but further analyses
will be required to confirm this.

22.2.2 Examination of Plug from
Distillation Vessel

H. E. McCoy Helen Mateer

After about 120 hr of high-temperature opera-
tion a partial plug formed in the feed line to the
molten-salt distillation vessel. A section of the
plugged line was removed for detailed examina-
tion. The plug, shown in Fig. 22.6, is comprised
of small metallic particles. Annealing twins are
visible at high magnification and thus indicate
that the material has a fcc crystal structure.

Microprobe scans were made across some of the
individual particles for nickel, iron, chromium,
and molybdenum, the principal alloying elements
in Hastelloy N. The particles were very in-
homogeneous; the nickel content ranged from 90
to 8% and the iron content from 4 to 12%. Chromium
and molybdenum were not detected (<1%). Bulk
analysis of the material indicated that aluminum,
tin, and copper might be present, so scans were

also made for these elements. These elements
were not detected, indicating that their respective
concentrations were <1%. These analyses indicate
that the plug most likely did not form from material
that was removed from the Hastelloy N by corro-
sion, since chromium and molybdenum were not
present in the plug.

22.3 X-RAY EXAMINATION
OF BEARING COATINGS

J. E. Epperson

Our present concepts of large molten-salt pumps
do not require bearings that will operate in salt at
elevated temperatures. However, it is likely that
small pumps and valves will be desirable for aux-
iliary uses where the materials must resist self-
welding and wear in molten salts at temperatures
up to 700°C. We presently feel that cermets (spe-
cifically, metal-bonded carbides) offer the most
potential for this application and currently have a
small evaluation program. The cheapest way of
using these materials is to plasma spray the bear-

ing or valve surfaces with a thin layer of the cer-
met. The surfaces can be ground to produce the
desired surface finish.

We are presently evaluating four coatings that
have been applied to small Hastelloy N cylinders
approximately 1 in. in diameter and 1 in. long.
The nominal composition and other pertinent de-
tails are given in Table 22.3. The coatings are
about 3 mils thick and were ground to obtain a
good surface finish. The coating operation was
handled by Mechanical Technology, Inc. (MTI),
although some of the actual coating work was
contracted to other vendors. We plan to evaluate
the respective potential of each coating by thermal
cycling and compatibility studies.

Before these studies were begun, we determined
the species present by x-ray diffraction, and the
results of these studies are summarized in Table
22.3. In the two cases where cobalt was used as
the bonding agent, a carbide of cobalt, Co,C, was
detected, but elemental cobalt was not seen. The
nickel binder in LW-5 was not detected. Compo-
sition inhomogeneities and/or strains were evident
in the diffraction pattern from each of the deposits.
These specimens will be reexamined following the
thermal cycle and compatibility experiments. Di-
mensional variations due to changes in crystal
structure during heating are quite possible in such
complex materials.

22.4 LIQUID LEVEL PROBE ANALYSIS

J. W. Koger A. P. Litman

A liquid level probe failed after only a few hours
in the pump bowl of the PKP-1 forced-circulation
pump loop. The probe, which was constructed from
type 304 stainless steel, was found to be heavily
attacked. We were asked to examine the probe and
to determine the consequences of the attack. The
probe is shown in Fig. 22.7 along with an enlarged
view of the end of the probe which shows the se-
vere corrosion of the material.

The probe had contacted fluoroborate salt

(NaBF ,-NaF, 92-8 mole %) at temperatures from
538°C (1000°F) to 690°C (1275°F) for 192 hr.
Chemical analysis showed that chromium, iron,
manganese, and silicon were severely leached
from the alloy. The corroded end of the probe was
found to be highly ferromagnetic, which was under-
standable in the light of a later chemical analysis

which showed the material to be composed of 78
wt % nickel and 22 wt % iron. Figure 22.8 shows
a metallographic section of an area of the probe
from the heavily attacked end. The microstructure
and chemical analysis above are typical of exten-
sive attack on stainless steel by certain fluoride
salts, more especially by moisture-contaminated
salts. The well-known corrosion cycle involves
selective removal of the more easily oxidized
alloy constituents, especially Cr and Mn, void
formation (the density of the material changes),
void precipitation, and linkage and coalescence.

In analyzing the compatibility of the probe with
the salt, we summarized data from natural circula-
tion loop tests which compare the corrosion of
type 304 stainless steel and Hastelloy N in molten
fluoride salts (Table 22.4). Since Hastelloy N
shows about seven times as much weight loss in
the fluoroborate as it does in fuel salts, the same

analogy, as a first approximation, can be applied
to stainless steel. Thus a weight loss of 175
mg/cm? of material in 5000 hr is indicated for
type 304 stainless steel in fluoroborate salt. Cor-
rosion of this magnitude is excessive but consid-
erably less than what was experienced by the
probe.

There are at least three possible explanations
for the observed high rate of attack: (1) the salt
was generally contaminated, (2) oxidizing impuri-
ties were introduced locally at the probe due to a
leak, and (3) the probe was attacked selectively
since it was the least noble part exposed to a
large volume of salt in an Inconel system. The
last mechanism is probably responsible for the
observed dissolution of an iron sample capsule
in the MSRE, where Hastelloy N is the principal
metallic material. We know of no reasonable way
of distinguishing between these possibilities in
this case.

22.5 FABRICATION OF FLUTED TUBING
FOR ENHANCED HEAT TRANSFER

H. E. McCoy R. E. McDonald

Previous studies have shown that heat transfer
can be enhanced in condensers by using tubing
with roughened or fluted surfaces.® The roughened
surface promotes turbulence and increases the
overall heat transfer coefficient. There is great
incentive for improving the heat transfer by this
technique in molten-salt systems, since this re-
duces the quantity of uranium that is outside the
core in heat exchangers.

Fluted tubing has been fabricated previously
from nickel, copper, and Ni-Cu, materials that are
easier to fabricate than Hastelloy N. We strength-
ened several components of the planetary swager
used in making this tubing and have made several
pieces of fluted ¥-in.-diam Hastelloy N tubing for
heat transfer studies. We varied the fabrication
parameters to obtain various depths and pitches
of the spiral roughening pattern; the depth varied
from 10 to 20 mils and the pitch from 2.6 to 7.6
threads per inch. The tubing collapsed when the

depth exceeded 20 mils. Several tubes are shown
in Fig. 22.9.

We noted that the stringers of M C carbides
cracked during fabrication (Fig. 22.10), and ther-
mal fatigue tests would be needed to determine
whether these cracks propagate during service.
However, the modified Hastelloy N presently
under study does not have these stringers and
should present no problems in this regard.

M. E. Whatley

INTRODUCTION

This has been a period of fulfillment for several
projects in our program. The first fuel charge of
the MSRE was processed for the recovery of the
235U by fluorination in an operation characterized
by simplicity and predictable performance. The
product uranium was decontaminated sufficiently
to allow manual manipulation of the sodium
fluoride beds on which it was accumulated, and
the carrier salt was purified for reuse in the
second phase of the reactor operation. We suc-
cessfully prepared a 233U charge, in the form
of an 7LiF-233UF4 eutectic salt, for refueling
the MSRE; it is now packaged in capsules and
cans, ready for insertion into the reactor. This
preparation proceeded rapidly and with little
difficulty after some revisions in the chemical
flowsheet were made. Our nonradioactive testing

of the 48-liter molten-salt still has been concluded.

We are confident of the feasibility of this operation
and have observed practical distillation rates
(~1.5 ft3 ft—2 day—!) at temperatures of 1000°C
and pressures of 0.1 mm Hg over a period of many
hours. Preparations to perform a distillation

291

experiment with this still at the MSRE, using

MSRE carrier salt, are under way. Our developmental
work on reductive extraction processing of MSBR’s
was fruitful from the standpoint of the accumulation
of basic chemical data which, at least in the case

of the protactinium isolation flowsheet, have

greatly increased our confidence. The distribution
coefficients are still highly attractive, and the
solubility of protactinium has been found to exceed
the necessary 2000 ppm in bismuth.

Our work on contactor development continues to
be encouraging. Facilities for performing engineer-
ing studies on reductive extraction have been
designed, and installation is in progress. Opera-
tions with salt and bismuth are scheduled to
begin during the next few months. The method
for separating rare earths from thorium by reductive
extraction is still in the developmental phases.
Separation factors in the proposed reactor salt
system appear to be somewhat low (between 1
and 3); therefore, it may be necessary to adjust
the concentration of the carrier salt in order to
attain separation factors that will be sufficiently
high to make this operation feasible.
23. Measurement of Distribution Coefficients

in Molten-Salt—Metal Systems

L. M. Ferris

Development of the reductive extraction method
for the processing of single-fluid molten-salt
breeder reactor fuels has been continued. The
process being evaluated involves the selective
extraction of uranium, protactinium, and rare
earths from the molten salt into liquid bismuth
that contains a dissolved reductant such as
thorium. In order to evaluate the feasibility
of large-scale engineering application of this
method, the equilibrium distribution of the
various components between the two phases
must be known. The distribution of component
M can be expressed as a distribution coefficient

mole fraction of component M in metal phase

M

mole fraction of component M in salt phase

Thermodynamic treatment! of the equilibria in-
volved with salts that contain LiF indicates that
the distribution coefficients of the various compo-
nents should be expressible in terms of the fol-
lowing relationship:

logDM:nlogDLi+log1,

in which n is the valence of the component (as its
fluoride MF ) in the salt, and [ is a constant. The
ratio of the distribution coefficients for two compo-
nents (e.g., A and B),

DA/DB =

A-B"’

Rept. Dec. 31, 1966, ORNL~-4076, p. 34.

is called the separation factor. If a - 1, no
separation is possible; the higher the separation
factor, the easier the separation. The purpose

of our program is to obtain distribution coef-
ficients and separation factors for uranium,
protactinium, thorium, rare earths, and other
fission products in various salt-metal systems

so that, ultimately, the best conditions for a
large-scale separation process can be determined.

23.1 EXTRACTION OF PROTACTINIUM
FROM SINGLE-FLUID MSBR FUELS

L. M. Ferris
D. E. Spangler

J. C. Mailen
E. D. Nogueira

During the early part of this reporting period,
an alpha facility was established for use in small-
scale studies of the behavior of protactinium in
reductive extraction systems. The distribution
of protactinium between a typical single-fluid
MSBR fuel salt, LiF-BeF ,-ThF , (69.2-19.4-11.4
mole %), and liquid bismuth has been established
at 600°C. Other experiments have shown that the
solubility of protactinium in bismuth at 600°C
under reductive extraction conditions is at least
2078 ppm, and that protactinium can be maintained
in solution indefinitely in a molybdenum container
if the system is free of oxidants.

The initial experiments were conducted as fol-
lows: Bismuth (200 to 300 g), contained in a
mild-steel crucible, was treated with hydrogen
at 600 to 650°C for about 24 hr and then was
frozen under high-purity batch-analyzed argon.

In a separate vessel, a few milligrams of 23'Pa
and about 1 mc of ?*3Pa were added to the LiF-
293

BeF -ThF , salt. The salt, contained in a degassed
graphite crucible, was treated with HF-H, to
remove oxide impurities and, finally, was treated
with argon to strip out residual HF and hydrogen.
The salt was frozen and the resulting ingot was
transferred under argon to the mild-steel crucible
containing the bismuth. After the two-phase
system had been heated to the desired temperature
under argon, pieces of Li-Bi alloy (about 7 at. %
Li) were added periodically to increase the
reductant concentration in the metal phase.
Filtered samples of both phases were taken either
4 or 24 hr after addition of the alloy. Analyses
of these samples allowed calculation of the
distribution coefficients.

Although the technique outlined above gave
reliable values for the distribution coefficients,
material balances for protactinium, uranium, and
thorium were undesirably low. The main cause
of the low balances was found to be oxidation of
these active metals by oxidants present in the
supposedly high-purity argon. This problem was
eliminated by passing the argon through two traps
filled with uranium turnings; the first trap was
held at 600°C and the second trap was held at
260°C. Experiments made after this modification
were conducted in a system in which the compo-
nents that contacted the salt and bismuth (crucible,
sparge tubes, thermowells, etc.) were all fabricated
from molybdenum. Use of molybdenum allowed
simultaneous HF-H, treatment of the salt and
bismuth. In addition, being able to hydrofluorinate
the two-phase system in molybdenum made it
possible to conduct several experiments in sequence
in the same apparatus, using only one initial charge
of protactinium.

Distribution coefficients for protactinium at
600°C using LiF-BeF -ThF  (69.2-19.4-11.4
mole %) as the salt phase are shown in Fig. 23.1.
The slope of the line is 4, showing that the
protactinium species in the salt phase was
tetravalent. These data yield a value of 0.579 v
for AE[;, the difference in half-cell reduction
potentials as defined by Moulton.? This value,
when compared with previously reported?® values
for uranium and thorium, confirms earlier indica-

U-P

As mentioned above, the protactinium material
balances were low in many of the earlier experi-
ments. Actually, the material balance declined
slowly, but steadily, throughout these experiments.
The primary cause of the decline was oxidation of
protactinium present in the metal phase by oxidants
present in the argon. Experiment PES was con-
ducted at 600°C in molybdenum using argon that
had been passed through traps filled with uranium
turnings, with the objective of demonstrating that
protactinium could be held in bismuth at a signifi-
cant concentration if the system was practically
free of oxidants. In this experiment, UF, and
PaF4 that originally were present in the salt,
LiF-BeF -ThF  (69.2-19.4-11.4 mole %), were
reduced by addition of crystal-bar thorium to the
system. The amount of thorium added was suf-
ficient to reduce all of the UF , and about 95%
of the PaF . The resulting metal phase con-
tained about 5000 ppm U, 750 ppm Th, and 70
ppm Pa; the protactinium concentration in the
salt was about 10 ppm. The system remained
practically unchanged for 128 hr (Table 23.1).
The results of this experiment provide con-
clusive proof that protactinium can be main-
tained in solution with bismuth in a molybdenum
container and that good material balances can
be maintained if oxidants are excluded from the
system.

The feasibility of the proposed protactinium
recovery process? has been subjected to question
because it had not been demonstrated that prot-
actinium was sufficiently soluble in bismuth,
U-Bi, and Th-Bi solutions for process application.
A calculation* of the concentration profiles ex-

294

pected in a reductive extraction contactor indicated

that the solubility of protactinium in bismuth had
to be at least as high as that of thorium, and that
protactinium had to be soluble to about 1000 wt
ppm when the concentrations of uranium or thorium
in the bismuth were about 1000 wt ppm if the
desired process conditions were to be attained.

Rept. Feb. 29, 1968, ORNL-4254, p. 248.

Experiment PE7 was conducted in an attempt to
demonstrate that the desired process conditions
could be met. Using molybdenum apparatus, about
100 mg of *3'Pa was dissolved (as PaF ) in 100
g of LiF-BeF , (66-34 mole %) by hydrofluorination
in the presence of 50 g of bismuth. After hydro-
fluorination, residual HF and hydrogen were re-
moved from the salt by stripping with pure argon.
With the system at 600°C, crystal-bar thorium was
added to the metal phase to reduce some of the
PaF . and effect protactinium transfer to the metal
phase. A sample of the metal phase taken 4 hr
after the addition of thorium analyzed 1124 wt
ppm protactinium and 1400 wt ppm thorium (Table
23.2). This corresponded to reduction of only
about 50% of the PaF ,; addition of another piece
of thorium to the system resulted in transfer of
about 95% of the protactinium to the metal phase.
Subsequent analyses of samples of the metal
phase (Table 23.2, samples 2 and 3) yielded
protactinium concentrations as high as 2078 wt
ppm. Since raising or lowering the temperature
by 50° produced no significant change in the
protactinium concentration in the bismuth (Table
23.2, samples 4, 5, and 7), it was concluded that
the solubility of protactinium in bismuth is at
least 2050 wt ppm at 550°C. When the temperature
was lowered to 500°C the protactinium concentra-
tion in the bismuthdecreased to about 1200 wt ppm
(Table 23.2, sample 6), with a corresponding
decrease in protactinium material balance. Assuming
that the solubility at 500°C is about 1200 wt ppm
and that the apparent heat of solution is about the
same as that of thorium (see Sect. 23.3), the
solubility of protactinium in bismuth at 600°C is

of this writing, analysis of all samples from
experiment PE7 was incomplete. However, based
on those available and on estimates from gamma
counting of the samples, the protactinium balance
was practically 100% throughout the 7.3-day
experiment.

The results obtained so far from experiment
PE7 show that the solubility of protactinium in
bismuth is at least as high as the thorium solubility
in the temperature range of interest. In addition,
the mutual solubility of thorium and protactinium
(at least 1000 wt ppm of each) is adequately high
for process application.

23.2 EXTRACTION OF THORIUM
AND RARE EARTHS FROM SINGLE-FLUID
MSBR FUELS

L. M. Ferris J. J. Lawrance
J. F. Land

Distribution coefficients for thorium and rare
earths are being determined using a variety of
LiF-BeF ,-ThF , salt compositions. In most
experiments the salt and about an equal volume

of bismuth were heated to the desired temperature

in a mild-steel crucible under argon. Then lithium
(as Li-Bi alloy) was added to the bismuth in small
increments, and the distribution of the various
components between the two phases was determined.
Under these experimental conditions, enough ThF
could be reduced to produce a metal phase that
was saturated with thorium without changing the
ThF4 concentration in the salt detectably. Once
saturation was achieved, addition of more reductant
(lithium or, in some cases, crystal-bar thorium)
merely resulted in the precipitation of a thorium
bismuthide, and, consequently, the distribution
coefficients of the various components remained
constant. For a given system the highest possible
distribution coefficients are those obtained when
the metal phase is saturated with thorium and,
accordingly, will be denoted as D™2*, At a given
temperature, D72% is simply the solubility of
thorium in bismuth (atom fraction) divided by the
ThF , concentration in the salt (mole fraction);
thus the value of D?:x depends only on the ’I‘hF4
concentration in the salt and provides a convenient
reference point for the correlation of data. The
separation factors determined at Dm:" will be
denoted by a*, although it should be emphasized
that these are not necessarily the maximum
separation factors attainable. If the valence of
the other component is less than 4, the separation
factor decreases as the thorium concentration in
the metal phase increases, and a* is actually the
lowest value possible. If the valence of the other
component is also 4, the separation factor is a*,
regardless of the thorium concentration in the
metal phase.

Typical plots of log D, vslog D, , using data
from experiments with two different salt composi-
tions are shown in Fig. 23.2. These plots illustrate
several things: (1) The scatter in data points is
typical of experiments of this type; (2) the fact
that the data can be represented in this manner
suggests that many of the assumptions made in
the original thermodynamic treatment’® of the
equilibria involved are reasonably valid (the slopes
of the lines are 2, 3, and 4 for Eu, La, and Th
respectively); (3) since the ThF , concentration in
both salts was about 12 mole %, the same value
of about 1.46 x 10~ 2 for D?ix was obtained in
each experiment. However, since the corresponding
values for Dm?x were markedly different, it is
obvious that the activity of the ThF , and/or the
LiF changed with salt composition. M. A. Bredig

of the Chemistry Division suggested® that these
changes in activity might be related to differences
in what he called the “‘free fluoride’’ equivalence
of the salts. Free fluoride equivalence (FF) is
defined as

FF = LiF (mole %)
- ZZBeF2 (mole %) — 3ThF‘4 (mole %) .

This concept appears to have some validity in that
the values for a* for several rare earths increase
with increasing free fluoride equivalence of the
salt, both at 600 and 700°C (Table 23.3 and Fig.
23.3). The data in Table 23.3 also suggest that
temperature has very little effect on the values

of a*. More experiments of this type are in
progress to better define the relationship between
the separation factor and the free fluoride
equivalence of the salt.

23.3 SOLUBILITY OF THORIUM IN BISMUTH

C. E. Schilling L. M. Ferris

The results of one prior study® indicated that
the solubility of thorium in liquid bismuth at
600°C was about 3000 wt ppm. Since the thorium
concentrations obtained at D™2* in reductive
extraction experiments (see Sect. 23.2) were only
about 2000 wt ppm, direct measurements of the
solubility were made to determine whether the
literature value was high or whether some other
component, for example, lithium, present in the
reductive extraction systems was depressing
the thorium solubility. Measurements were made
in the temperature range 482 to 817°C. The sys-
tem was contained in a mild-steel crucible under
an argon atmosphere. Sufficient crystal-bar thorium
was used to ensure saturation at temperatures as
high as 950°C. Samples of the saturated liquid
were removed for analysis using a variety of
stainless steel vacuum-type filters.

These data are in good agreement with those
reported by Greenwood,” but are lower than

the values given by Hayes and Gordon.® These
solubility data are also in excellent agreement
with the values indicated by reductive extraction
experiments at 600 to 700°C, suggesting that the
presence of lithium, uranium, rare earths, and
other elements in low concentration have no
marked effect on the thorium solubility.

24. Simulated Molten-Salt—Liquid-Bismuth Contactor Studies

J. S. Watson

The proposed method for removing protactinium
and fission products from a single-fluid molten-
salt breeder reactor (or from the blanket salt of
two-fluid reactors) involves reductive extraction
using liquid bismuth containing lithium and thorium
reductants. Equipment is needed to efficiently
contact streams of salt and bismuth. The proper-
ties of these fluids are very different from those
of aqueous and organic fluids with which most
experience with liquid-liquid extraction equipment
has been obtained. For instance, the difference
between the densities of the salt and metal phases
will be between 5.5 and 7.5 g/ml, while aqueous-
organic systems have differences between 0.05
and 0.2 g/ml. Similarly, the interfacial tension
between bismuth and molten salt could be as much
as a factor of 10 greater than that usually seen
In aqueous-organic systems.

Since the correlations used to design liquid-
liquid extraction systems are based upon condi-
tions far removed from those of current interest,
experimental data from systems similar to the
molten-salt—bismuth system are needed. Be-
cause experiments with bismuth and molten salt
are difficult, a mercury-water system will be
used initially to provide the hydrodynamic data
necessary to allow intelligent selection of con-
tactor types to test with the process fluids. This
simulated system will provide quantitative data
on flooding rates, pressure drop, holdup, and back-
mixing, as well as qualitative information on flow
patterns and drop size. Mass transfer measure-
ments are also possible in a simulated system;
however, they are not in progress.

One similar study has been reported. Johnson
and co-workers! at Argonne studied a column

packed with % -in. Berl saddles, using water and
Wood’s metal. Their observed flooding rates were
not adequately predicted by conventional correla-
tions. Actually, when the correlations were ex-
trapolated to the required conditions, the predicted
results were so different that it was considered a
coincidence when a predicted flooding rate fell
near the experimental value.

The experiments in this study are carried out
in a 1-in.-ID, 2-ft-long glass column. Mercury is
circulated between the column and a hold tank by
a diaphragm pump containing tantalum check
values. Distilled water is circulated through the
column by a small centrifugal pump. Ball valves
are located at each end of the 1-in. column and
allow flow to and from the column to be stopped
instantly for holdup measurements. Each end of
the column also contains a section of 2-in. pipe.
These sections, which are partially packed with
the packing material of interest, allow lower
velocities for coalescence, as well as provide
space for the inlet and outlet lines.

Thus far we have tested Teflon Raschig rings
(3’/1 ¢ and 1/4 in. OD) and a solid cylindrical packing
%, in. in diameter and 7, in. long. (The column
diameter should be about twice as large to avoid
wall effects with %-in. packing, but we are, at
present, restricted to the smaller diameter because
of the limited capacity of the mercury pump.) Tef-
lon and polyethylene will be chosen for most
packing materials because they are not wet by
either phase, and neither bismuth nor the molten
fluoride salt is expected to wet the material
chosen for the process contactor.

There are apparently two different flow condi-
tions under which the column can operate. These
are illustrated in Figs. 24.1 and 24.2. Figure 24.1
shows a photograph of the column packed with
% -in. Raschig rings through which the metal

travels downward in channels. This type of be-
havior is typical for all flow rates tested with this
packing. Figure 24.2 is a photograph of the column
with ¥ -in. Raschig rings. This small increase in
packing diameter causes a dramatic change in the
behavior of the dispersed metal phase. The metal
moves down the column in the form of small drop-
lets which seldom coalesce and remain intact for
considerable distances down the column. This

flow behavior is typical of all measurements made
with the 1/4-in. Raschig rings or the 1/4-in. solid
cylinder packing. However, as the flow rates ap-
proach flooding conditions, some ‘‘channel”’ flow
begins to occur. The dispersed or droplet flow is
more desirable, since it provides a significantly
greater interfacial area than ‘‘channel’’ flow.
Thus it may be desirable to operate the salt-metal
columns with approximately 1/4-in. or larger packing.
With 3/1 -in. Raschig rings and 1/4-in. solid cylin-
ders, flooding occurred at approximately the same
conditions. At equal (volumetric) flow rates,
flooding occurred when the superficial velocity of
each phase reached approximately 90 ft/hr or 650
gal ft—2 hr— !, We investigated flooding rates for
a range of flow ratios. The flooding curves could

be approximated by means of straight lines with

near-unity negative slopes when the square roots
of the two phase velocities were plotted against
each other.

The 1/4—in. Raschig rings gave considerably
higher flooding rates. At equal flow rates, flood-
ing did not occur until the superficial velocity of
each phase reached approximately 190 ft/hr.

Efforts are also being made to correlate holdup,
pressure drop, and flooding rates with all of the
systems studied. The simulated system should
provide methods for interpreting and understanding
the pressure drop measurements which will be made
with salt-metal contactors; in addition, it should
provide initial estimates of how such contactors
will behave.
25. Reductive Extraction Engineering Studies

H. D. Cochran, ]Jr.

B. A. Hannaford
W. F. Shaffer

E. L. Youngblood

Equipment has been designed and fabricated for
semicontinuous engineering experiments on reduc-
tive extraction. Mass transfer between molten
salt and bismuth streams will be observed under
various flow conditions. Pressure drop through
the column can also be measured, and it may be
possible to correlate mass transfer performance
with hydrodynamic conditions ~ flooding, holdup,
specific interfacial area, etc. — which may be
inferred from work under way using a mercury-
water system. The first experiments are planned
for the last quarter of 1968 and will involve trans-
fer of uranium from a salt to a metal stream.

Molten salt and liquid bismuth will be contacted
countercurrently in a packed column 0.82 in. ID x
2 ft long filled with 1/4-in. right circular cylinders
of molybdenum. Three other columns having similar
dimensions — one containing 1/g-in. cylindrical
packing, one with segmental baffles at % -in.
spacing, and one empty column — are also available
for testing. Approximately 15-liter batches of
molten salt and bismuth will be charged initially
to a graphite crucible in the treatment vessel,
where oxidation will be effected by sparging with
HF-Hz. The two fluids will then be transferred by

301

argon pressurization to separate feed tanks, and
reductant (metallic lithium) will be added to the
bismuth feed tank. From the feed tanks, salt and
metal will be transferred by argon pressure at comn
trolled rates (up to about 0.5 liter/min) through
the extraction column to separate catch tanks.

All tanks are equipped with sampling stations,
and both product streams can be sampled during
operation. To begin the next experiment, salt

and metal will be transferred back to the treat-
ment vessel for oxidation. An electrolytic cell

for oxidation and reduction of species present in
the salt-metal system may also be tested; it will
be connected in parallel with the extraction
column. The cell will not be used during reductive
extraction experiments.

This study will also provide an opportunity to
test equipment design and to reveal the problems
inherent in processing salt continuously on a
large scale. Some of these problems involve
entrainment, performance of freeze valves with a
possible second phase entrained in the major
phase, and compatibility of materials with the
salt-bismuth mixture.
26. Continuous Fluorination of Molten Salt

B. A. Hannaford

Equipment is being developed for the continuous
removal of UF , from a salt stream by countercur-
rently contacting the salt with F_ in a salt-phase-
continuous system. The equipment will be pro-
tected from corrosion by freezing a layer of salt
on the vessel wall; the heat necessary for main-
taining molten salt adjacent to frozen salt will be
provided by the decay of fission products in the
salt stream. In a series of recently concluded ex-
periments using countercurrent flow of salt and an
inert gas, we demonstrated that a frozen salt layer
can be formed and maintained at conditions of fluid
flow and heat transfer which approximate those ex-
pected for processing fuel from a 1000-Mw (electri-
cal) MSBR.

The experimental equipment, described pre-
viously,! consisted of a 5-in.-diam 8-ft-high
column fabricated from sched-40 nickel pipe. An
internal heat source consistingof three Calrod
heaters contained in a 34 -in.-diam sched-40 pipe
was used to simulate a volume heat source in the
molten salt. The salt mixture was 66-34 mole %
LiF-ZrF , which has a liquidus temperature of
595°C and a phase diagram similar to the LiF-
BeF system. Since the principal objective of the
work was to demonstrate that a uniform layer of
frozen salt could be established and maintained at
expected heat generation rates, we chose to sub-
stitute argon for fluorine, thereby simplifying the
experimental procedures.

For the final set of experiments, the insulation
was stripped from the upper test section, and the
air cooling coils were removed to permit heat loss
by radiation and natural convection. The primary
purpose was to obtain more nearly uniform surface

temperature and frozen salt thickness throughout
the test section.

As a means of confirming the frozen salt thick-
ness indicated by the internal thermocouples, the
molten salt phase in a few selected experiments
was quickly drained from the column after a period
of steady-state operation. Radiographs of the
columnwere then made; one of these (Fig. 26.1)
shows that over the 3.5-in. elevation change
covered by the array of internal thermocouples,
the salt thickness decreased from 0.80 to 0.65
in. The 0.80-in. thickness of the salt layer in the
plane of the nominal 1/2-in.-deep thermocouple,
as determined from the radiograph, was in good
agreement with the salt thickness determined from
temperature measurements. This method is illus-
trated in Fig. 26.2 for the same experiment and is
based on the temperature-position relationship for
the classical case of purely radial flow of heat
to the outer surface of a thick-walled cylinder.
Here thecylinder was the frozen salt layer itself;
the metal wall constituted a negligible resistance
to heat flow because of its much higher coefficient
of thermal conductivity. The most consistent
interpretation of the experimental data was ob-
tained by using only two thermocouples — the
internal thermocouple located 0.66 in. from the
metal wall, and the adjacent wall thermocouple —
to locate the interface. The intended use of the
entire array of internal thermocouples was not
feasible for a number of reasons. (1) The embedded
thermocouple nearest the interface (usually thermo-
couple C, nominally 3/4 in. deep) caused a local
perturbation of the interface. This was observed
in radiographs and in the postoperation examina-
tion. (2) The tip of the thermocouple nearest the
wall appeared to have changed position during the
course of the experiments. (3) Surface temperatures

varied axially over the length of the thermocouple
array.

Following the final experiment the upper test
section was sawed into sections to permit visual
examination of the frozen salt layer and direct
measurement of internal thermocouple locations
(Fig. 26.3). The salt thickness was very uniform
over the central portion of this test section. Two
separate frozen salt layers were observed; these
are more clearly discernible in Fig. 26.4. The
inner, dark layer was apparently deposited during
the approximately 1-hr period required to drain
molten salt from the column after the Calrod
heaters were turned off. The low drain rate was
caused by a porous metal deposit in the drain line
which limited the salt flow rate during the latter
runs to =3 liters/hr. The outer bank was the
layer of frozen salt that existed at steady state.

The thickness was essentially uniform around the
entire circumference.

The concentricity of the frozen layer throughout
approximately a 30-in. length of the upper test
section indicated that the off-axis feed point for
the argon caused no undesirable effects on the
uniformity of the frozen layer thickness.

The inferred thickness of frozen salt for the
series of 24 experiments ranged from about 0.10
to 1.10 in. The equivalent volume heat generation
rate ranged from 34,000 to 190,000 Bty hr—! ft—3.
For most experiments the rate was intentionally
set higher than the reference value of 50,000 Btu
hr=! ft—3 because of a tendency for the salt to
freeze completely across the column at low heat
generation rates. This maloperation may be largely
explained by the nonuniform nature of the cooling
method used (air cooling coils).

27. Distillation of MSRE Fuel Carrier Salt

J. R. Hightower

The nonradioactive phase of the MSRE distilla-
tion experiment was completed on June 18, 1968,
and installation of equipment has been started at
the MSRE for distillation of a 48-liter batch of
fluorinated fuel salt from the reactor. This non-
radioactive phase of the experiment involved dis-
tilling six 48-liter batches of MSRE fuel carrier
salt (four of which contained 0.1 to 0.3 mole %
NdF.). During these runs, vaporization rates
were measured, and samples of the condensate
were taken to assess the effect of concentration
polarization and entrainment on operation of the
equipment.

Essentially the same procedure was used in each
run. Molten salt was charged to the feed tank at
600°C from a heated storage vessel. After the
storage vessel was disconnected, the still pot
was heated to 900 to 950°C, and the system pres-
sure was reduced to 5 mm Hg. The feed tank was
pressurized to about 0.5 atm to force salt into the
still pot, and the condenser pressure was de-
creased to 0.05 to 0.1 mm Hg to initiate vaporiza-
tion at an appreciable rate. At this time the
liquid level in the still pot was switched to
automatic control, and salt was fed to the still
pot in this mode at a rate slightly greater than
the vaporization rate. The argon feed valve to the
feed tank remained open (forcing more salt into the
still pot) until the liquid level in the still pot rose
to a given point; the valve then remained closed
until the salt dropped to another set point. After
about one still volume had been processed, the
temperature of the still was raised to the desired
operating point (approximately 1000°C). When the
desired quantity of salt had been distilled, distil-
lation was stopped by increasing the condenser
pressure to 5 mm Hg. Then 8 to 10 liters of the
initial salt mixture was used to flush the high-
melting salt from the still pot and to produce a

306

L. E. McNeese

salt mixture in the still having a liquidus tempera-
ture of less than 700°C,

During each run, distillation rates were de-
termined by measuring the rate of rise of the con-
densate level in the receiver. The steady-state
rate measurements for each run and the operating
conditions under which they were determined are
shown in Table 27.1.

Under the operating conditions in the still the
distillation rate is controlled by the condition
that the frictional pressure loss through the passage
connecting the vaporization and condensation sur-
faces equals the difference between the vapor
pressure of the salt in the still pot and the pressure
at the lower end of the condenser. With condenser.
pressures much lower than the salt vapor pressure
(~ 1.0 mm Hg at 1000°C), the distillation rate

should vary directly as the salt vapor pressure

and hence be quite dependent on still pot tempera-
ture. For the runs in which the condenser pressure
is below 0.1 mm Hg, the effect of still tempera-
ture is shown in Fig. 27.1. The observed distilla-
tion rates (approximately 1.5 ft® of salt per day
per square foot of vaporization surface) would be
acceptable in a processing plant.

Concentration polarization in the still pot or
entrainment of liquid droplets from the still pot
could seriously limit the separation of the slightly
volatile LnF  from the more volatile LiF and
BeF,. The extent of polarization or entrainment
was determined by analyzing condensate samples
taken during the course of a run for NdFs. The
ratio of NdF, concentration in the condensate to
the average NdF3 concentration in the still, de-
noted by R, should be constant and should ap-
proximate the relative volatility of NdF, with
respect to LiF.

In the first run in which NdF_ was included in
the feed salt, R varied (randomly) between 1.4 x
10~ % and 3.5 x 10~ for about 2.5 still pot volumes
of collected condensate. This value is comparable
with the measured relative volatility of NdF,
which is 1.4 x 107%.! In later runs (MSS-C-5 and
MSS-C-6) the values of R were as high as 5.5 x
10—2; however, it is believed that the high values

were the result of samples contaminated by flush
salt from previous runs remaining on the con-
denser walls and in the sample reservoir. Neither
concentration polarization nor entrainment was
evident in the run from which data are considered
most reliable.

Two difficulties were encountered: (1) con-
densed ZrF, and unidentified molybdenum com-
pounds in the vacuum line completely restricted
flow on two occasions, and (2) a deposition of
nickel and iron in the salt feed line to the still
almost stopped the flow after the first two runs
and caused a noticeable restriction in the replace-
ment feed line after the fourth run.

The major metallic constituents of the plugs in
the vacuum line were zirconium and molybdenum.
The first plug was removed by cutting into the
vacuum line; the second plug was broken during
the last run by heating the vacuum line to about
950 to 1050°C, thereby redistributing the material.
Examination of the vacuum line during the post-
operational inspection showed that the free cross
section of the pipe at the point of exit from the
receiver was still about 50% of the original cross
section. Analysis of the material obstructing the
vacuum line showed it to contain 39.4% zirconium
and 11.6% molybdenum, with F~ and O?~ as the
major anions.

The cause for the metal deposition in the salt
feed line is not completely understood. Two pos-
sible sources of the deposited material are sus-
pended metals and/or dissolved fluorides intro-
duced with the feed salt, and corrosion products.
The possibility that system corrosion may have
been a factor is suggested by the composition of
the deposits, ~0.9 wt % Co and 0.7 to 2 wt % Mo
(both of these metals are constituents of Hastelloy
N), and of the plug in the vacuum line (high molyb-
denum content). The extent of corrosion neces-
sary to produce the materials found would be very
small and could not have been detected by the
wall thickness measurements. Another possible
source of corrosion products is the corrosion
coupons in the still pot, although no coupon was
severely corroded. A hypothesis for reduction and

by the Transpiration Method

F. J. Smith C. T. Thompson
L. M. Ferris
Liquid-vapor equilibrium data for a number of where a _ is the relative volatility of A with

LiF-BeF -ThF, systems have been obtained by
the transpiration method in support of possible
distillation steps in the processing of single-fluid
Molten-Salt Breeder Reactor fuels. The data are
summarized in Table 28.1. In the absence of any
information regarding complex molecules in the
vapor phase, the partial pressures and the pre-
dicted total pressures were calculated by assum-
ing that only monomers existed in the vapor. As-
sociation in the vapor (known to occur in the
vapor above pure LiF and LiF-BeF, systems)
would lower both the calculated partial pressures
and the predicted total pressures. In all cases
the apparent partial pressure P could be described
adequately by a linear equation,

log P (mm Hg) =4 — B/T(°K) ,

in which A and B are constants over the tempera-
ture range (950 to 1050°C) investigated. Rela-
tive volatilities, as well as effective activity
coefficients, are also included. For a multicom-
ponent system the activity coefficients of com-
ponent A at each temperature are given by

Ya=Pu/N, Pa
where N . is the mole fraction of A in the melt,

and p,?a is the vapor pressure of pure A. Relative
volatility is defined by

YT,

309

respect to B, Y is the mole fraction of the desig-
nated component in the vapor phase, and X is the
mole fraction in the liquid phase. _

In addition to the systems shown in Table 28.1,
a limited amount of data was obtained with LiF-
BeFZ-ThF4-solute fluoride systems. Data for the
system LiF-BeF -ThF ,-LaF, (36.6-1.0-59.6-2.8
mole %) indicate the following relative volatilities
with respect to LiF at 1000°C: BeF,, 37; ThF,,
0.25; LaF,, <0.0015. Data for the system LiF-
BeF -ThF,-CsF-RbF (33-0.66-63-1.36-1.98 mole
%) yielded relative volatilities of about 100, 0.65,
3.7, and 1.0 for BeF,, ThF,, CsF, and RbF, re-
spectively, at 1000°C. The total pressure pre-
dicted for this system is less than 0.05 mm Hg
at 1000°C. In an experiment in which CsF and
RbF were presentin LiF-BeF, -ThF, (68-20-12
mole %) at concentrations of 0.13 and 0.08 mole
%, respectively, relative volatilities of 107 for
CsF and 119 for RbF were obtained at 1000°C.
Data from a run with LiF-BeF -ThF ,-EuF (42.4-
0.06-51.8-5.8 mole %) yielded a relative volatility
of <0.009 for EuF, at 1000°C.

The results of these studies show that, since
the volatilities of both the rare earths and ThF,
are low, distillation is probably not applicable as
a primary separations method in the processing
of single-fluid MSBR fuels. Distillation might,
however, find application as a concentration-
adjustment step in connection with a reductive
extraction process.

The MSRE is to be fueled with 233U in 1968.
Approximately 39.0 kg of 91.4% enriched 233U as
"LiF-%3%UF, (73-27 mole %) eutectic salt is re-
quired. This material was prepared in cell G of
the Thorium Uranium Recycle Facility because of
the high 232U content (222 ppm) of the feed
material and its associated radiation.

The process and equipment for preparing this
concentrate have been described previously.! This
report describes the cold run using 238U, changes
in the process as a result of the cold run experi-
ence, and the production of the enriching concen-
trate.

29.1 COLD SHAKEDOWN RUN

The cold run was completed April 12, 1968,
using the one-step high-temperature process and
equipment shown schematically in Fig. 29.1. Sev-
eral operational difficulties were encountered.
The end point of the hydrofluorination step of the
process was difficult to determine because our
sampling procedure was contributing oxide con-
tamination to the melt. We modified the procedures
and some of our equipment so that we would take
a dipped sample of the melt for oxide determina-
tion and later take filtered samples for analysis of
the corrosion products, primarily iron, nickel, and
chromium, after the hydrogen purification of the
eutectic., This method of sampling was used for

the remainder of the cold run and throughout the
2330 production operations.

The cold run product met the quality criteria
established by the MSRE, but the prolonged opera-
tion at elevated temperatures and some of the
sample data taken during the run indicated ex-
cessive corrosion of the reaction vessel. Upon
completion of the run the vessel was sectioned,
and extensive damage to the nickel liner was
noted.

29.2. PRODUCTION OF THE 7LiF-233UF4
CONCENTRATE

Because of the difficulties encountered in the
cold run, a low-temperature, two-step flowsheet
was investigated in a laboratory experiment.

Two hundred grams of normal uranium, as UO_, was

first reduced by hydrogen sparging and then ceé)n-
verted to UF | by hydrofluorination at temperatures
200 to 400°C lower than in the original flowsheet.
This technique was then adopted for the production
of the fuel concentrate.

The first 233U production run with the revised
process flowsheet (Fig. 29.2) began May 9, 1968.
Uranium oxide was treated initially at 500°C with
a helium sparge to remove any volatiles and to
thoroughly decompose remaining ammonium com-
pounds. The UO3 was then reduced to U0, over
a period of 24 hr by sparging with hydrogen at
concentrations from 5 to 100% over the temperature
range 400 to 550°C. Five days were required to
convert the UO, to UF, by hydrofluorination with
a mixture of 40% anhydrous hydrogen fluoride in
hydrogen at temperatures ranging from 400 to

100% for the first four days of this treatment but
then rapidly dropped to zero on the fifth day as
the reaction went to completion.

The temperatures within the powder bed were
monitored throughout the uranium reduction and
hydrofluorination by a multithermocouple probe
inserted along the vertical axis of the reaction
vessel. Twelve thermocouples were located at
2-in. intervals along the probe. The progress of
the exothermic reactions upward through the bed
could very easily be followed by observing the
temperature profile. The data for the uranium re-
duction and hydrofluorination are presented graph-
ically in Figs. 29.3 and 29.4.

The eutectic salt LiF-UF, (73-27 mole %) was
formed by adding the stoichiometric amount of
’LiF to the 2*3UF, and then melting and digesting
the resulting mixture for 4 hr at 850°C with a
sparge of 30% hydrogen in helium. The melt was
then cooled to 700°C and purged for 24 hr with a

313

mixture of 20% HF in hydrogen to ensure conversion

of any remaining oxides to fluorides. This was
followed by hydrogen treatment for 75 to 100 hr to
reduce the corrosion product fluorides of nickel

and iron to the metallic state so that they could
be removed by filtration.
The reaction

MF + H,—> M° + HF

was monitored by measurement of the HF evolved
with an in-cell titration apparatus. For a 22-kg
eutectic salt charge in the 7% -in.-diam reaction
vessel, hydrogen and helium, each at the rate of
1 liter/min, were bubbled through the melt. Re-
action rates from 0.30 to 0.06 meq/min were ob-
served in reducing the nickel and iron to 50 and
100 ppm respectively. The corrosion product con-
centrations for all production runs are listed in
Table 29.1. Figure 29.5 is a typical plot of the
HF evolution rate during the eutectic purification
step.

29.3 PACKAGING OF THE CONCENTRATE

The fuel concentrate was packaged into 45 en-
richment capsules and 10 shipping containers of
various sizes to accommodate the reactor enrich-
ment schedule.

The array consists of three decks of 15 capsules
which must be separated and the excess connect-

then drilled in each capsule, the bottom hole for
draining and the top hole for venting. The cap-
sules are then weighed and stored in a ‘‘six-pack’’
carousel for shipment to the MSRE. They will be
lowered, one at a time, into the bowl of the reactor
fuel circulating pump, where the fuel concentrate
is melted out.

The ten shipping containers were fabricated
from 2% -in.-OD type 304L stainless steel tubing
of varying lengths, having capacities from 0.5 to
7.0 kg of total uranium. They were assembled into
two arrays for filling. One array (Fig. 29.7) con-
sisted of four containers, each having a uranium
capacity of 7 kg, and the other array (Fig. 29.8)
consisted of six containers varying in capacity
from 0.5 to 3.0 kg of uranium. The product can
assemblies were dismantled, a lifting fixture was
attached to each can, and each can was weighed.
They will be shipped individually in a shielded
cask to the MSRE for loading into the reactor
drain tank.

30. Development of the Two-Step Process for Preparation

of 7LiF-233UF4 Fuel Concentrate for the MSRE

G. I. Cathers
C. J. Shipman

The two-step low-temperature process flowsheet
adopted for preparation of "LiF-233UF  eutectic
salt was developed to replace the high-temperature
one-step process! (found to be intractable in shake-
down runs) with the view of avoiding extensive
engineering changes in the equipment installed in
the 233U production facility. The basis for con-
sideration of a low-temperature process in the 8-
in.-OD nickel production reactor was available in
the literature.?

The important factors to be considered in de-
velopment of a new process were (1) avoidance of
high-temperature local reaction zones in the 8-in.-
OD reactor, and (2) addition of 7LiF to the reactor
after conversion of the UO3 to UF, was practically
complete. The data in the literature indicated that
high-surface-area UO, could be converted to UF,
in the 400 to 600°C range if the temperature and
gas flow rates were carefully controlled.

The basic steps envisioned for the new process
were:

1. Reduction of UO3 to UQ, by hydrogen at ap-
proximately 400 to 600°C.

2. Conversion of UOQ, to UF, with a gaseous HF-
H, mixture at 400 to 650°C.

3. Addition of LiF to the UF, at room tempera-
ture, followed by increasing the temperature to

30.1 LABORATORY TESTOF
LOW-TEMPERATURE PROCESS

A 2-in.-OD by 10-in.-high nickel reactor was
used to test the low-temperature process concept.
A center thermocouple well permitted temperature
measurements at any depth in the reacting powder,
including the zone near the end of the dip tube
which extended down to within 0.25 in. of the
bottom of the reactor. A gas flow rate of 130
ml/min (STP) was employed in all gas addition
steps to simulate the linear velocity (2 std liters/
min) in the 8-in.-OD reactor. The reactor was
charged with 210 g of UO, that was prepared by
decomposition of ammonium diuranate followed by
calcination at a maximum temperature of 550°C.
The preparation of this material was essentially
the same as that for the 233U oxide. The bulk
density (approximately 1.02) of the oxide used in
the laboratory test was similar to that of the 233U
oxide.

Dilution of hydrogen with helium in the reduc-
tion step and of HF with hydrogen in the hydro-
fluorination step were essential features of the
proposed process in order to minimize any tempera-
ture excursions. Although the heat of reaction in
the hydrofluorination step is almost twice that in

Process in a 2-in.-OD Reactor.

the reduction step, the laboratory test demonstrated

that the latter had possibly more potential for the
generation of high excursion temperatures.

A plot of maximum temperature and hydrogen
utilization in the reduction step is given in Fig.
30.1. The test was started at 400°C with 10%
H,-90% He; then the hydrogen concentration was
slowly raised to 100%. A temperature excursion
of about 65°C occurred briefly, but the reaction
subsided as the reaction zone became broader and
the more highly reactive sites disappeared. A
subsequent reduction period with pure H, resulted
in no further significant temperature excursions
even though the furnace set-point temperature
was raised to about 500°C.

The hydrofluorination reaction was carried out
using the same cautious approach. However, this
proved to be unnecessary, since no temperature
excursion of more than 10°C was detected by the
internal thermocouple well (as compared with the

external wall temperature). The initial HF con-
centration of 10% (in hydrogen) was raised to
about 40% in about 6 hr. The total hydrofluorina-
tion period was 24.3 hr. The HF utilization de-
creased from 100% initially to about S5% in the
final 5-hr period. An HF concentration of 40% was
used to maximize the HF input rate while, at the
same time, sufficient hydrogen was added to pre-
vent corrosion of the nickel reactor.

In the third step of the process, 48 g of LiF
powder was placed in the reactor on top of the
UF,, and the temperature was raised to about
875°C (at the bottom of the LiF layer) before
eutectic melting was observed. The lack of
eutectic formation at the eutectic temperature of
490°C was attributed to the lack of mixing of the
LiF and UF, and the short time employed (less
than 2 hr).

The fourth part of the process (hydrofluorination
of the melt) was carried out by using 20% HF—-80%
320

H, for approximately 3 hr at 700°C. The fifth part
of the process was omitted, since the validity of
this step was in little doubt.

30.2 PHYSICAL BEHAVIOR OF POWDER BEDS

In conducting the laboratory test of the process,
care was taken to observe the behavior of the oxide
and fluoride materials in the presence of flowing
gases. This allowed us to anticipate, if possible,
any problems that might arise in operation of the
8-in.-OD reactor in the engineering facility.

The gas flow rate of 130 ml/min (STP) was con-
servatively low, since some suspicion existed
that 4 std liters/min (twice the linear velocity
prevailing in the laboratory test) in the 8-in.-OD
reactor had produced some dust entrainment in the
cold practice run with the first process flowsheet.
During the entire laboratory test, practically no
solids (less than 0.1 g) were entrained from the
reactor to the 2-in.-diam Huyck Feltmetal nickel
filter (equivalent to FM 235, a 7-u-rated material)
placed in the off-gas system.

Tests in glass columns confirmed that the
permeation of gas through the test UO, at the
chosen flow rate was uniform; no channeling was
noted. The small bed expansion which occurred
was correlated with measurements of bed height
and pressure drops in order to predict, with some
accuracy, the behavior of the 25- to 30-in. depth
of powder expected in the 8-in.-OD reactor. The
density increased during the laboratory test from
1.02 to approximately 1.3 at the end of the hydro-
fluorination period.

30.3 OXIDE IMPURITY LEVEL IN PRODUCT

Analysis of the UF  after the dry hydrofluorina-
tion step showed an oxygen content of 0.52%.
The utilization of HF in the hydrofluorination
step indicated that the UF, had contained 0.17%
oxygen. The first analysis was considered more
accurate, however, due to the uncertainty in
integrating the HF utilization over the treatment
period.

Analyses of the final eutectic salt by the hydro-
fluorination and the KBrF, methods gave 348 and

330 ppm of oxygen respectively. Lower values
would probably have been obtained if the salt had
not been accidentally exposed to air before it was
completely cooled.

30.4 FEASIBILITY OF USE OF THE
TWO-STEP PROCESS

The results of the laboratory test indicated the
feasibility of using the process for the preparation
of 233U-containing eutectic salt. Observations
made in this test led to the following conclusions
and recommendations:

1. Good control of both the reduction and hydro-
fluorination steps of the process could be
achieved in the 8-in.-OD production reactor if
the initial temperature was no higher than 440°C
and if the lowest possible reactant gas con-
centrations were used. As the solid reactant
(UO, in the reduction step and UO, in the
hydrofluorination step) is partially reacted and
the more reactive material disappears, the re-
action zone becomes longer, and it is there-
fore possible to increase the temperature and
the gas reactant concentration. The safest
procedure would probably be to increase the
gas reactant concentration as much as possible
before increasing the temperature.

2. In order to control the process on a large
scale, a stack of thermocouples placed near
the center line of the 8-in. reactor would be
desirable. These thermocouples, spaced at
intervals of 2 to 3 in., would permit observa-
tion of movement of the reaction zone upward
during processing and of the maximum tempera-
tures produced.

3. Thermochemical calculations showed that con-
siderable reaction heat was lost through the
reactor side wall in the test of the 2-in. re-
actor. On a larger scale, however, the thermo-
chemical heat would have to be dissipated
mainly in heating of the gas streams.

4. The high utilization of hydrogen in part of the
reduction step, and of HF in the hydrofluorina-
tion step of the laboratory test, indicated that
nearly quantitative usage of reactant gases
could be expected in a scale-up of the process
where a deep bed of material would be employed.
31. Process Development on the Recovery
of Uranium from MSRE

G. I. Cathers

M. R. Bennett

C. J. Shipman

The processing of the MSRE fuel salt used for
the first phase of MSRE operation is described
in the first part of this report. The two objectives
have been satisfactorily achieved: recovering the
235U and purifying the carrier salt, "LiF-BeF -
ZrF, (65-30-5 mole %), for reuse with 233U. The
work described in this section was carried out in
support of the uranium recovery operation.

A study was made of the interdependence of
several factors in the fluorination step in an
effort to anticipate the effect of removing about
220 kg of uranium from 4500 kg of carrier salt.
Particular attention was given to determination of
the uranium valence in the salt as fluorine gas
was introduced and to the relationship of the
uranium valence to helium sparging, temperature,
and corrosion. Two studies were made of the be-
havior of UF (generated in sparging the melt with
fluorine) in the presence of NaF. In the step
following fluorination of the MSRE salt, an NaF
bed at 400°C was used for decontaminating the
gaseous UF from volatile fission products
(principally ruthenium and niobium) and chromium.
Retention of UF, on NaF at 400°C is high (by
decomposition to a UF complex) in the absence
of free fluorine. Tests were made at different
Fz/UF6 ratios to determine whether this causes
serious problems in MSRE processing and to ex-
plore the possibility of the existence of some type
of equilibrium. In the other NaF study, the sorp-
tion of UF, on NaF in the range 25 to 100°C was
examined, particularly with respect to use of low-

or high-surface-area NaF prepared by two distinctly

different methods.

The disposal of waste gaseous fluorine from
MSRE processing was also found to be a problem
area in the startup operation of the installed
facility. The SO, method for the disposal of
fluorine (by the formation of SO F ) was found to
be infeasible under the prevailing conditions. An,
aqueous scrub of KOH-KI-K B, O, was developed
as an alternative method for fluorine disposal in
the MSRE processing plant.

31.1 FLUORINATION-VALENCE STATE STUDY

MSRE salt fluorination tests were made in 1.87-
in.-ID reactors constructed of nickel 200 under
conditions approximating those expected in the
49-in.-ID fluorination reactor at the MSRE site.

A gas flow rate of 146 ml/min (STP) was used to
simulate a flow rate of 100 std liters/min in the
49-in.-ID reactor. Sampling of the salt without
interruption of the fluorination procedure was
achieved by taking a quick-freeze sample with a
1/S-in. nickel rod inserted through a tee at the top
of the reactor. The valence of uranium in the
salt samples was calculated from separate de-
terminations of the U(IV) and U(VI) concentration.
The tests were made with 340 g of LiF-Ber-
ZrF,-UF, (63-32-5-0.8 mole %); the salt depth
was about 3 in.

A test at 500°C with pure fluorine illustrated
the relationship between the degree of uranium
volatilization and the uranium valence in the salt
(Fig. 31.1). Some UF_ was observed to evolve
when the uranium valence in the salt was as low

as 4.1. At 500°C there was an extensive evolu-

tion of UFs as the valence increased from 4 to
5. The valence cantinued to increase (from 5

6.5

toward 6) as the remaining part of the uranium
volatilized. The fact that an intermediate

stable species of U(V) was formed is indicated
from the curve inflection; however, in this case

the volatilization of UF, was too rapid for this
intermediate equilibrium species U(V) to be clearly
seen.

In another test at a lower temperature (450°C),
the valence plot shows a definite inflection at
about the value of five (Fig. 31.2). In this test
the fluorine flow was stopped and helium sparging
was started after 1 hr to determine whether helium
sparging or corrosion would lead to a rapid de-
crease of the uranium valence from 5 to 4. Such
a decrease might be expected from one of the two
following reactions:

2UF, — UF, + UF, , (D

2UF, + Ni — 2UF, + NiF, . (2)
Surprisingly, in the 1.5-hr helium sparging period
there was no significant effect on the valence.

When fluorine flow was resumed the same rapid

UF6 evolution and valence increase occurred as

in the test at 500°C. However, it was clear that

the valence plot of the 450°C data would have had
a much large inflection, even in the absence of a
helium sparge period, than the plot of the 500°C
data.

Stability of U(V) Species During He Sparging.
323

The implications of these results to MSRE salt
processing operations were believed to be signifi-
cant. The main conclusions can be summarized
as follows:

1. The depth of salt in the MSRE fluorination re-
actor (5 to 6 ft) will probably result in the con-
version of all of the uranium to the U(V)
species before any significant UF, volatiliza-
tion takes place. The results, however, do
not lead to any conclusion about fluorine
utilization. The latter might be more critically
dependent on fluorination temperature than on
the depth of salt.

2. Interruption of the fluorination procedure in
MSRE processing for the changing of NaF
sorption beds (as they become loaded with
UFe) should not lead to any difficulty in re-
suming fluorine gas flow. Volatilization of
UF should resume almost immediately after
such an interruption due to the stability of the
U(V) species during the shutdown period.
During this period, however, it would probably
be best to avoid extensive sparging with helium
in order to minimize the evolution of UF, by
disproportionation reaction (1).

3. The stability of the U(V) species is of particular
interest to the corrosion picture. The dotted
line in Fig. 31.2 represents the rate of valence
change expected if the corrosion reaction (2)
should occur at a rate equivalent to 0.67 mil/ hr.
The fact that the valence did not decrease sug-
gests that corrosion will not be a problem dur-
ing the shutdown periods required for the
changing of sorption beds. Possibly total cor-
rosion during the processing of MSRE fuel will
be less than expected if the wall of the re-
actor is in contact with salt containing only
U(V); that is, corrosion should be high only in
the central salt volume where UF is “‘boiling
out’’ as it is formed and where the valence of
the uranium possibly becomes much greater
than 5. The latter applies to the boundary salt
layer surrounding the F_-UF  gas that rises
through the salt.

31.2 EQUILIBRIUM OF UF ; WITH NaF AT
400°C; RETENTION OF URANIUM

In the volatilization of uranium from MSRE salt,
decontamination of the product UF -F -He gas
stream is to be accomplished by passage through

a 400°C NaF trap to remove volatile fission prod-
uct fluorides (mainly RuF, and NbF). During
this phase of the processing, it is necessary to
have some free fluorine gas in the stream to pre-
vent appreciable loss of uranium to the NaF by
disproportionation of UF  to nonvolatile UF..
Since the utilization of fluorine in the early part
of the fluorination might be high, there was con-
cern as to whether sufficient fluorine would be
available to prevent disproportionation and uranium
loss. Therefore, a study was undertaken to de-
termine the validity of an equilibrium condition
for the reaction UF, . NaF + 1/2 F, = UF, + NaF at
400°C.

The various Fz'UFe mixtures used in the study
were produced by equilibration in a nickel reservoir
vessel (250-ml volume) containing about 100 g of
UF, at 54°C (PUF6 = 660 mm Hg) with the ap-

propriate precalibrated mixtures of fluorine and
nitrogen. (The temperature of the UF  reservoir
was held constant to +0.5°C by means of a care-
fully controlled water bath.) By adjusting the
initial F, /N, ratio, mixtures with F, concentra-
tions ranging from 11 to 0.3 vol % at atmospheric
pressure were obtained. Each mixture was allowed
to pass through a 10-g bed of NaF (~12 +20 mesh)
at 400°C for 20 min. Unreacted UF passing through
the bed was recovered on a backup trap of NaF at
100°C.

In the first three of a series of six tests, the
fluorine concentrations in the gas mixture were
11, 5.5, and 2.1 vol % respectively (see Table
31.1). Subsequent coulometric analyses of the
beds for uranium yielded calculated values for
equilibrium constants of 3.8 x 10°, 3.3 x 10°, and
4.2 x 10° respectively. The equilibrium value, K,
was calculated by means of the equation

UF g

K= 1/2

’

in which NU is the mole fraction of uranium
present on the NaF; it was assumed that the

activity of NaF was unity. The close correspondence
of these values indicated that equilibrium condi-
tions were obtained. Inrun 5 the UF, reservoir

to eliminate the need for a low fluorine 6flow rate
at low fluorine concentrations. In this test a
fluorine concentration of 0.3 vol % was achieved.
The calculated equilibrium constant was 1.3 x 107,

which was somewhat lower than those values ob-
tained at higher F, concentrations. When UF
was passed through a similar 400°C NaF bed in
a test with no fluorine present (run 6), the amount
retained as a result of disproportionation was
3.64%. Comparison of this value with the cor-
responding value of 0.084% obtained in a test
where 0.3 vol % F, was present in the stream
demonstrates the necessity of having at least
0.3 vol % F, present during the decontamination
step of the process.

The results of the tests completed thus far
indicate that, if fluorine utilization is nearly
quantitative in the early part of the fluorination
step, a supplemental fluorine supply through the
sorption traps would be required.

31.3 EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON
SORPTION OF UF, BY NaF: COMPARISON
OF HIGH- AND LOW-SURFACE-AREA MATERIAL

Some uncertainty existed with regard to the cor-
rect temperature and type of NaF to be used for
recovering UF6 in the MSRE processing facility.
This uncertainty arose partially from the results
of one engineering test in the MSRE facility in
which it was observed that MoF  had not attained
equilibrium with sorption beds containing low-
surface-area NaF at about 35 to 45°C.

Two grades of porous NaF are available. A low-
surface-area product is prepared from NaF powder
by pelletizing with water, drying, and finally
fluorinating at 250 to 350°C. It is characterized
by a surface area of 0.07 m? /g and a void fraction
of 0.28. A high-surface-area product is prepared

by the decomposition of NaF - HF pellets at 200
to 400°C, followed by sintering at 400 to 700°C
to obtain pellet strength. It is characterized by a
surface area of about 1 m?/g and a void fraction
of 0.45.

A comparative study of UF, sorption at different
temperatures was therefore undertaken with the
two types of material. A series of six tests with
low-surface-area material in the range 25 to 100°C
clearly showed that temperature had a large ef-
fect. Two tests of high-surface-area material at
25 and 100°C gave practically identical results,
showing that temperature is not important with
this material.

The sorption tests were made by passing a mix-
ture of 15 mole % UF —85 mole % F, through a 5-g
test bed for 3 min. The sorption test trap was
maintained at constant temperature in a water
bath; a 5-g backup NaF trap was held at 100°C
for the sorption of UF passing through the test
material. Both traps were quartz U-tubes (8.5 mm
ID) specially designed for visibility so that the
yellow UF . 2NaF complex could be observed.
The traps were filled with sieved material: —8
+ 20 mesh for the low-surface-area NaF and — 12
+20 mesh for the high-surface-area material. The
F -UF, gas mixture was prepared by passing F,
through a UF6 reservoir held at 24°C in a constant-
temperature bath.

The sorption results were significantly better
for the high-surface-area NaF than for the low-
surface-area material (Table 31.2). Even at 80

and 100°C, the loss through the latter was an
order of magnitude greater than that through the
high-surface-area NaF. The quantitative data
were confirmed by visual observations: the

yellow sorption band in high-surface-area NaF was
never more than 1 to 2 cm in length (even at 25°C),
whereas the sorptive band with low-surface-area
material at 100°C was 4 to 5 cm.

A semilogarithmic plot of the low-surface-area
sorption data (Fig. 31.3) was surprisingly linear
through four points; this indicated that the process
was possibly diffusion controlled (based on an
apparent activation energy of only 4.6 kcal per

on Low-Surface-Area NaF with Temperature.

31.4 LINEAR VELOCITY IN SORPTION PROCESS

It is significant to compare the linear velocity
of the gas in the above tests with that expected
in the MSRE facility. When the carrier gas (Fz)
flow rate was 85 ml/min (STP), the linear velocity
was 4.9 fpm; a carrier gas flow rate of 30 std
liters/min in the MSRE facility would give a
velocity of 2.4 fpm. Although the factor of 2 be-
tween the two cases might be important, it seems
improbable that the difference in sorption behavior

325

of the two materials would be diminished to any
large extent.

31.5 DISPOSAL OF GASEOUS F, IN
KOH-KI-K B 0, SOLUTION

Difficulties encountered in the disposal of F,
by reaction with SO, to form SO,F, led to the
suggestion that the KOH-KI disposal method
should be evaluated as an alternative. A tank
capable of holding 1300 liters was available in
the MSRE facility for use with such a solution;
only a few piping changes were required. Lab-
oratory tests were therefore made to study selected
features of the process that might be important in
operation of the MSRE facility. Some of the tests
were made as the result of effects seen in cold
practice runs made in the MSRE. Observations
were made on the amount of corrosion to be ex-
pected, the effect of helium dilution of the fluorine,
the formation and character of precipitates, and
the permissible fraction of solution capacity which
should be used. Most of the work was carried out
with 2 M KOH-0.33 M KI solution; later this was
modified to include 0.2 ¥ K2B{4O7 to provide
neutron poisoning. The handling of mists and
smoke in the outlet stream of the scrubber rep-
resented another problem area which was in-
vestigated in the laboratory.

31.6 CORROSION

There was particular concern about corrosion of
the Inconel tank wall and of the Monel dip tube
initially installed in the tank.

Most of the tests were of 4-hr duration and con-
sisted in the addition of 0.8 g-mole of F, (0% F,—
50% He) per liter of scrub solution to attain 80%
of the theoretical saturation. The temperature
was usually not allowed to exceed 40°C. Com-
parison tests between Inconel and Monel, using
3/B-in.—OD tubing, showed that Inconel was def-
initely better (as stated to be true for oxidizing
alkaline solutions in International Nickel Company,
Inc., literature). Micrometer examination indicated
a corrosion rate of about 1 mil/hr at the tip for
Inconel; general corrosion over the exterior of the
dip tube was insignificant with both Inconel and
Monel. Corrosion at the tip seemed to be highly
localized and appeared to be primarily due to a
326

local acid condition formed in a thin film of liquid
that wets the inside wall of the tip. A ‘‘feather-
ing’’ effect was therefore usually observed.
Corrosion of either Inconel or Monel led to the
formation of a gelatinous precipitate (hydrated
metal oxides) which usually was slow in settling
out of solution. From observations of this pre-
cipitate, corrosion in solutions used to 50% capacity
appeared to be much less than in solutions used
to 80% capacity.
When a 47-mil-ID hole was used at the end of a
Monel dip line to simulate the linear velocity of
25 fps expected in the MSRE scrub tank, plugging
occurred due to the formation of corrosion products
from liquid left inside the tube. There was little
evidence of this type of plugging with 1/4- or 3/8-
in.-OD dip tubes.

31.7 HELIUM DILUTION OF FLUORINE

Use of a maximum fluorine concentration of 50%
in helium was recommended for the MSRE facility
due to observations of intermittent flames and
small violent pressure oscillations at the end of
dip tubes when pure F, was used. It seemed
likely that corrosion would be greater under these
conditions.

31.8 FORMATION OF KiO, PRECIPITATE

The oxidizing power of F, leads, in addition to
the evolution of Q,, to the formation of potassium
iodate (KIO,). Copious quantities of this material
were found to precipitate at 80% saturation; at S0%
saturation, its precipitation was only faintly notice-
able. X-ray diffraction and chemical analyses
were used to identify the material, which is pro-
duced in a rather pure form except for the presence
of corrosion products.

31.9 NEUTRON POISONING WITH K,B O,

Tests made at 0.16, 0.20, and 0.24 M K2B407
in 2 M KOH—-0.33 ¥ KI solution indicated that the
chemistry of the system was only affected at the
highest of these three concentrations (evidence of
molecular I2 production). This was in conformity
with an initial test where 0.5 ¥ K2B4O7 had been
found to cause the immediate release of free
iodine. Since 0.2M4 K, B, O, was equivalent to
8.75 g of boron per liter, this was considered
adequate for poisoning of the scrub solution.

31.10 HANDLING OF MIST AND SMOKE FROM
SCRUB SOLUTION

It was evident in all laboratory tests that a
certain amount of mist was always generated.
Efforts to identify the chemical components of
the mist were not successful, since the material
was extremely difficult to trap; however, analyses
for fluoride and iodide were extremely low. It
seemed probable that the mist was stabilized by
the presence of I, or H,0,.

In an engineering test of the MSRE facility, an
additional gas colloid problem was encountered.
Corrosion of the hot processing vessel (contain-
ing no salt) with fluorine led to the production of
MoF .. Hydrolysis of this MoF in the scrubber
led to production of an aerosol of hydrated MoO,
(based on chemical analyses and x-ray diffraction
results) which deposited and plugged the off-gas
line. Duplication of this MoO, aerosol production
was verified in laboratory tests with scrub solu-
tion and F2 containing Mok _.

Laboratory tests with different filtration and
trapping methods showed that only a high-efficiency
fiber-glass filter was highly effective in stopping
the MoO3 aerosol and, at the same time, the
always-present scrub mist. A high-efficiency
filter downstream of the scrub solution was there-
fore installed in the MSRE processing facility.
