INTRODUCTION

Molybdenum is one of the more important fission products
with respect to the amount produced as well as its thermal
neutron absorption cross section. Consequently the chemical
behavior of molybdenum and its fluorides in molten salt reac-
tor fuels which are in contact with graphite and Hastelloy

is of interest.l’z’3

A research program to determine the
extent and rate of the pertinent reactions has recently been
initiated. The necessary literature review of the fluorides
and oxyfluorides of molybdenum is summarized in this report

for the convenience of others.

MoF,

 

Reported methods for the synthesis of MoF; are:
1. MoBr; + 3HF —MoF; + 3HBr at 600° in a Pt boat en-
closed in a Cu tube.4
2. 2Mo + 6HF §%§;gs 2MOF; + 3H,.°
MoF; + Mo — MoF; at 400°C in a Ni capsule.
4, MoF; + SbF; —MoF; + ?. The SbF; was carried in a
stream of A at 150 to 200°C.6
The product produced by method (1) has different prop-
erties than that of methods (3) and (4). The authors of ref-

erence 6 stated that products similar to that obtained by

6

method (1) were produced under hydrolyzing conditions. The
properties of both materials are described below. Although
it is possible for MoF; to exist in two crystalline forms,
it is more likely that the product described in reference 4
is an oxyfluoride.
Properties reported for "MoF;" from method (1) are:
non-hygroscopic, dark pink, shows no evidence of melting or
subliming at 800°C in the absence of air, is isostructural with
ReO; and, TaF,; (cubic, space group Pm3m, a = 3.8985 = 0.005)
at <800°, has a distorted structure at >800°7 and is reduced
by H, to Mo metal.4 The material produced by method (2) was
found to be cubic by x-~ray analysis5 and is probably the
same as the product of method (1),

Properties reported6 for MoF,; from methods (3) and (4)
are: variable color (ochre, light-green, gray, black, dark
red, yellowish tan), stable to at least 900° in Ni under its
own pressure, stable to 500° under vacuum, disproportionates
above 600° to form Mo metal and higher fluorides, density
4.64 £ 0.07 g/cm3® (measured), 4.50 g/cm® (x-ray) and VF,
type structure (space group R3c¢) determined by x-ray and
neutron diffraction. Other workers (ref. 8) have confirmed
that MoF; has a bimolecular rhombohedral unit cell with the
R3c space group. They have also shown that the compound
is antiferromaghetic below 185°K. The trace of a neutron
diffraction powder pattern taken at 4.2°K may be found in

this reference.

The compounds MM0F615 (M = Na, K, Rb, Cs) were formed

by: 2MoF, + 2MI ~60° I, + 2MMoF, and the impurities removed
by exposure to vacuum at 200°C. All of these compounds form
white crystals which are stable at 250°C, but attack glass
above 250°C and turn blue in moist air. KMoF, has a magnetic
moment of 1.24 Bohr magnetons at 25°C, the low value being
attributed to spin orbit coupling. The Na, Rb6 and Cs com-

pounds are cubic with a = 8.20, 5.11, and 5.29A, respectively.

The values of Cp?, S°, H° - H), -(F° - HY)/T for gaseous

mental frequencies over the temperature range 50-1600°K and
are tabulated in references 21, 24, 27, 31, and 38.

The values of Cp determined calorimetrically for solid
and liquid MoF, from 50 to 298.5%°K are tabulated in refer-
ence 39. The enthalpy and entropy of gaseous MoF; from 400

ulated in reference 21 for solid 5-290.70°K, liquid 290.76

Container Materials

 

The fluorides of molybdenum react readily with moisture.
Hence the systems in which they are handled must be scrupu-
lously dried by outgasing, flaming, or baking. The following
container materials have been used with molybdenum fluorides:

Ni 13,18-21,23,41

Teflon 13,18,20,21,23,41
Fluorinated greases have been used,18 but packless all metal

values are to be preferreol.il'2 The use of NaF as an HF getter

will allow storage of MoF, in glass at room temperature for

18,20

many days without etching. In general, glass and plastic

type materials are useful to about 200°C above which the
metals are necessary.
