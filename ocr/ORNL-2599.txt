ANP PROJECT SEMIANNUAL PROGRESS REPORT

SUMMARY

PART 1. METALLURGY
1.1. Fabrication

Studies of the effect of heat treatment on the

mechanical properties at room temperature of arc-
" cast columbium prepared by the electron-beam
melting technique have indicated that specimens
heated at intermediate temperatures in the range
700 to 1000°C are more ductile than those heated
at the extremes of the range of treatment tempera-
tures. There is evidence, however, that the in-
creased ductility resulting from intermediate tem-
perature anneals of welds would not be retained at
higher temperatures and that stabilizing elements
will be required to neutralize the effects of inter-
stitial elements,

Electron-beam-melted columbium billets were
found to extrude readily if they were protected from
atmospheric contamination during heating, Arc-
melted material was found to be more difficult to
extrude, possibly because of a higher impurity
content,

Cracks found in drawn duplex and unclad colum-
bium tubing have indicated insufficient annealing
before tube reduction, and therefore a high-tempera-
ture, high-vacuum annealing furnace was designed
and is being built,

Since it appears that the production of satis-
factory columbium bodies will require either high-
purity metal or special alloys, purification and
alloying investigations are under way. Resistance
heating of columbium wire in vacuum at tempera-
tures up to its melting point has shown significant
reductions in nitrogen and oxygen content. Melting
stock has been obtained from which special alloys
will be prepared. Beryllium, zirconium, and cerium
will be used to neutralize residual oxygen. High-
purity columbium specimens contaminated with
known quantities of oxygen or nitrogen are being
prepared for corrosion testing in lithium,

Methods for obtaining highly pure yttrium metal
and hydrogen are being studied in order to de-
termine the effects of impurities on the hydriding
of yttrium. It is hoped that purification will alle-
viate the tendency of yttrium metal to crack during
hydriding and during thermal cycling of the hydrided
metal, The electron-beam melting process was

shown to be useful for removing fluorides and
traces of magnesium from yttrium metal, but it was
ineffective in removing traces of oxygen or nitrogen
or farge quantities of magnesium. Equipment for
the production of yttrium metal from YF 5 has been
expanded to pilot-plant scale,

1.2. Corrosion

Studies of the various methods of purifying lithium
of oxygen and nitrogen have continved. As part of
these investigations, samples were taken of the
lithium shipments received from vendors and ana-
lyzed for oxygen by several methods in order to
compare various analytical techniques. The analy-
ses showed that it will probably be necessary to
purify all lithium received.

Experiments are being conducted to determine
the solubility of lithium nitride and lithium oxide in
tithium, An average value of approximately 1300
pPpm oxygen was obtained recently that is consider-
ably lower than the value obtained previously.

The ability of yttrium to getter impurities from
lithium is being investigated. Hardness increases
and vacuum-fusion analysis results indicate that
yttrium getters both oxygen and nitrogen from
lithium, but no reductions in the oxygen or nitrogen
contents of the lithium bath have been found.

Static tests of several grades of arc-cast colum-
bium tubing have been conducted. Preliminary
results indicate that surface contamination and
subsequent diffusion of the impurities into the
cofumbium during annealing may account for some
of the previously observed attack of columbium by
lithium,

Two joining techniques for columbium, braze
welding and fusion welding, and three types of
gaseous environment were investigated to determine
their effects on the hardness of columbium and its
corrosion resistance to lithium. A marked reduc-
tion in depth and severity of attack was noted as
the purity of the gaseous welding environment was
improved. Appreciable decreases in the hardness
of the as-welded columbium specimens as a result
of exposure to lithium again indicated gettering of
oxygen from the columbium by the lithium.

A series of seesaw-furnace tests of molybdenum
in contact with lithium was conducted. The results
indicate, in general, that molybdenum has excellent
resistance to attack and mass transfer at hot-zone
temperatures as high as 1900°F, Dissimilar-metal
mass transfer of Inconel to the molybdenum was
observed in the Inconel-sodium-molybdenum section
of the test capsule. No molybdenum failures either
in the base material or in weld zones have been
encountered in the tests conducted thus far,

Similar seesaw-furnace tests of columbium-lithium
systems have been initiated. In the one test (hot
zone, 1600°F; cold zone, 1100°F; test duration,
300 hr) completed to date, columbium exhibited
excellent resistance to attack and mass transfer,

Static corrosion tests of beryllium specimens in
lithium in iron capsules and in beryllium capsules
at 1500 and at 1830°F showed beryllium to be
quite resistant to attack by static lithium in an
all-beryltium system. It was very heavily attacked,
however, when tested in the iron container,

Refractory-metal-base brazing alloys are being
corrosion tested in high-temperature lithium, since
commercially available brazing alloys have very
limited corrosion resistance to lithium,

A method was developed (under subcontract at
NDA) for measuring the rates at which container
metals dissolve in liquid lithium, The solution rate
measurements confirmed the deleterious effects of
nitrogen and oxygen and the beneficial effect of
aluminum on mass transfer in lithium as noted in
thermal-convection loop tests.

1.3. Welding and Brazing

A survey of phase diagrams of refractory-metal-
base binary systems has revealed several promising
brazing alloys. Vacuum-brazing equipment has
been constructed for studying these systems, and
flowability and corrosion tests are under way.
Studies of the diffusion of the brazing alloy into
columbium are also being initiated. If diffusion or
alloying occurs it may increase the remelt tempera-
ture of the brazing alloy and thus increase the
maximum service temperature,

A small,glass dry box containing a stationary
torch and a movable table was assembled for
welding studies on columbium and molybdenum.
This equipment will be used in investigating the
weldability of these materials under highly con-
trolled degrees of atmospheric purity. Several butt
welds made on arc-cast columbium sheet in a puri-
fied argon atmosphere were found to be ductile,

vi

1.4. Mechanical Properties

Equipment has been developed for tensile and
creep tests of materials in controlled environments
at temperatures up to 2500°F. Several successful
tests have been completed on molybdenum at
2000°F.

Creep and rupture properties of Inconel have been
investigated in tubes with both internal pressure
and axial stress, The creep data obtained compare
favorably with the theoretical curves derived from
Soderberg’s analysis and the von Mises and Tresca
flow rules. Fracture cannot be predicted by the
maximum principal stress criterion,

Dynamic load tests have been conducted on
Inconel rods and tubes that were programed on the
basis of plastic strain rather than stress. A simple
relationship, in the form N = K, exists between
the number of cycles to failure and the plastic
strain absorbed in each cycle, The constants a
and K are found to vary as a function of the ma-
terial and test conditions. On the other hand,
geometry, temperature variations in the range 1300
to 1600°F, and small variations in chemical compo-
sition do not significantly alter the cycle life of a
material, Strains induced thermally show excellent
correlation on the basis of equivalent amounts of
plastic strain per cycle with mechanically induced
strains in temperature ranges where the material is
metallurgically stable. The frequency at which the
material is strained is observed to infiuence the
number of cycles that can be survived. The slow
frequencies, particularly at low amplitudes, appear
to produce the most deleterious results.

1.5. Ceramics

Small batches of zirconium boride were synthe-
sized for incorporation into BeO bodies. The ma-
terial prepared by an improved process was found
to be >97% pure. Several additives were tested as
means for increasing the density of BeO. Of the
various combinations tested, it was found that a
body with 94 wt % BeQ, 5 wt % MgO, and 1 wt %
B4C had the greatest density.

Screening tests were run to determine the oxida-
tion resistance of TaB,, TiB,, CrB2, HfBz, BN,
and ZrB, when added to high-density BeO. The
ZrBz-BeO and HfBz-BeO combinations were found
to be superior to the other mixtures. Attempts to
fabricate large hot-pressed blocks of the ZrB,-BeO
mixture for which a commercial grade of ZrB_ was
used revealed the need for pure ZrB.,. The commer-
cial grade of ZrB2 was found to contain about 10%
Fe. Uniform blocks were obtained when pure ZrB,
was used,

1.6, Nondestructive Testing

Studies of the use of x-ray sensitive Vidicon in a
closed-circuit television system for remote viewing
of x-ray images were continued. It was found that
the sensitivity of the selenium photoconductor to
x-rays could be improved by admitting visible light
to the photoconductor surface, Contrast sensitivity
was increased by as much as a factor of 3. Thick-
ness changes of about 2,5% were detected in E}B-in.-
thick aluminum,

Investigations are being made of the applicability
of existing ultrasonic techniques to the inspection
of duplex tubing, It appears that the resonance
ultrasonic technique can be developed as a means
for evaluating the quality of the bond between the
materials,

1.7. Metallography

A 20-tube semicircular heat exchanger fabricated
of Inconel in which a fused salt flowing around the
tubes exchanged heat to NaK flowing in the tubes
was examined metallographically to determine the
location and effects of the leak that caused termi-
nation of operation. The heat exchanger, which
had operated 1139 hr at 1200°F and above, had
experienced 194 thermal cycles between isothermal
operation at 1200°F and operation at design condi-
tions (fused salt inlet and outlet temperatures of
1600 and 1250°F and NaK inlet and outlet tempera-
tures of 1070 and 1500°F.)

The leak of NaK to fused salt was found to have
been the result of fracture of three tubes in the
high-temperature header area. The cracks were
radial and propagated from the tension side of the
tubes; they were in the tubes with the shortest
tube bend-to-tube sheet length (]'/8 to 3/4in.). The
maximum depth of corrosion attack on the fused-
salt side of the tubes was 0,006 in., and, on the
NaK side, it was 0.002 in.

PART 2. CHEMISTRY AND RADIATION DAMAGE
2.1. Materials Chemistry

Sufficient fluoride mixture for the first charge
of the equipment in the yttrium-metal pilot plant was
prepared. The YF, needed was prepared by direct
fluorination of dry Y,0,. A mean conversion
efficiency of 99% and suitably low oxygen contents
were obtained. Magnesium fluoride for the process

was prepared by dry hydrofluorination of MgO; the
mean conversion efficiency was 97.7%.

Sufficient information with which to construct a
portion of the phase diagram of the LiF-YF3 system
was obtained, A single eutectic occurs in the
system at 19 mole % YF,; mp, 682°C.,

Further experimental information was obtained
regarding a tentative procedure for purifying lithium
metal by extracting oxide, nitride, and carbide
impurities with a eutectic mixture of lithium halide
salts. The second extraction of each series of
extractions showed considerable reduction in the
concentration of impurities.

2.2, Analytical Chemistry

The method for the determination of oxygen in
fluoride salts by fluorination with KBrF , was
successfully applied, The coefficient of variation
of the method, as based on duplicate analyses of
seven samples, was 6% in measurements of the
salt LiF-Mng-YFB. The recovery of oxygen added
as MgO and Y203 exceeded 98%, with a precision
of 2%.

A rapid method was adapted for the determination
of magnesium and yttrium in LiF-Mng-YF3 by
titration with a standard solution of ethylene-
diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Amalgamated
gold serves as the indicator electrode. Both ele-
ments are titrated in the same solution by adjust-
ment of the pH of the solution. No interferences
were encountered in the application of the method
to LiF-MgF ,-YF,. The precision of the method is
about 1%.

2,3. Radiation Damage

Experimental apparatus is being prepared with
which to test the stability of yttrium hydride and
beryllium oxide thermally cycled at high tempera-
tures in a high gamma-ray heating region of the
Engineering Test Reactor. Mockup tests have
been run on the heat removal system and on the
thermocouple design. The heat removal system
will provide a temperature control method in that
it will be possible to vary the heat conductivity of
the cooling gas by varying the concentration of
argon and helium in the gas mixture. Stainless steel
was selected as the test capsule material as a re-
sult of compatibility tests. Examinations and meas-
urements of the samples will be made before irradi-
ation and repeated after irradiation.

Stress-rupture experiments in air on tube-burst
specimens of Inconel were completed in the MTR.

vii
Preparations are being made for similar tube-burst
tests and creep tests in the fast flux of the ORR,

In conjunction with studies of the effects of
radiation on semiconductor barriers, a cryostat was
constructed that has a temperature range of —200°C
to +350°C, Requirements, other than the tempera-
ture range, were long term reliability and “‘fail

_safe’’ operation. A cooling water failure or an
electrical failure will shut the cryostat down with-
out harmful effects to any of the system components,
Temperatures in the sample chamber can be main-
tained to within ]/4°C, with a gradient along the
length of the copper section of the sample chamber
of ]/4°C.

A grown-junction silicon diode has been irradiated
in a fast-neutron flux facility in the ORNL Graphite
Reactor to an integrated dosage of 1.8 x 101>
neutrons/cm?. Changes in forward and reverse
current at l-volt bias were recorded. A change in
reverse current on the order of a factor of 100 in-
crease was observed that is to be compared with an
increase of 200% for a comparable irradiation of an
alloy-junction diode and an increase of 30% in a
point-contact diode.

Attempts were made to alloy indium and germanium
at low temperatures, and crystal growths were pro-
duced that had not been noted before. Penetration
of indium into the germanium conformed to precise
geometric configurations, and it is thought that
such penetration may be indicative of the early
steps of the alloying process.

PART 3. ENGINEERING

3.1, Component Development and Testing

The oil-lubricated pump rotary element that is
being operated in a gamma-radiation field in the
MTR canal will have accumulated a total dosage
of 1 x 10'? by September 30. Operation of the seal
continues to be comparable to that of a seal
operated without irradiation for a similar period of
time. Analyses of the bulk and leakage oil have
indicated little change.

A Fulton-Sylphon seal on a sump-type centrifugal
pump that is circulating NaK at 1200°F, 1200 rpm,
and 1200 gpm has operated satisfactorily during
more than 7200 hr. A similar pump that had oper-
ated in the cavitation region with NaK as the
pumped fluid for 1096 hr was stopped because of
a drain valve leak. No damage was evident upon
disassembly of the pump, The data are being

viii

analyzed. A similar pump that is operating with a
fused salt has logged over 10,300 hr of operation. -
A third thin-shell mode| that was tested under
high-temperature thermal cycling conditions is
being disassembled for examination. A test loop
failure caused termination of the test after 602
thermal cycles; that is, 302 more than the scheduled
300 thermal cycles.

3.2. Heat Transfer Studies

Experimental studies of the effect of thermal-
stress cycling on structural materials were con-
tinued with the pulse-pump system, The dependence
of surface failure (cracking of Inconel) on cyclic
frequency was investigated in tests at 0.1, 0.4, and
1.0 cps. Maximum damage occurred at 0.1 cps,
with cracks as deep as 0.207 in. being observed.

At the highest frequency, no cracks were found at

the end of a 100-hr (360,000 cycles) exposure. An

attempt was made to correlate the results with

mechanical fatigue data, and, in general, it appears

that, for a given strain, failure occurs earlier (fewer

cycles) with surface thermal cycling than with

mechanical cycling. v

Analyses of data obtained from a mercury system
in the study of heat transfer in a liquid metal with
internal heat generation were completed. On the
average, the data indicate surface-to-fluid mean
temperature differences 49% higher than those
predicted by the analogy. Since the experiment was
designed so that gaseous films or scale at the wall
could not influence the experimental results, it is
concluded that the diffusivity ratio is less than
unity for mercury.

Studies of heat transfer between a heated tube
surface and air in high-velocity vortex motion were
continued. Data with both forced- and free-vortex
flow indicate values of the heat-transfer coefficient
significantly above those obtained with linear flow
and equal flow power dissipation in identical
geometries.

3.3. Instrumentation and Controls

An initial check of the data acquisition system
purchased from the G. M. Giannini Company was
made and minor troubles and design inadequacies
were noted, The system is being modified and -
should be back in operation soon.

Life tests of three level probes operating in NaK
were continued. Similar tests in sodium were
initiated. Overrange tests designed to accelerate

-

the effects of aging on pressure transmitters were
continued. Slight bulging of the Inconel bodies
was observed after 5100 hr at 1400°F.

Life tests of a series of Inconel-sheathed thermo-
couples exposed to a fused salt were terminated
after about 11,000 hr at 1500°F. The thermocouples
were performing well when the test was stopped,
but the errors were increasing. Similar thermo-
couples have been under test in a sodium environ-
ment for about 16,000 hr. Many of these thermo-
couples now show considerable error.

Studies of the fundamental behavior of thermo-
couples in the range 300 to 1100°C are under way
under subcontract at the University of Tennessee.
Work on the improvement of the Oracle program for
thermocouple-data handling is nearing completion,

3.4, Applied Mechanics

Basic studies are under way of the elastic be-
havior of five structural configurations commonly
used in reactor design. The configurations being
analyzed are a flat circular plate, a tapered circular
plate, a cylindrical shell, a conical shell, and a
spherical shell. The stress and displacement
formulas and tables of numerical values for all the
functions involved are being obtained. The study
of the conical shetl, which has been completed,
provides for analyses of a conical shell with a
combination of axisymmetrical loads. The loads
may include membrane forces and uniform pressure,
in addition to edge moments and shear forces.

3.5. Advanced Power Plant Design

As part of a program for examining the feasi-
bility of the vortex reactor concept, experimental
studies were made of the vortex strengths ob-
tainable in a gas under a variety of conditions.

A survey was made of various types of auxiliary
power units suitable for use in satellites, A pre-
liminary evaluation was made of reactor cycles
employing either aluminum chloride or rubidium
vapor as the heat transfer medium.

PART 4. SHIELDING

4.1, Shielding Theory

A calculation was performed to obtain predicted
pulse-height spectra of capture and inelastic-
scattering gamma rays which could be compared
with the experimental spectra obtained in an ex-
periment at the Tower Shielding Facility. While

experimental cross sections were available for the
calculation of the nitrogen capture gamma-ray
spectrum, many of the cross sections used to pre-
dict the spectrum of inelastic-scattering gamma
rays were theoretical, In spite of this, the shapes
of the calculated and experimental pulse-height
spectra were in agreement,

It has previously been reported that an Oracle
Monte Carlo calculation of the penetration of mono-
energetic, monodirectional gamma rays in a lead
and water shield has included a total of 512 prob-
lems. Some typical plots of the heating results
from these calculations are presented as the per-
centage of the total energy incident upon the slab
absorbed in a specified region. The results are
compared with an empirical formula,

The Oracle Monte Carlo code was used to calcu-
late the primary gamma-ray heating in a stab shield
similar to that being used in the GE-BSF experi-
ment. |t was assumed that the slab thicknesses
were the same as those in the experiment and that
they were infinite in the other two directions. Most
of the assumptions made in the calculation caused
the results to be too high, possibly as much as a
factor of 1.5. This is corroborated by GE calcu-
lations of the heating which were based on an
analysis of the thermocouple measurements and
which were a factor of 2 lower than the results of
this Monte Carlo calculation,

A Monte Carlo code is being developed for the
IBM-704 machine to calculate the angular and
energy distributions, at a point detector, of gamma
rays emitted from a monoenergetic, point isotropic,
or point monodirectional source embedded in an
infinite homogeneous isotropic medium, The code
is now in the ‘‘debugging’’ stage.

Neutron dose-rate distributions beyond water
slabs 1, 3, 4, and 6 mfp thick were calculated for
plane monodirectional, monoenergetic sources
incident on the slabs at angles of 0, 30, 60, and
75deg. The source energies considered were
0.55, 1.2, 2, 4, 6, and 8 Mev. Dose-rate buildup
factors calculated for the various sources are pre-
sented, as well as the dose rates at the rear of the
slabs resulting from neutrons multiply scattered
within the slabs,

4.2. Lid Tank Shielding Facility

The final measurements taken in the L TSF ex-
periment designed by GE-ANP for the study of the
production of secondary gamma rays in configura-
tions containing advanced shielding materials are
presented. |n most of these last configurations,

all of which were tested in oil, the effectiveness
of various thickness of stainless steel with and
without boral was investigated, One configuration
that consisted only of berylium and lithium hydride
in oil was also tested,

A study of the production of secondary gamma
rays in lead was made with lead thicknesses that
varied from 1 to 9 in. The lead was followed by
either an oil medium or a borated-water medium in
which gamma-ray dose-rate measurements were
made. From these tests it appears that the first
3 in. of lead attenvated most of the primary gamma
rays from the LTSF source plate; further, the total
dose rutes at fixed distances from the source were
not affected when the lead thickness was increased
beyond 3 in, The measurements in the borated
water were a factor of 3 lower than the dose rates
in the oii in the region close to the lead and were
a factor of 13 lower approximately 120 cm beyond
the lead.

A corrected curve of thermal-neutron flux meas-
urements in oil at the LTSF is presented. It is
16% higher than the curve presented previously.

Shields consisting of randomly distributed ab-
sorbing chunks in a relatively transparent matrix:
must be from a few per cent to several hundred per
cent greater in mass than homogeneous shields
which give the same amount of attenuation, This
is the result of radiation ‘‘channeling’’ in the
spaces between the absorbing chunks. A method
for calculating the transmission of radiation through
heterogeneous shields has been developed, and a
typical calculation for boral has been performed.
The computed results are compared with experi-
mental results.

4.3. Bulk Shielding Facility

The planned series of measurements for the GE-
BSF study of the production of heat in radiation
shields was completed, but the results are of
questionable value since it has been discovered
that all of the heating samples leaked and oil
entered the air region surrounding the samples.
The series, which consists of configurations of
beryllium and lithium hydride separated by a
gamma-ray shielding section (iron, lead, or Mallory
1000), is being repeated with new samples.

4.4. Tower Shielding Focility

The experiment performed at the Tower Shielding
Facility in cooperation with Convair, Fort Worth,
to obtain information complementary to that obtained
from the Nuclear Test Airplane (NTA) program has
been completed. During the NTA program of ex-
periments, gamma-ray and fast-neutron dose rates
and thermal-neutron fluxes were measured both
inside and outside the airframe containing the
reactor while in flight and on the ground. Measure-
ments were also made on the ground in the absence
of the airplane structure. This last set of measure-
ments was duplicated in the TSF experiments, and,
in addition, measurements were made as a function
of altitude in the absence of the airplane structure.
With these additional measurements the influence
of the air, the ground, and the aircraft structure
on the various measurements can be determined.
The TSF experiment also included angular mappings
of the radiation around the various reactor shield
configurations, near the ground and at altitude,
to obtain data which will yield more accurate source
terms than were previously available. Some gamma-
ray and neutron energy spectra were also determined.

Predictions of the gamma-ray and fast-neutron
dose rates at large distances from the Tower
Shielding Reactor |l (TSR-Il) have been made for
two operating conditions. For the first case the
reactor was assumed to be bare and to be operating
at a 5-Mw power at an altitude of 200 ft, a condition
which would result in the highest dose rates that
could be achieved with the reactor, The gamma-ray
dose-rate calculations for the bare reactor were
based on measurements taken at large distances
from the TSR-|, while the fast-neutron dose-rate
calculations were based both on the TSR-| data
and on other measurements made at large distances
from the Aircraft Shield Test Reactor (ASTR). For
the second case the reactor was assumed to be
encased in a “‘beam’’ shield which would allow a
highly collimated beam of radiation to be emitted
from the reactor. This calculation, which was
based on measurements made at large distances
from the TSR-l in a simulated beam shield, is con-
sidered to be more representative of a typical
operation. The results for both cases are plotted
as a function of distance from the reactor. As part
of this investigation, a calculation was made of
the uncollided neutron flux 4200 ft from the TSR-I

to obtain a fast-neutron buildup factor for the case

Fad
in which an air-filled collimator extending through
the reactor shield is pointed at the detector,

4.5, Tower Shielding Reactor Il

The latest design of the TSR-Il, with its asso-
ciated controls and 5-Mw water cooling system, and

several studies supporting the design are pre-
sented. The critical mass has been set at 8.1 kg
with 1,6% excess reactivity. Control will be
achieved by moving six umbrella-shaped grids of
Inconel-clad cadmium in the internal water re-
flector, A description of the first shield is also
presented,

COLUMBIUM INVESTIGATIONS

Effect of Heat Treatment on
Mechanical Properties

D. O. Hobson

Studies were continued in an investigation of the
effect of heat treatment on the room-temperature
properties of a cast columbium ingot prepared by the

H. Inouye

electron-beam melting technique. The results of
these experiments will provide information needed
for determining the feasibility of forging castings
at room temperature to prevent contamination and
for assessing room temperature evaluation of the
probable performance of fusion welds.

Notched-bend specimens machined from the ingot
were heat treated at 50°C intervals from 700 to
1000°C in a dynamic vacuum of 2 x 10~¢ mm Hg
for periods ranging from 168 hr at the lower temper-
atures to 72 hr at the higher temperatures. The
effects of these heat treatments were evaluated
from the standpoints of fracture mode, microstruc-
ture, and ductility as determined from an integrated
plot of the load-deflection curves. In all cases, the
fracture occurred transgranularly and showed no
trend with respect to the heat-treatment temper-
ature. Microstructurally, no differences were noted,
and no second phases were detected when the
samples were examined at a magnification of 1500
times. The results of triplicate slow-bend tests of
specimens heat treated at a particular temperature
exhibited considerable scatter, however. The
fractures did not always occur at the base of the
notch, and it is thought that the variations in the
location of fracture may have affected the test re-
sults. The data presented in Table 1.1.1 indicate,
however, that the specimens treated at intermediate
temperatures were more ductile than those heated at
the extremes of the range of treatment temperatures.
The values presented in Table 1.1.1 are the lowest
of the three values obtained in the triplicate tests.
The material from which the specimens were ma-
chined had the following impurities: 0.01% C,
0.12% 0,, 0.0013% H,, and 0.032% N ,.

The data of Table 1.1.1 show some correlation
with results obtained in previous cold rolling and
bend tests of similar heat-treated specimens from
this ingot. |t was found previously that an inter-
mediate-temperature anneal improved the fabri-
cability. The instability exhibited by the metal

Extrusion Studies
D. O. Hobson

Fifteen columbium billets were extruded during

H. Inouye

the period covered by this report. Nine tube ex-
trusions and two rod extrusions were successful,
and four billets failed to extrude satisfactorily,
The data obtained in these experiments are pre-
sented in Table 1.1.2. No difficulties were ex-
perienced in extruding electron-beam-melted ma-
terial so long as it was protected from atmospheric
contamination during heating. The protection was
provided by copper plating the billets, covering
them with powdered graphite, and heating them in
an inert-atmosphere furnace. Arc-melted material
tends to be more difficult to extrude, possibly be-
cause of its higher impurity content. Efforts have
been made to extrude columbium bare, that is, with-

out the copper plate, but this leads to surface con-
tamination and in the case of tube blanks results

Purification Experiments
D. O. Hobson

The possibility of purifying columbium by anneal-
ing at high temperatures in vacuum is being investi-
gated. A vacuum system is being used in which a
columbium wire can be resistance heated to temper-
atures up to its melting point, 2415°C. The results
of one series of tests for 30-min periods at various
temperatures and pressures are presented in Fig.
1.1.3. In future experiments, the effect of varying

H. Inouye

the heating time at constant temperatures will be
studied.

Special Alloy Preparations
T. K. Roche

Special columbium alloy specimens are being pre-
pared for evaluation in molten lithium. The avail-
able evidence indicates that the mechanism of
corrosion of columbium by lithium is related to the
presence of oxygen in the “‘pure’’ metal. The
addition of alloying materials that are potentially
capable of neutralizing the residual oxygen should
therefore be beneficial, The alloy additions pres-
ently being considered are beryllium, zirconium, and
cerium, Columbium melting stock has been pre-
pared from sheet material received from DuPont,
which has been found, by chemical analysis, to
contain 0.032 wt % C, 0.0003 wt % H,, 0.0084 wt %
N,, and 0.053 wt % O,. Prior to the preparation of
the alloys, the fabricability of the unalloyed ma-
terial melted by normal arc-melting procedures will
be evaluated.

Effects of Oxygen and Nitrogen Contamination
on Corrosion by Lithium

J. E. Spruiell H. Inouye

Experimental studies of the absorption of oxygen
and nitrogen by pure columbium in the temperature
range of 800 to 1600°C at pressures ranging from
3x 104 to 1 x 10~ mm Hg were initiated. The
preliminary tests of nitrogen pickup consisted of
(1) sealing specimens of columbium and hot-pressed
boron nitride or hot-pressed silicon nitride in
quartz capsules and heating for 20, 50, and 75 hr at
temperatures of 900, 1000, and 1100°C; and (2) in-
troducing purified nitrogen of a given partial pres-
sure into a previously evacuated furnace which
contained columbium.

The results of the tests in which the columbium
specimens and boron nitride or silicon nitride were
sealed in quartz capsules were evaluated in terms
of weight change and change in chemical analysis.

VSummer employee.

The weight-change measurements indicated that
the columbium specimens had absorbed some gas,
but chemical analysis proved the absorbed material
to be primarily oxygen rather than nitrogen. The
data for one columbium specimen sealed with boron
nitride under a pressure of 3 x 10~ mm Hg in
quartz are presented in Tables 1.1.3 and 1.1.4,
Since the change in weight indicated a total im-
purity pickup of only 0.09%, it appears that the
analyses are somewhat incorrect, but they do indi-
cate the relatively higher pickup of oxygen than of
nitrogen. Eleven specimens were given similar
tests, and all the results were of the same order of
magnitude. The hot-pressed boron and silicon
nitrides apparently contained decomposable oxide
impurities.

In a second series of tests, columbium speci-
mens were heated in a purified nitrogen atmosphere
in a furnace at temperatures up to 1300°C for 1 hr.
No significant weight changes were observed. In
these tests nitrogen pressures from 0.5 to 3 x 10~3
were used. The specimens were bright after the
tests, but they reflected light in @ way that re-
vealed thin transparent films on their surfaces.
The effect of the pressure of the nitrogen on film
formation has not been studied completely, but it is

believed to be small. There may be a critical pres-
sure below which absorption occurs without the
formation of the nitride film. None of these speci-
mens were analyzed because the weight-gain data
indicated no measurable absorption of any gas.
Furnaces and equipment capable of operating at
much higher temperatures are being fabricated so
that the range of study may be increased.

Oxygen-contaminated specimens were made by
introducing purified oxygen into a previously evac-
uated furnace containing columbium specimens.
The gas was introduced in such a manner as to
maintain a constant partial pressure of oxygen.
Various concentrations of oxygen were obtained by
leaving the specimens at temperature in the oxygen
atmosphere for various times. By this method,
specimens containing from 61 to 5000 ppm oxygen
were prepared by heating at 850°C under a partial
pressure of 2 x 10~ mm Hg O, for times ranging
up to 16 hr, These specimens are being tested to
determine the effects of oxygen contamination on
corrosion of columbium by lithium.

YTTRIUM AND YTTRIUM HYDRIDE
INVESTIGATIONS

W. J. Werner T. Hikido

Effect of Metal Purity on Hydriding
It has been reported by GE-ANPD that con-

siderable difficulty has been encountered with re-
spect to cracking of hydrided pieces of yttrium.
The cracks form both during hydriding and upon
thermal cycling of the hydrided piece. There has
been some evidence that the cracking is associated
with nonmetallic inclusions which may be observed
in the microstructure of the metal, and it is hoped
that improvement of the purity of the yttrium will
alleviate the cracking problem. Conclusive proof
of the effect of impurities is still unavailable, how-
ever, because of the lack of high-purity metal. At
the present time, studies are under way on the zone
refining of yttrium by the floating-zone procedure
developed by Kneip and Betterton 2 for the zone
refining of zirconium, Work has also been started
on the evaluation of various procedures for the
purification of hydrogen. With pure metal and pure

hydrogen, it will be possible to compare the prop-
erties of a high-purity hydride with the properties
of hydrides having various impurity contents,

Dissociation Pressure Studies

No accurate set of dissociation pressure curves
for the YH system is, as yet, available. A dis-
sociation pressure rig is therefore being constructed,
and measurements will be made of as pure a hy-
dride as is obtainable. The effects of impurities
on the dissociation pressure will also be determined.

Deformation Mechanisms of Yttrium

The growth of single crystals of yttrium is being
attempted in connection with a program to study the
deformation mechanisms of high-purity yttrium. The
first method to be tried for the growth of these
single crystals is that of growing the crystals from
the melt (zone refining). A strain-anneal technique
will also be tried.

Electron-Beam Melting of Yttrium and
Yttrium=Magnesium Alloy

W. J. Werner T. Hikido

The Temescal Metallurgical Corporation, Rich-
mond, California, has developed a technique for
melting metals under a high vacuum in which the
energy of a focused electron beam is used. The
furnace consists essentially of a vacuum pumping
system, an electron **qun’’ and power supply, a
melting-stock feeding device, and a water-cooled
copper crucible with an ingot extraction mechanism.
The electron gun has a circular tungsten filament
electron source, focusing devices, and a power
source which supplies a high-potential electric
field through which the electrons are accelerated,
The electron gun is designed to concentrate part of
the electron beam on the end of the melting stock
as it is lowered into the furnace and the balance
on the surface of melted metal ingot in the crucible.
The metal melted from the stock drips into the
crucible where a molten pool is maintained and the
ingot is continuously extracted. The major ad-
vantages of the Temescal process are (1) the high
vacuum (104 mm Hg) maintained during melting and
(2) the use of water-cooled copper to minimize
crucible contamination,

The electron-beam melting technique was used to
investigate the possibility of purifying yttrium metal
with respect to O, N,, Li, Mg, and C content, and
the possibility of consolidating yttrium-magnesium

alloy directly into a pure metal ingot without going
through the vacuum-distillation step, Calculations
by A. R. Miller® showed that it should be thermo-
dynamically possible to purify yttrium by melting it
under a high vacuum. The consolidation of the
yttrium-magnesium alloy was also thought to be
possible if the melting were done by using a slow
feed rate and a low power input to the electron gun.

For the experimental investigation, one bar of
yttrium metal made up of six finger castings Heliarc
welded together and two bars of yttrium-magnesium
alloy ~ 1Y% in. in diameter and 10 in. long were sent
to the Temescal Metallurgical Corporation. The bar
of yttrium metal was double melted. The first meit
was accomplished at a feed rate of ~ ]/3 Ib of metal
per hour with maximum power input to the gun.

This melt was characterized by a heavy purple
plasma which surrounded the electron gun, metal
stock, and the melt, The density of this plasma,
which was composed chiefly of lithium and mag-
nesium, controlled the melting rate for a given power
input. At too fast a melting rate, the plasma be-
came dense enough to short out the filament to the
focusing device. The plasma was considerably less
dense during the second melt, and a faster melting
rate, was, therefore, possible.

The original analyses of the six finger castings
and the analysis of samples taken from the bottom
of the first melt and from the top, middle, and
bottom of the second melt are presented in Table
1.1.5. The results indicate that the electron-beam
melting did not purify the metal with respect to
oxygen and nitrogen and that the melting may have
actually resulted in some additional contamination.
There did seem to be some degree of purification
between the first and second melts, however, and
the method should be very effective in removing
magnesium, lithium, and any volatile fluorides.
Therefore, consideration will be given to further
experiments with electron~beam melting when larger
quantities of metal become available., Even if re-
moval of the oxygen and nitrogen does not prove to
be possible, it will be of considerable interest to
minimize the other impurities in order to determine
the true effect of the gases. The fluorides and
oxyfluorides are currently suspected of contributing
heavily to the difficulties encountered in working
yttrium metal and with cracking in hydrided yttrium.

Attempts to process the 80 wt % Y~20 wt % Mg
alloy directly to the metal ingot by the electron-
beam technique were unsuccessful. It was thought
that if a low melting rate were maintained and the
power input ke pt low, the magnesium could be
driven off and the metal melted. However, when the
beam of electrons was foacused on the-alloys the++
magnesium boiled out violently with considerable
splattering. Some of the magnesium deposited on
the filament and focusing shield and caused short
circuiting of the filament. It was not possible to
control the splattering and shorting, and therefore
the melting attempts had to be abandoned.

Expansion of YHrium Preparation Process
T. Hikido
In March 1958, the Oak Ridge National Laboratery

was requested to consider scaling up the yttrium
preparation process, which was described in the
previous report.* Official approval of the proposed
ORNL program was received at the end of April,
and the preparation of facilities was begun. The

objective set forth for the program was the prep-
aration of ytirium metal containing less than 1000-
ppm O, in 20-Ib ingots.

The equipment for this program, which is installed
in Building 9201-2, Y-12 area, consists of two
parallel 50-1b fluoride purification systems that
supply YF, mixtures to a National Research Corp-
oration 150-lb (rated in steel) vacuum-induction-
melting furnace. A system for transferring into the
furnace the lithium used as the reductant is included
in the installation.

The control panel and furnaces for one of the
fluoride purification systems may be seen in Fig.
1.1.4 beside the vacuum-reduction furnace, which
is in the center of the photograph. The lithium and
fluoride loading ports on the side of the vacuum
furnace may be seen. Another view of the reduction
furnace which shows the control panel for the 100-kw
motor-generator reduction power supply is shown in

1.2. CORROSION
E. E. Hoffman

LITHIUM PURIFICATION
E. E. Hoffman

Various methods have been investigated for the
purification of lithium.! Although the effect of
nitrogen and oxygen contamination of the lithium on
the corrosion resistance of columbium to lithium at
elevated temperatures is not yet well understood, it
is generally felt that oxygen and nitrogen concen-
trations should be reduced to a practical minimum to
eliminate the purity of the lithium as a test vari-
able. A method of reducing the oxygen contami-
nation is also needed in order to produce the low-
oxygen-content lithium required in the production of
low-oxygen-content yttrium (see Chap. 1.1, this
report).

Analyses of lithium from three shipments supplied
by the vendor in gas-tight stainless steel containers
(under an inert gas) are presented in Table 1.2.1.
The specification of less than 100 ppm nitrogen
was, as may be seen, not met by the vendor. Ef-
forts will be made to obtain improved as-received
material, but it is felt that it will probably be nec-
essary to purify all lithium used for tests.

Three different methods have been used for de-
termining the oxygen content of lithium. In order to
provide a comparison of the results obtained by the
three methods, dip samples were taken from approxi-
mately 25 different batches of lithium. These dip

veloped in the ORNL Analytical Chemistry Di-
vision, and (3) a methyl alcohol-Karl Fisher reagent
method developed by the Nuclear Development Cor-
poration of America. Although the agreement of the
results obtained with the three methods was not
good, the best agreement was obtained between the
butyl iodide-iodine method and the activation
analysis method. Improved sampling and analytical
techniques will be employed in the future to further
determine the reliability of these two methods for
determining oxygen in lithium.

Results of preliminary determinations of the solu-
bility of lithium nitride and lithium oxide in lithium
were presented previously,] and one additional
oxide solubility determination has been made for
which an improved sampling technique was used. A
total of five analyses made by two methods by the
Analytical Chemistry Division on samples taken at
250°C showed good agreement. An averaged value
of approximately 1300-ppm oxygen was measured.
This value is considerably below that obtained in
one previous test, and additional work will be re-
quired to resolve the difference.

The purification experiments, described previ-
ously,! in which titanium and zirconium metals
were used as gettering agents for nitrogen and
oxygen in lithium, indicated that although fhesg
metals are effective in removing nitrogen, they do
not getter oxygen from the lithium. In several
tests the oxygen content of the titanium getter foil
actually decreased, as would be expected, inas-
much as lithium oxide is more stable than titanium
oxide. Yttrium oxide is much more stable from a
free energy of formation standpoint than either ti-
tanium or zirconium oxides, and, therefore, tests
are being performed to determine the effectiveness
of yttrium metal as a getter for oxygen in lithium.

A gettering test was conducted in which 88.5 g
of yttrium turnings was added to 628 g of lithium,
The stainless steel container, which had a tan-
talum liner, was held at 1500°F for 72 hr. Yttrium-
metal cylinders (0.3 in. in diameter and 2 in, in
fength} introduced into the purification vessel at
24-hr intervals were analyzed for oxygen and nitro-
gen at the conclusion of the test. The results of

Effect of Welding Procedures on Corrosion

A series of tests was conducted to study the ef-
fect of various Heliarc welding procedures on the
corrosion of arc-cast columbium in lithium. Two
joining techniques and three types of welding en-
vironment were used in weld sample preparation.
The arc-cast columbium stock used was 0,035 in.
in thickness, and it contained, as determined by
chemical analysis, 360-ppm 0,, 20-ppm N,,, and
140-ppm C.

The joints were made by using a fusion welding
technique in which no filler metal is applied or
with a filler metal consisting of an 85% Zr-15% Cb
alloy. Sheet material for the fusion welds was ob-
tained by splitting and flattening 0.5-in.-OD seam-
less tubing. For the welds made with filler metal,
the split tubing was not flattened. Three joints of
each type were made that were prepared in three
different environments. One was made in air with
good, conventional inert-gas (argon) coverage; one
was made in an inert-atmosphere chamber containing
argon gas contaminated with 1600 ppm N, + CO and
400 ppm 02; and the third was made in an inert-
atmosphere chamber containing high-purity argen,
which analyzed 67 ppm N, + COand 3 ppm 0,. All
the specimens were exposed to lithium simultane-
ously in a single columbium container for 100 hr at
1500°F.

The results of these tests are presented in Table
1.2.5. The specimens joined in argon plus air
showed weight losses and those joined in the inert
atmosphere chamber showed weight gains, The
specimens joined with the filler metal showed es-
sentially no attack of the weld metal. The effects
of environment on the heat-affected zone and the
weld metal are illustrated in Fig. 1.2.2. As may be
seen, the heat-affected zone of the columbium ad-
jacent to the braze weld of the specimen joined in
a contaminated environment (air plus argon) was
heavily attacked, but the same zone showed very
little attack when the specimen was joined in a
high-purity argon environment. The base material
was attacked in both cases but to a lesser degree
in the case of the specimen joined in high-purity
argon,

2'

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 1958

The specimens joined by fusion welding were
heavily attacked in both the weld zone and the
heat-affected zone. The attack in these areas de-
creased in both depth and concentration as the
purity of the cover gas increased. The weld zones
are shown in Fig. 1.2.3 after exposure to lithium at
1500°F for 100 hr, The attack was extremely heavy
on the specimen welded in argon plus air. It is
surprising, however, that even with the purest weld-
ing environment the specimen was subsequently at-
tacked by lithium along the grain boundaries. The
introduction of impurities during welding should
have been quite low. The results indicate that
unalloyed columbium must not only be welded under
very pure, inert atmospheres, but that the parent
metal must be quite low in nitrogen and oxygen.

An enlarged photograph of a crack in the weld zone
of the specimen welded in argon plus air is shown
in Fig, 1.2.4. The grain-boundary phase shown in
Fig. 1.2.4 has not yet been identified; it was not
visible in the as-welded specimens prior to the test
in lithium.

As was expected, the hardness values for speci-
mens in the as-welded condition were guite high
when the joining operation was performed in impure
argon because of pickup of interstitial elements
such as oxygen and nitrogen. All test specimens
decreased in hardness as a result of exposure to
lithium, and thus it appears that the lithium gettered
the contaminants responsible for the hardness in-
crease,

The free energies of formation indicate that co-
lumbium nitride is more stable than lithium nitride ?
whereas, lithium oxide is considerably more stable
than columbium oxide. Therefore, lithium metal
would probably reduce any columbium oxide present
as a precipitate in the grain boundaries of colum-
bium welds, but it should not attack columbium
nitride. Specimens selectively contaminated with
nitrogen and oxygen are being tested that were
prepared as described in Chap. 1.1 in order to
identify the contaminant responsible for the cor-
rosion of columbium welds,

COMPARISON OF METHODS FOR DETERMINING
THE NITROGEN CONTENT OF COLUMBIUM

E. E. Hoffman

The validity of the vacuum-fusion method for de-
termining the nitrogen content of columbium has
been evaluated by checking ¥he results against
those obtained with the micro-Kjeldahl method,
Several columbium samples were analyzed by the
Special Analysis Laboratory of the ORNL Ana-
lytical Chemistry Division by both methods. The
results obtained by the two methods were in agree-
ment, as may be seen in Table 1.2.6.

The micro-Kjeldah| method consists of dissolving
a sample of approximately 0.1 g in concentrated
H,S0,, transferring the solution to the Kjeldahl
upparmus, adding NaOH, and distilling the ammonia.
The distilled ammonia was analyzed colorimetri-
cally with the use of Nessler's reagent.

In the vacuum-fusion method, a platinum bath in
a graphite crucible is used for sample dissolution.
The technique used was standard except that pieces
of platinum weighingatotal of about 10g are dropped
into the bath after the samples have been added in
order to thoroughly mix the bath material. In addi-
tion, the columbium metal samples are wrapped in
platinum foil so that when dropped they will sink

MOLYBDENUM AND COLUMBIUM TESTED IN
LITHIUM IN SEESAW-FURNACE
APPARATUS

E. E. Hoffman

A series of dynamic corrosion tests of molybdenum
in contact with lithium were conducted with the use
of a seesaw-furnace apparatus. The test assembly
is shown in Fig. 1.2.5. In the tests, a 15-in.-long
molybdenum pipe (0.80 in. OD x 0.10 in, wall) was
partially filled with lithium, and the molybdenum
pipe was placed inside an Inconel pipe (1.31 in.
OD x 0.07 in. wall). The annular space between
the molybdenum and the Inconel was partially filled
with sodium, The Inconel pipe protected the mo-
lybdenum from oxidation, while the sodium acted as
the heat-transfer bond between the two containers.
The test assembly was then placed in the seesaw
funace, where it was rocked up and down (% cpm)
with the desired temperature gradient between the
ends of the capsule. Hot-zone and cold-zone

specimens were suspended in the ends of the mo-
lybdenum tube, so that weight changes and the
attack in each zone could be determined.

The extruded molybdenum pipes used for the six
tests conducted thus far were made from unalloyed
vacuum-arc-cast material, The specimens sus-
pended in the hot and cold zones were made from
arc-cast molybdenum-titanium alloy sheet, The

analysis of the specimen surface did not reveal any
differences between as-tested and before-test speci-
mens. Test $5-525 was a recheck of test $5-514,
and the weight-change data were in good agreement
with results obtained in the tests at higher temper-
atures. At the present time the anomalous results
of test 55-514 are not understood, and further work
is planned in an effort to explain the previous re-
sults. The ends of the molybdenum capsule and
the hot- and cold-zone specimens from test $5-526
are shown in Fig. 1.2.6, and an enlargement of the
hot zone of the molybdenum capsule is shown in
Fig. 1.2.7. No molybdenum capsule failures have
occurred to date. Test $5-527 was terminated by a
sodium leak through the Inconel protective capsule
wall, and, although the molybdenum capsule was
attacked in the region of the leak, it did not fail.
That the molybdenum capsule did not fail may have
been due to gettering of the available oxygen by
the sodium during the time required for the furnace
to cool. Hot- and cold-zone specimens from test
55-522 are shown in Fig. 1.2.8. Very little, if any,
attack may be detected even at very high magnifi-
cation. The hot-zone specimen partially recrystal-
lized during the test. The cold-zone specimen sur-
face shown in Fig. 1.2.8 is quite similar to that of
the metal before test.

In all these seesaw-furnace tests, some dis-
similar-metal mass transfer from the Inconel pipe
wall to the outer surface of the molybdenum
capsule walls in the hot zone was observed. Mass
transferred crystals were also found on the cold-
zone wall of the Inconel pipe exposed to sodium.
Thermal-convection loop tests of molybdenum-
lithium systems are planned in order to check the
corrosion resistance of molybdenum in a system
with unidirectional flow.

A series of columbium-lithium seesaw-furnace
tests is under way for which a test configuration
similar to that shown in Fig. 1.2.5 is being used.
In the columbium tests, the outer protective cap-
sule is type 316 stainless steel rather than Inconel
as in the molybdenum tests. The columbium tubes
are 15 in. in length, 1.25 in. in outside diameter,
and 0.032 in. in wall thickness. The only test per-
formed to date was terminated after 300 hr by a
sodium leak in the stainless steel pipe. The co-
lumbium tube did not fail as a result of the failure
in the protective pipe. The hot- and cold-zone
specimens were at 1600 and 1100°F, respectively.

20

The hot-zone specimen showed a slight weight
gain (0.1 mg/in.2), which may be attributed to
gettering of residual nitrogen from the lithium,
while the cold-zone specimen showed no weight
change. Further tests are planned at higher tem-
peratures and for longer test periods.

BERYLLIUM EXPOSED TO LITHIUM
E. E. Hoffman

In previous corrosion tests? a beryllium speci-
men in an iron capsule exposed to lithium at 1830°F
for 400 hr showed extensive attack and large weight
losses. Tests have recently been conducted in
iron capsules and in all beryllium systems, and the
results are compared in Table 1.2,8. In the recent
tests, as in the earlier test, the specimen tested in
an iron capsule ot 1830°F suffered extensive solu-
tion attack as a result of dissimilar metal mass
transfer of beryllium from the specimen to the cap-
sule wall. The beryllium in an all beryllium system
showed very good corrosion resistance to static
lithium at elevated temperatures.

The serious effect of dissimilar metal mass trans-
fer on the corrosion resistance of the beryllium is

Metal Corrosion, ORNL-1647 (May 11, 1954).

illustrated in Fig. 1.2.9. The rectangular shape of
the beryllium specimen was altered appreciably in
the test conducted in an iron capsule. The slight
weight gains of the beryllium specimens fested in
beryllium containers are probably due to gettering
of impurities such as oxygen and nitrogen from the
lithium. The surfaces of the beryllium specimens
tested recently at 1830°F are shown in Fig. 1.2.10.
Considerably more porosity and surface roughening
is apparent on the specimen tested in an iron con-
tainer than on the specimen tested in a beryllium
container.

Some indication of the extent of dissimilar metal
mass transfer is illustrated in Fig. 1.2.11. The
Be,Fe intermetallic compound on the surface was
identified by x-ray analysis. This phase has a
hexagonal structure, and its anisotropy is apparent
in the photomicrograph taken with polarized light
(Fig. 1.2.118).

REFRACTORY-METAL-BASE BRAZING ALLOYS
EXPOSED TO LITHIUM

D. H. Jansen

Most commercially available brazing alloys
contain constituents used to alter the melting point,
lower the flow point, increase flowability, or im-
prove the ductility of the alloy. These constituents
include the precious metals, copper, and manganese,
to mention a few. The additives are beneficial for
their specific purposes, but they may produce alloys
that possess limited corrosion resistance to the
liquid metals, especially lithium. A typical ex-
ample, a 60% Mn—40% Ni brazing alloy which failed
completely when exposed to lithium for 100 hr at
1500°F, is shown in Fig. 1.2.12. Analyses of
microdrillings from the remaining alloy fillet indi-
cate that the manganese was attacked to the same
extent as the nickel. Another example, an 86%
Fe-5% Si—5% Cu-4% B brazing alloy on a type 347
stainless steel tube-to-header joint which was
tested in lithium in a seesaw-furnace apparatus for
100 hr at 1500°F, is shown in Fig. 1.2.13. The
copper concentration of the lithium bath after this
test was very high.

As a result of the poor corrosion resistance of
the alloys described above, refractory-metal-base

®wmy with caption)

brazing alloys are being investigated for use in
high-temperature lithium systems, Columbium
tubing (‘/2 in. OD) has been used for capsules in
tests in which small (5 g) brazing alloy samples
(buttons) have been corrosion tested in static
lithium at 1700°F, Conventional methods for
loading and testing the brazing alloys were used.

The corrosion testing program on these refractory-
metal-base alloys has involved, initially, static
tests of zirconium- and titanium-base binary and
ternary alloy buttons. The alloys which appear
promising with respect to corrosion resistance will
be used as a basis for developing other alloys with
lower flow points or better flow characteristics.
(Melting-point and flow-point determinations and
flow-characteristic studies are being made by the
Welding and Brazing Group, see Chap. 1.3.) The
more promising alloys will then be used for brazing
molybdenum or columbium T-joints which will be
given more severe corrosion tests (seesaw-furnace
tests or tests in thermal-convection loops with
brazed sections in the hot legs).

The results for all the refractory-metal-base
alloys corrosion tested in lithium to date are
presented in Table 1.2.9. The alloy button con-
taining vanadium (70% Zr-30% V) exhibited the

It appears therefore that the zirconium and va-

whether the large weight loss is due to mass trans-
fer.

The only alloys that showed severe corrosion at-
tack were the 75% Zr-15% Cr—10% Fe and the 80%
Co-20% Cb (Fig. 1.2.15) alloys. Attack on these
alloys was quite spotty and nonuniform, The in-
homogeneity of the alloy buttons, which may be the
cause of nonuniform attack, is being studied.

Previous static tests on pure cobalt in lithium
under slightly more severe conditions (1832°F for
447 hr) showed intergranular attack and a weight
loss of 7% (0.7 g/in.2). Consequently, the attack
seen on the 80% Co-20% Cb alloy (Fig. 1.2.15) is
understandable, in view of the high cobalt content
of the button.

Titanium-base brazing alloys in button form and
in the form of braze fillets on columbium T-joints
were tested and the results are being evaluated at
present, One titanium-base alloy (72% Ti-28% Co)
on a columbium T-joint tested in 1700°F lithium for
100 hr showed approximately 1 mil of nonuniform
attack on the exposed surface (Fig. 1.2.16),

rosion resistance is decreased when large per-
centages (80%) of cobalt are used.

DETERMINATION OF THE SOLUTION RATE
OF METALS IN LITHIUM®

E. E. Hoffman

A method was developed at NDA for measuring
the rate at which container metals dissolve in
liquid lithium under controlled nonequilibrium con-
ditions.” The method consists essentially of im-
mersing a thin test specimen into a comparatively
large volume of liquid metal held at the desired
temperature in an inert container. With suitable
choices of surface area and immersion time, the

test specimen can be made to lose about 1 mg of
weight in a test period of less than one day. This
weight loss does not significantly increase the
concentration of test specimen material in the
liquid metal, but the loss can be determined with
ample accuracy and precision on a semimicro
balance.

The solution rates determined in this manner are
proportional to the specific solution rate constant,
. Based on experimental evidence from thermal-
convection loop tests, it is believed that inhibitors
and impurities exert their effect on mass transfer
rates by altering the specific solutionrate constant.
Therefore, this method is suitable for preliminary
studies of the effects of additives and impurities
on mass transfer.

The data from fests on stainless steel indicate
that variables can be detected which affect the
initial solution rate by as much as +20%. The re-
sults indicate that nickel-bearing stainless steel
dissolves in lithium at 1600°F at an initially high
rate of 3.0 mg/in.Zshr because of the preferential
leaching of nickel. Within a relatively few hours,
depletion of nickel in the specimen surfaces re-
sults in a rapid decrease in the solution rate to a

27

ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

value of about 0.3 mg/in.2+hr at solute concen-
trations of a few hundred parts per million. It was
shown that this solution rate accounts for the mass
transfer rates observed in thermal-convection loop
tests. The solution rate tests confirm the dele-
terious effects of nitrogen and oxygen and the
beneficial effects of aluminum additions on mass
transfer rates that were observed in thermal-con-

28

vection loop tests. In addition, it appears that
Misch metal and tantalum additions may have
beneficial effects.

Solution rate studies of molybdenum in lithium at
1600°F indicate that this material is not signifi-
cantly attacked by lithium. Tests on niobium
yielded conflicting results which have not been
resolved.

DEVELOPMENT OF BRAZING ALLOYS
FOR LITHIUM SERVICE

R. G. Gilliland G. M. Slaughter

Refractory-metal-base brazing alloys are being
developed for application in high-temperature re-
actors that use lithium as a coolant. As a starting
point, a literature survey was made of the binary
systems of columbium, zirconium, titanium,
tantalum, and molybdenum in order to find eutectics
or minimums in the approximate temperature range
of interest. The data obtained for columbium and
zirconium were presented previously, ! and data for
titanium, molybdenum, and tantalum are summarized
in Tables 1.3.1, 1.3.2, and 1.3.3. Small buttons of
approximately fifty binary or ternary alloys of in-
terest have been prepared for testing by arc melt-
ing, and results of tests of a number of these alloys
in lithium are presented in Chap. 1.2, Corrosion.

A vacuum-tube fumace that has been modified
for ultrashigh-temperature work is being used for
preparing brazed joint specimens for testing. The
furnace and the quartz muffle for use at temper-
atures up to 1200°C are shown in Fig. 1.3.1. A
ceramic muffle made primarily of zirconium oxide
is available for use at 1350°C. Vacuums of less
than 1 u are consistently obtained.

A number of the arc-melted alloys have been
tested for flowability at various temperatures by
using the T-joint sample design with both
columbium and molybdenum as base metals., Flow
points were obtained from these tests, and metal-
lographic examinations of the resulting joints were
conducted. The flow points and general brazing
characteristics of the several alloys tested thus far
are presented in Table 1.3.4.

The brittleness of the brazing alloy in the as-
brazed condition is an important problem in this
study, as may be seen in Fig. 1.3.2, which shows a
brazed molybdenum T-joint that contains numerous
fillet cracks. The brazing alloy used was 84 wt %
Zr and 16 wt % Fe. In comparison, the molybdenum
T-joint brazed with an alloy containing 70 wt % Zr
and 30 wt % V, shown in Fig. 1.3.3, is considered
to be satisfactory,

16, M. Slaughter, ANP Quar, Prog. Rep. March 31,
1958, ORNL-2517, p 35.

A study of the diffusion of brazing alloys on re-
fractory metals has been initiated. Lap joints
made from columbium, and possibly molybdenum,
brazed with the different altoys will be used in the
study, and particular attention will be paid to
brazing alloys containing refractory metals, The
joints will be aged just befow, at, and just above

The selection of structural materials capable of
withstanding service loads at the high temperatures
at which reactors for the propulsion of aircraft will
operate has necessitated determinations of the
basic strength properties of new materials and the
development of accurate and precise analytical pro-
cedures for the evaluation of materials. Equipment
is now available which permits the rapid testing of
materials in controlled environments at temperatures
up to 2500°F. Means for obtaining quantitative de-
sign information on the behavior of metals under
complex states of stress and strain have been
studied, and it has been found that experimental
creep data are in substantial agreement with the
results of calculations based on accepted theories
of creep and fracture.

DEVELOPMENT OF TEST EQUIPMENT

In the development of equipment for studying the
mechanical properties of both metals and nonmetals
in the temperature range from 1800 to 3000°F, it
was necessary to provide control of the test en-
vironment, which would be gas or a vacuum, to
provide control of the temperature gradient and the
temperature fluctuation comparable to that provided

The furnace element currently being used in the
apparatus is platinum, but molybdenum or tungsten
could be used for operation at higher temperatures.
The three elements of the furnace are separately
controlled by Variacs, and temperature deviations
along the gage length can be held to +5°F,
High-purity argon has been used as the test en-
vironment for all of the tests conducted to date.
The apparatus is amenable to evacuation, but the
increased time and trouble involved in vacuum
tests make high-purity inert gases more desirable
as test environments, The reliability of the ap-
paratus has been checked in three tests on mo-
lybdenum specimens at 2000°F, and the results
indicate that a suitable device has been achieved.

MULTIAXIAL CREEP STUDIES
C. R. Kennedy

Analytical studies have been made of creep data
obtained for Inconel tubular specimens in tests in
which internal pressure, as well as axial loading,
was applied in the apparatus described previously.’
The internal pressure required to produce a given
tangential stress was calculated by using the thin-
wall formula. The axial stress was calculated
conventionally, with the axial stress produced by
the internal pressure being taken into consideration.
The average radial stress was obtained by dividing
the internal pressure by 2, After-test measurements
of the tube dimensions were made to determine the
three principal strains at rupture. In those cases
where end effects or bulging occurred, tangential
strains measured at regions of highly localized de-
formation could not be compared directly with the
over-all axial rupture strain in connection with
subsequent data analysis. |t was necessary, there-
fore, to use average tangential strains for this
purpose. These were obtained by averaging five
measurements of the tangential strain taken at
equidistant positions along the 21/2-in.-goge length,
An observation that the sum of the three measured
average strains often was greater than zero sug-
gested an increase in volume during the test, Since
a volume change is inconsistent with the assump-
tions used in the mathematical analysis of creep
flow and fracture, this matter was investigated by

measuring the specific gravities of after-test speci-
mens by using a Jolly balance. In these tests, ob-
served density changes were found to be less than
the sensitivity of the balance, and thus the apparent
volume change based on after-test strain measure-
ments was not real. The error was believed to be
associated primarily with the radial strain measure-
ments and was attributable to the inaccuracies in-
herent in measuring small changes in the sizes of
small sections with curved surfaces. In the data
analysis which follows, the ‘‘measured’’ radial
strains at fracture were determined from axial and
tangential strains based on constancy of volume,

Creep Analysis

A workable formulation for steady-state creep is
that of Soderberg,? which is based upon the follow-
ing assumptions: (1) the material is originally
isotropic and remains isotropic during the creep
process so that the stress effect on creep rates
canbe expressed in terms of the principal stresses;
(2) the principal stresses coincide with the principal
strain directions; (3) the volume remains constant
so that hydrostatic pressure has no influence and
the stress effect must therefore be a function only
of the difference of the principal stresses (that is,
shear stresses); (4) the stress state remains constant
with time; and (5) the effective creep stress, 7,
and the effective creep strain rate, €, for all stress
states at a given temperature are related through
the material constants K and » by the relation
(1) E=KG" .

According to this formulation, the principal steady-
state creep rates are

2¢. R, Soderberg, Trans, Am, Soc. Mech, Engrs, 63,
737 (1941),

where the subscripts Z, 6, and R denote axial, tan-
gential, and radial stress or strain rates, respec-
tively. Based on the assumptions stated, only the
principal stresses and the relation between creep
stress and creep strain for simple tension are re-
quired in order to compute multiaxial creep rates
according to Eq. 2, The value of & depends on the
flow criterion selected to correlate the data. Based
on the von Mises (distortion energy) criterion, it is
given by

1
3) © =———{(az-—08)2+ (ag-oR)2+

V2

and, by the Tresca (maximum shear stress)
criterion, it is given by

(4) g zamax —Omln .

The effective creep strain rate, €, is the creep
strain rate associated with & for a value of uniaxial
stress equal to the calculated effective stress.

The design criterion based on creep rate in many
applications is the time to reach a limiting strain.
For the purpose of comparing experimental results
with those predicted by Eq. 2, the average creep
rate to 2% strain was used. In those cases where
rupture occurred before 2% axial strain had oc-
curred, the average creep rate to one-half of the
total strain was used,

Comparisons of the measured axial creep rates
with those predicted from Eq. 2 by using both the
von Mises and the Tresca criteria are shown in
Figs. 1.4.3, 1.4.4, and 1.4.5. In general, the corre-
lation of the experimental data obtained by using
the von Mises criterion is slightly better than that
obtained by using the Tresca criterion. In most
design situations, however, the stresses are known
only approximately, and, in view of the many inde-
terminate variables which influence creep, the
simpler and more conservative Tresca criterion is
clearly adequate for engineering purposes, The
advantages of using the Tresca criterion for multi-
axial creep have been demonstrated by Wah!? for
the case of rotating disks. According to Wahl, the
use of the von Mises criterion predicted much lower
creep rates than those obtained experimentally.

Rupture Analysis

Rupture data are presented in Fig. 1.4.6 in which
the stress ratios calculated by the thin-wall formula
are plotted against the rupture life. The rupture
data are also presented in the form of 100-, 500-,
and 2000-hr isochronous fracture envelopes in Fig.
1.4.7. The envelopes were obtained from cross
plots of the data shown in Fig. 1.4.6. The 100-hr
fracture envelope predicted by the maximum princi-
pal tensile stress criterion is also plotted in Fig.
1.4.7.

It may be seen that the results calculated and
plotted in the manner described show deviations
from the simple maximum principal stress criterion.
There are, however, at least two important factors
which should be considered in a realistic analysis
of the data, Both of these factors involve in some

manner the changes in stress state associated with
deformation of axially loaded pressurized tubes.
The first factor is concerned with the stress-state
changes in uniformly deformed tubular specimens.
For an equivalent amount of strain under these con-
ditions, the increase in the axial stress is less
than the increase in the tangential stress over the
entire range of stress ratios studied. For example,
after 10% axial strain in a specimen tested in
simple tension the '‘true’’ axial stress becomes 1.1
times as great as the original axial stress; however,
after 10% outer-surface tangential strain of a speci-
men subjected to tangential stress only, the aver-
age tangential stress becomes 1.18 times as great
as the original tangential stress, For this example,
the increase in the tangential stress is greater than
that of the axial stress by a factor of 1.07. This is
to be compared with the data plotted in Fig. 1.4.7,
where it is shown that the axial stress required to
produce rupture in 100, 500, or 2000 hr is greater
than the corresponding tangential stress by a factor
of about 1.25. This discrepancy can be rationalized,
however, by noting that the effect being considered
is intensified by the second important factor which
is associated with localized deformation or bulging,
particularly in tension-compression states,

The relative amounts of bulging are demonstrated
in Fig., 1.4.8, which is a plot of the difference in
the maximum and the average tangential strain at
rupture versus the stress ratios. It is shown that
the bulging between stress ratios of « to ‘/2 is
insignificant; however, the extent of bulging in-
creases substantially as the stress ratio drops
from ‘/2 to ~1. The result of this bulging, if only
the increase in diameter of the specimen were con-
sidered, would be to increase the tangential stress,
which is the maximum principal stress in this
range. The relation between the degree of bulging
and the deviation of results from the maximum
principal stress criterion may be seen by comparing
Figs. 1.4.7 and 1.4.8. For example, in Fig. 1.4.8
the degree of bulging obtained by testing at 3000
psi is shown to be less than that obtained by
testing at 4000 and at 6000 psi. This is consistent
with the rupture results presented in Fig. 1.4.7,
which show that the deviation of the 2000-hr frac-
ture envelope from a vertical line representing a
maximum principal stress criterion is much less
than that for the 500- or 100-hr curves (vertical
reference lines not shown). Accordingly, the re-
sults of this study appear to support the maximum

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 1958

principal stress criterion for time-dependent frac-
ture under multiaxial stress conditions. It has
been shown, however, that in applying this cri-
terion it is important to compensate for the re-
duction in rupture life caused by changes in the
stress state associated with deformation,

The role of the maximum principal stress is dem-
onstrated by crack patterns (Fig. 1.4.9) on the out-
side surfaces of specimens. A close inspection of
these patterns reveals that the cracks propagate in
a stair-step manner, and, in all cases, the general
direction of the intergranular cracks is normal to
the maximum principal stress, |t was observed that
all cracks were intergranular and that none of the
specimens exhibited necking prior to failure,

The effect of multiaxial stress states on the
rupture elongation was also investigated. Fracture
strains based on after-test measurements of speci-
mens tested with a 4000-psi maximum principal
stress are shown in Fig. 1.4.10, in which the aver-
age axial, tangential, and radial strains are plotted
versus the stress ratio. The strain at failure, €/,
for tests with the same maximum principal stress
appears to be related to the deviatoric stress in the
following way:

f ' 06+0R
ALY

f OZ+09
(o5

A comparison of these relationships with the data
in Fig. 1,4.10 indicates good agreement, The value
of B is constant for all the stress states tested
with the same maximum principal stress, but it
varies with the maximum principal stress, as shown
in Fig. 1.4.11. The rupture strains from all tests
are compared with Eq. 5 in Fig. 1.4.12, which is a
plot of the ratio of rupture strains to the axial strain
for simple tension vs the stress ratio, Again, there
appears to be good agreement with Eq. 5.

under simple tension is also plotted against stress
ratio in Fig. 1.4,12, This shows that specimens
which obey Eq. 5 with the same maximum stress in
the tension—~tension stress state fail with the same
shear strain regardless of rupture life, Thus, for
specimens of this type, the rupture strain in the
tension—tension state is a function of the maximum
principal stress only, It should be realized that al-
though the total elongation in a particular direction
may be less under combined tension—tension
stresses, the shear strain or total deformation at
rupture is the same.

Specimens tested in the tension—compression
stress state cpparenfly can sustain a much greater
shear strain before fracture than those in the
tension—tension state. As shown in Fig. 1.4.12,
specimens tested under pure shear sustained twice
the shear strain at fracture as the specimens tested
in simple tension,

STRAIN-FATIGUE STUDIES
R. W. Swindeman

Many of the failures encountered in engineering
devices result from dynamic loads which are im-
posed on the structure either mechanically or
thermally. Most often, fatigue failures are con-
sidered to be the result of rapidly fluctuating
stresses which introduce damage in the material
on a very microscopic scale. Thus in low-tempera-
ture fatigue, no bulk plastic straining of the metal
can be discerned. However, at elevated tempera-
tures, where relaxation of stress can occur, meas-
vrable amounts of plastic strain may be induced

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 1958

during each stress reversal. This is particularly
true in the case of restrained structures when they
are subjected to large thermal fluctuations, Quite
often, under such conditions, the thermally induced
stresses occur over relatively long time cycles and
are large enough to exceed the elastic limit of the
metal. Thus, in studying the behavior of materials
loaded in this manner it is more meaningful to think
of the metal as experiencing a number of strain
reversals which ultimately lead to failure, rather
than to attempt to base such failures on the inde-
terminate stress state,

Recent studies have revealed that the plastic
strain history of a metal under dynamic load con-
ditions provides extremely useful data for calcu-
lating the metal life consumed and the service life
remaining under expected operating conditions.
This idea was conceived by Manson? and then dem-
onstrated experimentally by Coffin® by thermally
cycling stainless steel under conditions of restraint
until failure occurred. The relationship between
plastic strain and cycles to failure was found to be
of the form N%€_ = K, where N is the cycles to
failure, € _is the strain per cycle, and @ and K are
constants which depend on the material and test
conditions.

Most of the subsequent work has been within the
temperature range where the rate of work hardening
was appreciably greater than the recovery rate.
The work described below concerns metals at tem-
peratures where creep and relaxation are the domi-

are dominant in the temperature range of interest
made it both feasible and attractive to substitute
mechanical loads for thermal fluctuations as a
means of producing strain cycles. The apparatus
used is described in detail in a separate report.’

Most of the investigation was conducted with
Inconel as the test material; but, a few tests were
made with Hastelloy B and with beryllium, Thus,

of cycles to failure are shown in Fig. 1.4.13, The
co-ordinates were plotted on logarithmic scales so
that if Manson’s relationship N®¢, = K were satis-
fied, the data points would define a straight line,
It is apparent that this condition is satisfied for
each material, but it is also evident that there is a
variation in the slope of the line from one metal to
another, These slopes are approximately —0.58 for
Hastelloy B, —0.76 for Inconel, and —0.81 for be-
ryllium. Such values are in contrast to the findings
of Coffin’ who shows ato be very nearly ~0.5 for
several different metals tested at temperatures be-
low 1200°F,

It has also been noted that for any given material,
K can be varied by changes in the metallurgical
structure. A plot of the strain-cycling properties of
Inconel rod specimens machined from the same heat
but differing in the annealing treatment given before
the test is presented in Fig. 1.4.14. The specimens
annealed at 1650°F had a finer grain size and were
much more resistant to fracture than the specimens
annealed at 2050°F, Comparative data for rod ma-
terial at 1300, 1500, and 1600°F, which was re-
ported previously,® indicate that grain size effects
are most pronounced at 1500 and 1600°F; however,
at 1300°F coarse- and fine-grained material have
nearly identical strain-cycling properties, Inconel
is a solid-solution type of alloy that is not subject
to phase changes or aging reactions, and therefore
the difference in behavior seems to be clearly de-
pendent on the relative grain size, It is also note-

worthy that the two lines are parallel, and thus the
a value is consistent for both types of specimens,

The question of whether specimen geometry seri-
ously affects the strain-cycling properties also
merits consideration. The strain-cycling properties
at 1500°F of rod and tube specimens are compared
in Fig. 1.4,15. Tube data fall slightly below the
rod data, but this may be attributed to two factors.
First, the methods of sensing failure are ditferent;
the tubes are considered to fail when the first
crack propagates through the wall, whereas rods
are tested to complete failure. Further, the rod
specimens have a slightly finer grain size than that
of the tube specimens. The tube data include test
results from two different heats of metal, and the
agreement indicates that the cycling properties are
not particularly sensitive to small variations in
alloy composition.

Temperature Dependence

One of the most important considerations in regard
to test variables is the influence of temperature on
the number of cycles to failure. This is particularly
important where it is desired to apply isothermal
mechanical strain-cycling data to design problems
where thermal cycling is involved. The results for
tests at 1300, 1500, and 1600°F that were con-
ducted to determine the effect of temperature are
presented in Fig. 1.4.16. The band represents the
scatter of points obtained in an extensive program
of tests of tubes and rods at 1500°F, Nearly all
the data for rods at 1300°F and for tubes at 1600°F
fall inside this band. The rod data obtained at
1600°F fall consistently above the band because of
the grain size effect mentioned previously. It ap-
pears, therefore, that within this particular range
there is no major change in fracture behavior as a
function of temperature. The fact that Inconel is
metallurgically stable, that no grain growth occurs,
and that the deformation mechanism is uniform
throughout this span are important points to bear
in mind when considering these results.

Since temperature appears to have no major influ-
ence on the number of cycles to fracture in the
range 1300 to 1600°F, it would appear reasonable
to expect mechanical strain cycle results under iso-
thermal conditions to correlate with those obtained
by thermally cycling about a corresponding mean
temperature. Data illustrating the validity of the
assumption are presented in Fig. 1.4.17. The
thermal excursions about the 1300°F mean covered
the range from 1000 to 1600°F. At the 1500°F

mean the temperature extremes were 1400 and

1600°F, It is evident that in the absence of metal-
lurgical instabilities a metal responds to the me-
chanically produced strain in the same manner as
to a strain thermally induced.

Frequency of Dynamic Loads

A very important variable to be considered in
studying the effect of dynamic loads on the be-
havior of metals at elevated temperatures is that of
frequency. It is well known that the test frequency
can be changed over a wide range without preducing
a marked effect on the plot of stress vs number of
cycles to failure (S-N diagram) in low-temperature
fatigue tests. On the other hand, several investi-
gators have found that frequency does exert an in-
fluence on the cycles to rupture at high tempera-
tures. This is especially true at lower frequencies
where creep or relaxation may occur. Hyler® has
conducted fatigue studies on Inconel at 1200 and
1600°F at load frequencies of 60 and 600 cpm. He
observed essentially no difference in the S-N dia-
gram at 1200°F, but he found an appreciable fre-
quency effect at 1600°F. Specimens cycled at 600
cpm endured 10 times more cycles than those cycled
at 60 cpm. Fatigue studies on lead have yielded
similar results. Dolan? reports data for reversed
flexure fatigue tests on lead at room temperature for
frequencies of 1, 6, 44, and 248 cpm. Curves re-
lating the strain per cycle and the number of cycles
to rupture were determined for each frequency. A
comparison of the curves revealed that the cycles

to rupture increase with increasing frequency. Un-
fortunately, the strain values ranged only from 0.1
to 1% and the reported strains include both elastic
and plastic components. Since plastic strain per
cycle was not determined in any of these studies,
the direct use of these data for studying the fre-
quency effect on the strain-cycling behavior is not
possible. The results raise the question, however,
of whether or not the difference in the plastic strain
absorbed could explain the variation in properties
with frequency. Since plastic strain is generally
considered a reliable measure of damage to a
structure, it would appear that specimens strained
within the same limits of plastic deformation should
survive an equivalent number of cycles before
fracture, regardless of the rate at which the strain
is introduced. Design problems involving tempet-
ature fluctuations are, however, often concerned
with slow thermal cycles, and therefore a series of
tests to investigate frequency effects was initiated.

The majority of the data previously discussed was
obtained by using a constant load; thus the creep of
the specimen continued until the limiting strain
condition was reached in the desired time interval.
This type of test is quite easy to regulate for short
time cycles, but the prescribed load required to
produce specific strains in 10 or 30 min is diffi-
cult to obtain, Thus a slight modification of the
equipment was made to provide adjustable, but
rigid, reference limits.® In test, the specimen is
strained to the selected limit very rapidly and held
at this strain for the selected time interval, During
this period the elastic strain is gradually converted
into plastic strain by the relaxation process, It is
therefore quite simple to control the frequency and
to vary it from times as short as l/2 min per cycle
up to whatever time cycle seems practical, A com-
parison of results obtained by the creep method and
by the relaxation method is shown in Fig. 1.4.18,
Since creep and relaxation are manifestations of
the same deformation phenomena, the excellent
correlation shown between the results of the two
types of tests was expected.

The data from a series of tests at 1500°F in
which the standard 2-min/cycle period was used
are compared in Fig. 1.4.19 with data from tests in
which a 30-min/cycle period was used. At high
percentages of plastic strain per cycle, good corre-
lation exists, but a significant deviation is shown
for the low strain values. Data obtained at 1650°F
with a 30 min/cycle period follow a trend similar
to that found at 1500°F, but at 1300°F, as shown

in Fig. 1.4.20, the only test point which falls out-
side of the 2 min/cycle data occurs below 1% strain,
and, even here, the deviation is not appreciable.

There is, of course, considerable engineering
interest in the fact that for the same amount of
repeated plastic deformation, a metal subjected to
slowly fluctuating loads will survive for only a
fraction of the cycles of a specimen cycled more
rapidly. This is especially important since the
frequency appears to exert the greatest influence
for values of strain below 2%, which are also equi-
valent to the thermal strains most often encountered
during service, There is no evidence to indicate
that the longer thermal exposure encountered in the
low-frequency tests is detrimental, so it must be
concluded that the mechanisms controlling fracture
at high temperatures are strongly influenced by time
as well as plastic flow.

Period.

Design Factors

This investigation of the high-temperature be-
havior of metals under dynamic loads reveals the
following significant points.

1. The relationship, NOLE!J = K, holds for several
metals at elevated temperatures provided the cycle
time is relatively short. The exponent, o, is de-
pendent on the material and varies from —0.58 to
—0.81. Since the strain-cycling curves of many

48

metals have exhibited a slope of —0.5 in low-tem-
perature tests, the greater slopes at high tempera-
tures indicate a dependence on temperature or
deformation mechanism rather than directly on ma-
terial composition. Since there is no significant
variation in a for Inconel over a 300°F range, it
appears that the deformation mechanism is the
major factor that affects the slope of the strain-
cycling curve for Inconel. Thus, there may be a
break in the strain-cycling curve similar to the one
observed for the equicohesive temperature in creep.
The K factor is changed significantly by changes
in grain size, and thus it is believed that the dis-
placement of the rupture curve can be attributed

to metallurgical changes.

2. Metals respond in the same manner to plastic
strain whether it is introduced by thermal changes
or mechanically imposed loads. This statement
must be qualified to the extent that the deformation
mechanism and metallurgical structure must not be
altered by the temperature fluctuations.

3. The rate at which strains are reversed has a
marked effect on the number of equivalent strain
cycles a metal can survive. This phenomenon,
which is apparently confined to the high-temperature
region, establishes the fact that plastic deformation
is not the sole mechanism controlling the fracture
life of a metal.

SYNTHESIS OF ZIRCONIUM BORIDE
R. A. Potter

Small batches (approximately 200 g each) of zir-
conium boride continved to be synthesized in the
laboratory for additions to beryllium oxide control
samples. Some improvement has been made in the
synthesis process' by adding kerosene to the
batch. The zirconium silicate-boron carbide-
graphite reaction was expedited and carried to
near completion by the presence of the hydro-

carbons resulting from the ignition of the kerosene.

Several batches of ZrB, were semiquantitatively
analyzed by spectrographic methods, A typical
batch is >97% pure, with silicon being the pre-
dominant impurity.

DENSIFICATION OF BERYLLIUM OXIDE
R. A. Potter

Seven different compositions, given in Table
1.5.1, were mixed in a jar on rolls for 18 hr, and
the material was then pressed at 20,000 psi in
stee| dies, broken up, granulated by passing
through a 30-mesh screen, and remixed for 2 hr,
Right-cylinder shapes approximately 3‘/4 X 3/4 in.

were made by pressing the materials at 15,000 psi.
These shapes were then fired to six different tem-
peratures (1650 to 1900°C in increments of 50°C).
The furnace consisted of an induction-heated
graphite tube with a positive flow-through of
helium. In each case a fast firing schedule of
approximately 2 hr was used.

Screening tests indicated that composition 2 was
superior to the others with respect to density. The
densities of this body at the six test temperatures
are compared with those of the 100% BeO control
sample in Table 1,5.2.

Magnesium oxide alone, as in composition 3,
acted as a densifier, but at about 1700°C it began
to volatilize rapidly and caused distortion of the
shape of the cylinder. At 1650°C the density of
composition 3 was found to be 2.9 g/cm?; how-
ever, there was a slight distortion in the shape.

For a further test, composition 2 was pressed
into right cylinder shapes approximately ]3/8 x 1 in.
in height. Forming pressures on these pieces were
6,000 and 10,000 psi. The slugs were fired in an
oxidizing atmosphere to a temperature of 1500°C.
Densities of these samples were in the range
2.67 to 2.75 g/cm>. Density values for similar

100% BeO control samples were 2,02 to 2.04 g/cm3,

Specimens in the shape of bars approximately
5x 'll/4 X 3’/4 in. have been fabricated for additional
testing.

OXIDATION RESISTANCE OF
BORON-CONTAINING BERYLLIUM
OXIDE BODIES

R. L. Hamner

Screening tests were also run to determine the
oxidation resistance of hot-pressed boron-contain-
ing BeO bodies being considered for GE-ANPD
applications. The oxidation characteristics of
the mixtures tested are compared in Fig. 1.5.1.
The additives TaB, (9.35 wt %) and BN (2.29 wt %)
not only have poor oxidation resistance above
1000°C but also apparently have very volatile
oxidation products, Ta, O, and 8,0, which ac-
count for the comparatively large weight losses.

It was expected that the BeO-CrB, body would
show an over-all weight loss upon oxidizing, be-
cause the oxides of chromium, Cr203 and Cr03,
tend to be volatile. A green deposit adjacent to
the specimen indicated that a chromium oxidation
product slowly volatilized along with the B,0;
an over-all weight loss was detectable after about
125 hr at 1300°C.

The borides of Ti (2.31 wt %), Zr (5.22 wt %),
and Hf (9.25 wt %), had good oxidation resistance
when incorporated in dense BeQ, as evidenced
by appearance and over-all weight changes, with
the ZrB,-BeO and HfB,-BeO combinations being
slightly better than the TiB,-BeO combination. It
is not known why the HfB,-BeO compact lost
weight despite the known stability of the oxida-
tion product, HfO,.

The thermal stability of ZrB, in air during long-
term oxidation testing at 1300°C is illustrated in

density was tested with the ZrB,-BeO compact to
give a more complete picture of weight changes
involved, since BeO is somewhat volatile in the
presence of water vaporat 1300°C, X-ray and
chemical analyses showed the boron to be present
after the long-term oxidation test. There was not
sufficient ZrO, present as an oxidation product to
be detectable by x-ray analysis,

Information was received during this reporting

in this laboratory for BeQ development work. |t
was, therefore, necessary to establish fabrication
characteristics of a new material representative
of future supplies; Brush's G. C. grade BeO, which
is derived from the sulphate and calcined at ap-
proximately 1100°C, was received for this purpose.

Specimens of G. C. grade BeO and BeO contain-
ing 5.22 wt % of laboratory synthesized ZrB, were
hot pressed at temperatures of 1550, 1650, and
1750°C under a pressure of 2000 psi for 15 min,
The G. C. grade of BeQ was found to be much
more reactive than the Luckey S. P. grade; notice-
able compaction began at approximately 250 to
300°C lower (at about 1250°C). This difference
in reactivity of the two materials can be explained
by the difference in grain size, as shown by elec-
tron photomicrographs, Figs, 1.5.3 (S, P. grade)
and 1,5.4 (G. C. grade).

Densities of pure BeQ obtained at 1550, 1650,
and 1750°C were 92, 95, and 98%, respectively.
Densities obtained for the BeO-ZrB,, mixture were
approximately the same for all the temperatures,

being 96.7, 96.4, and 96.4%, respectively; thus
ZrB,, appears to be somewhat effective as a densi-
fier at the lower temperature. Above 1750°C a
rather vigorous reaction occurred between the
ZrB,-BeO mixture and the graphite die, the attack
being severe enough to prevent removal of the
piece from the die.

Attempts were made to fabricate large hot-
pressed blocks of the ZrB-BeO mixture, 3 x 3 x
1 in., for physical and mechanical properties meas-
urements. A commercial grade of ZrB,, was used
because of the large quantities of boride involved.
Upon cutting the blocks, which were pressed at
1550°C and 2000 psi, an irregularity in color was
noted that was roughly in the shape of a “bow-
tie’’ and which approximated the temperature profile
of the piece in the graphite die. The top and center

defect. It was not eliminated by time-temperature
variations, although it was less pronounced at
lower temperatures.

Analysis of the ZrB, revealed a large quantity
of iron (approximately 10%). When iron-free ZrB,
was used, either laboratory synthesized or an
acid-treated commercial grade, the appearance was
uniform, as illustrated by the bottom specimen

1.6. NONDESTRUCTIVE TESTING

REMOTE X-RAY VIEWING
J. W. Allen R. W. McClung

Further studies were made of the use of x-ray
sensitive Vidicon' in a closed-circuit television
system for remote viewing of x-ray images. As
reported previously, the sensitivity of the present
selenium photoconductor Vidicon system is con-
siderably less than that which can be obtained
with existing film techniques. The primary ad-
vantages of this system (in contrast to those con-
sisting of closed-circuit television applied to
fluoroscopy) are the inherent high resolution,
which approaches the resolution attainable with
a fine-grained radiographic film, and the inherent
magnification of images.

Recently it was discovered that the sensitivity
of the selenium photoconductor to x-radiation could
be improved in many situations by admitting visible
light to the photoconductor surface. Although the
phenomenon is not well understood, it appears that
the sensitivity is increased merely by raising the
level of total incident radiation, including both
x-radiation and visible light. This effect is readily
observable and has been used to increase the con-
trast sensitivity by as much as a factor of 3. The
wave length of the enhancing light does not seem
to be critical, as evidenced by the use of both
white fluorescent lamps and incandescent lamps
as the light source.

By using this light-enhancing technique, thick-
ness changes of about 2,5% can be detected in
s/a-in.-fhick aluminum. This indicates that practical
inspections could be accomplished at contrast
sensitivities of 5 to 6%. Although this figure is
considerably lower than that attainable with film
techniques, it compares favorably with those pub-
lished for other television systems which use
fluorescent screens.

Further investigation of the light-sensitizing
technique is planned. In addition the use of photo-
conductor materials other than selenium is being
studied.

DUPLEX TUBING
R. W. McClung

The increased interest in the fabrication and use
of duplex tubing has created a need for adequate

inspection techniques for this configuration. The
problems which are common to the inspection of
conventional tubing, such as dimensional gaging
and the detection of cracks, seams, laps, and other
discontinuities, are also present in duplex tubing.
In addition, an evaluation must be made of the

bond quality between the layers, and measurements

should be made of the individual layer thicknesses.

To detect the more common discontinuities, the
conventional techniques? of encircling-coil eddy-
currents, pulse-echo vltrasonics, radiography,
fluorescent penetrants, and visual inspection
should be adequate for complete evaluation. Also
some of these techniques may provide methods for
determining some of the properties peculiar to
duplex tubing. The use of the pulse-echo ultra-
sonic technique has detected the presence of lami-
nations in welded and drawn tubing.3 The detection
of such laminations is probably dependent upon
the size and location of the lamination, the ultra-
sonic frequency, and the dimensions of the tube.
At present, not enough is known about the mecha-
nism of detection of these laminations to assure
a high level of confidence in their detection under
all conditions. Many of the areas of nonbonding
will resemble simple laminations, and, under
proper conditions, may be located by the pulse-
echo ultrasonic technique.

If a gross separation exists between layers,
radiography may offer a means for detection, either
as a function of the decreased metal thickness due
to the voids when passing the radiation perpen-
dicularly through the lack-of-bond, or by observing
the poor bond in profile with the radiation passing
tangentially through the separation between layers.
However, as the separation between layers de-
creases, the confidence level of such an examina-
tion decreases rapidly.

The resonance ultrasonic technique is being
evaluated as a means for the detection of non-
bonded areas. This technique has been used in

the past to measure wall thickness. On duplex
tubing with a well-bonded interface, the total wall
thickness of both layers would be indicated as a
function of a fundamental or harmonic resonance of
an ultrasonic frequency. Under proper conditions,
if a lack of bonding exists, this indicated thick-
ness would be that of the clad or outside layer
only. However, to achieve this detection of non-
bonding, it is necessary to make a careful selec-
tion of frequency range and calibration to avoid
confusion of indications.

A few small batches of duplex tubing have been
examined to determine the bond quality. These
include approximately 14 ft of 0.504 x 0.042 in.
tubing and 24 ft of 0.375 x 0.036 in. tubing. These
lots were fabricated by cladding about 0.025 in. of
low-carbon steel on types 304 and 347 stainless
steel, respectively. Radiography, resonance ultra-
sonics, and pulse-echo ultrasonic tests revealed
the presence of gross discontinuities in the
0.504-in.-dia tubing. Metallographic sectioning of
several typical defects revealed considerable lack
of bonding, with gross voids and separation pre-
valent. The worst bond condition detected is
shown in Fig. 1.6.1. The transverse cracks seen

in Fig. 1.6.2 are probably responsible for the

many indications noted in the pulse-echo ultra-
sonic examination. The same ultrasonic and
radiographic techniques as those used on the
0.504-in.-dia tubing, when applied on the 0.375-in.-
dia tubing indicated the presence of a good bond,
similar to that shown in Fig. 1.6.3. The resonance
ultrasonic technique seems to provide an evalua-
tion for bond quality which is the best and most
consistent of any of the current techniques. Addi-
tional development effort is needed and will be
made to provide a high level of confidence for the
complete evaluation of duplex tubing.

of the vacuum-tube model. The MIM-Mark 1I, shown
in Fig. 1.6.4, is 7% x 3% x 2% in., and it weighs
approximately 20 Ib, representing an 80% reduction
in size and weight.

In developing the transistorized model, several
changes were made which greatly increased its
versatility. These are: (1) the instrument has
been made truly portable by the incorporation of a
battery power supply, (2) the range of metals identi-
fiable has been expanded to include all ferromag-
netic and nonferromagnetic metals, (3) the effec-
tive depth of penetration of the eddy-currents has
been decreased by increasing the operating fre-
quency and thereby reducing the minimum metal
thickness necessary for accurate identification,
and (4) the diameter of the probe coil has been de-
creased to reduce the error produced when a flat
reference standard is used in conjunction with the
identification of a specimen having a curved sur-
face.

A block diagram illustrating the internal opera-
tion of this instrument is shown in Fig. 1.6.5. The
frequency of the probe oscillator is determined by

the inductance of a probe coil, which, in tum, is
determined by the conductivity and permeability of
the specimen. The frequency of the tuning oscilla-
tor is controlled by the dial on the front of the
instrument. The signals from these two oscillators
are heterodyned to produce a signai having a fre-
quency equal to the difference of the frequencies

of the two original signals, The designs of the
amplifier and detector are such that only signals
of a narrow band of frequencies, centered about
120 kc, will be amplified, detected, and presented
on the meter,

Since the eddy-current flow in a specimen is a
function of its conductivity, magnetic permeability,
and geometry, it is possible by controlling geom-
etry factors to utilize the conductivity or con-
ductivity and permeability characteristics of a
metal as identifying features. This is accomplished
by tuning the instrument for @ maximum meter de-
flection with the probe on a reference standard.
The difference frequency between the two oscil-
lators is then 120 kc. If the probe is then placed
on a specimen having a different conductivity or
permeability, the frequency of oscillation of the
probe oscillator will shift so that the difference
frequency between the two signals is no longer
120 kc and the meter will no longer indicate a
maximum. |f the difference between the metals
is great enough, the meter will cease to indicate
altogether,

The response of this instrument to changes in
conductivity in nonferromagnetic materials is
illustrated in Fig. 1.6.6. The dial settings 565,
545, and 495 represent the tuning dial settings
that were necessary to obtain maximum meter
deflection when the probe was placed on samples
of Hastelloy B, Inconel, and type 316 stainless
steel, respectively. It is evident that, if the
instrument is tuned with the probe on the Inconel
sample (dial setting 545), the instrument will not
respond when the probe is placed on the other
two samples. [t can also be seen in Fig. 1.6.6
that the slight variations of conductivity normally
found among samples of the same alloy will not ap-
preciably decrease the meterreading from a maximum.

Il to Conductivity Changes as a Function of

Response of Metal Identification Metere

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 1958

It is important to note that this instrument cannot
be used to separate two nonferromagnetic metals of
differing composition which have the same conduc-
tivity or overlapping ranges of conductivities. Ac-
curate identification can only be made when it is
known that none of the metals in the group to be
identified have the same or overlapping conductivi-
ties. A similar problem is encountered in identify-
ing ferromagnetic materials, since different com-
binations of conductivity and permeability can
produce the same instrument response.

Variations in the geometry of a specimen can
adversely affect its identification when a thick,
flat reference standard is used. The extent of the
error produced by the curvature variations on the
surface of a specimen is illustrated in Fig. 1.6.7.
For all practical purposes an item may be con-
sidered to present a flat surface to the probe if
its radius of curvature is greater than 1.5 in.
Variations in the thickness of the specimen will
produce an error in identification only if the speci-
men is thinner than the effective depth of the eddy-
current penetration, which varies with the con-
ductivity and permeability of the part and the
operating frequency of the probe oscillator.

The variations in meter reading caused by thick-
ness variations of a specimen can be used as a
measure of thickness. This has been satisfactorily
accomplished in the gaging of 3/4 x 0.05 in. type
304 stainless steel tubing with an accuracy of 2'/2%.

This instrument can also be used to separate
specimens from the same heat of an alloy which
have been subjected to different mechanical and
thermal treatments, since they produce changes in
the conductivity and in some cases the magnetic
permeability of the part. [n addition, this instru-
ment can be used to locate cracks normal to the
inspected surface, since they interrupt the eddy-
current flow and cause an apparent conductivity
change in the part.

RESULTS OF METALLOGRAPHIC EXAMINATION
OF SMALL SEMICIRCULAR FUSED-SALT
FUEL-TO-NaK HEAT EXCHANGER
OPERATED AT HIGH TEMPERATURES

R. J. Gray J. E. VanCleve

A metallographic examination has been com-
pleted of a 20-tube semicircular heat exchanger
fabricated of Inconel in which a fused salt flow-
ing around the tubes exchanged heat to NaK flow-
ing in the tubes. Details of the construction and
operation of this Inconel heat exchanger were pre-
sented previously.'*? Testing of this heat ex-
changer was terminated after 1139 hr of high-
temperature operation at 1200°F and above because
of a leak of NaK into the fused salt. At the time
of termination the heat exchanger had operated at
design conditions for 258 hr with a temperature
differential from fused-salt inlet to outlet of 350°F
(1600 to 1250°F) and a temperature differential
from the NaK inlet to outlet of 430°F (1070 to
1500°F). There had been 142 hr of operation under
transitional conditions and 739 hr of isothermal
operation. The heat exchanger had experienced
194 thermal cycles between isothermal operation
at 1200°F and operation at design conditions.

The general area of the failure was readily
located after the shell was removed because of a
change in the color of the fluoride salt from green
to gray in the NaK outlet header region. The gray
material ignited during sectioning of the header,
and the presence of NaK mixed with the fluoride
salt was thus evident.

Two of three fractured Inconel tubes found in
the high-temperature header area are shown in
Fig. 1.7.1. The cracks were radial and were in
the so-called ““tension” side of the tubes. The
cracks were found in the tubes with shortest tube
beﬂd-'o-?ube sheet length. This length ranged
from 1) % to 3/ in. The side of the tube that cracked
was in fms:on because of the temperature differ-
ence between the tube and the shell.

PREPARATION OF CHARGE MATERIAL FOR
REDUCTION TO YTTRIUM

G. J. Nessle

A pilot plant has been constructed that will
provide for the monthly production of about 200 Ib
of massive ytrium metal. The Chemistry Division
is responsible for the preparation of the suitable
fluoride mixture, either LiF-Mng-YF3 or LiF-YF,,
and the Metallurgy Division will carry out the re-
duction, distillation, and sparge-melting steps that
will yield the final product. The pilot plant was
completed during August, and the first batch of
fluoride-salt mixture (LiF-YF,) has been prepared.
Phase equilibrium studies of the LiF-YF, system,
as reported below, have indicated a single eutectic
with 19 mole % YF , that has a melting point of
682°C. Therefore an attempt will be made to
prepare low-oxide-content yttrium from this binary
mixture and thus eliminate the Mg-Y alloying step
and subsequent distillation of Mg from the alloy
that would be required if the LiF-MgF ,-YF_ mixture
were used, If this attempt is unsuccessful, it will
be necessary to revert to the ternary system. The
metal reduction operation is described in Chap. 1.1
of this report.

Conversion of Y,0, to YF,
J. Truitt
About 400 Ib of YF, was produced by direct

hydrotluorination of dry Y,0, in a large-scale
(250-1b capacity) converter. In addition, about

100 Ib of YF, was produced in a small, pilot-scale
unit (10 Ib per batch). These units are operated at
approximately 1100°F, and the raw material is
treated for about 10 hr with HF. Analyses of the
batches produced in the pilot-scale unit are given

in Table 2. 1.1,

Preparation of MgF,
J. Truitt

No satisfactory grade of MgF . was available
commercially, and therefore six 10-lb batches of
MgF , were prepared by dry hydrofluorination of
MgO. Previous results had shown that by extended
treatment at 600°C a product of better than 99.5%

could be obtained. However, extended hydro-
fluorination is not economically desirable if, as

was later shown, 95% assay material is satisfactory
for charging to the final molten salt purification
step. The range of product analysis and conversion
efficiency of the six batches is given in Table 2,1.2.
It is now possible to purchase a satisfactory grade
of MgF, and sufficient material has been ordered

for several months of operation.

salt purifications was used on the ternary mixture
in order to test the new method of oxide deter-
mination in fluoride salts and to determine the
reproducibility of oxide removal.

The analytical results obtained for ten batches
are presented in Table 2.1.3. Petrographic and
x-ray diffraction examination of these mixtures
did not detect oxides. As can be seen from the
data, however, the chemical analyses indicated
approximately 1000-ppm oxygen in the salt, There
is some reason to believe that the oxide analyses
gave high results because of sampling techniques,
but, on the basis of these analyses, the hydro-
fluorination time will be increased gradually until
a product purity of 500-ppm oxygen or less can be
assured.

Extending the hydrofluorination will have a
marked effect on the processing time per batch of
mixed salt because there will be increased dis-
solution of the reactor vessel, usually nickel, and
of the accumulated impurities left from previous
batches. Therefore, care must be taken to use only
the HF needed in order to prevent the processing
time (or cost per batch) from becoming unrea-
sonable, if possible,

Determinations of the character of the phase
equilibria occurring in the system LiF-YF have
been deterred by the presence of considerable

66

amounts of a phase which is probably an oxyfluoride
of yttrium, This phase appears as a biaxial
negative material with an optic angle of 10 deg,

and it has refractive indices just above and below

1.700.

All samples of YF, used previously had been

prepared by solid-state hydrofluorination of Y,0,.

R

ecently a LiF-YF, batch was hydrofluorinated in

the liquid state in order to minimize the content of
the oxyfluoride., This batch was subsequently
analyzed chemically and used as the beginning

m

aterial for several thermal-gradient quenching

experiments, The quenched samples from these
experiments were apparently free of oxygen-
containing phases. The quench results are thus
believed to be more nearly representative of

L

iF-YF, equilibria than any results previously

available, A portion of the phase diagram of the
system has been constructed from these results
and is shown in Fig. 2.1.1. A single eutectic
occurs in the system at 19 mole % YF,; mp,
682°C. This melting temperature is lower than
any of the values previously reported, ! and it

is believed to be the most accurate value yet
attained.,

EXTRACTION OF LITHIUM METAL IMPURITIES
WITH MOLTEN SALTS

G. M. Watson J. H. Shaffer

A tentative procedure for purifying lithium metal
by extracting oxide, nitride, and carbide impurities
with a eutectic mixture of lithium halide salts, such
as LiF-LiBr (12-88 mole %; mp, 453°C) or LiF-LiCl
(20-80 mole %; mp, 485°C), was described pre-
viously.? The effectiveness of the method depends
on the differences in solubilities of impurities in
the salt and metal phases. Indirect measurements
in this laboratory indicate that the solubility of
Li,O is relatively high (over 1 mole %) in molten
salts. The solubility of the oxide in liquid lithium
is not known, however, because of difficulties en-
countered in sampling and analysis, even though
some progress has been recently reported? in the
determination of oxygen in lithium,

It is expected but not necessarily assured, how-
ever, that the differences in the solubilities of the
impurities in the salt and metal phases are
favorable toward their accumulation in the salt
phase and that a suitable extraction method for
lithium purification may be developed.

Five experiments were performed on two different
batches of lithium in attempts to gain familiarity
with the procedure and to determine whether a cor-
relation could be obtained between the number of
extractions on a given batch of lithium and the
amounts of impurities extracted. The results of
these experiments are summarized in Table 2.1.4.

No particularly good correlation has been obtained
to date between the number of extractions performed
on a given batch of lithium and the concentration of

impurities extracted. |t is true that the second ex-
traction in each of the series shows a considerable
lowering in concentration of the impurities extracted
as compared with the initial concentration; however,
the concentration of 50 ppm shown is probably in
error, since in this experiment a considerable
amount of bismuth-lithium alloy was trapped in

the salt. Substantial corrections determined by
measuring the hydrogen evolved from the salt when
treated with water had to be applied. Thus the
value of 50 ppm was obtained as the net result

of the difference between two relatively large
numbers. Accordingly this result can be dis-
counted for the present. The result of the third
extraction of batch number 1 appears to be

totally due to nitrogen impurities, as given by
chemical analysis of the salt. It is not immediately
apparent why no oxygen was found (by difference)
unless the analytical results for the nitrogen
determination are erroneous.

For future experiments greater care will be
exercised in minimizing contamination in the
experimental assembly. Also the lithium metal
will be heavily contaminated with known amounts
of oxide, introduced as CuQ, in order to attempt to
determine on a much firmer basis whether the
partition coefficient for the oxide extraction is
favorable for the accumulation of impurities in
the salt phase.

Recent improvements in analytical techniques
have made it feasible to analyze lithium samples
before and after the salt extraction, and it is no
longer necessary to depend entirely on the complex
procedures required for analysis of the salt phase.
The liquid lithium samples will be obtained as
emulsions of lithium in paraffin.

DETERMINATION OF OXYGEN IN
FLUORIDE SALTS

A. S. Meyer, Jr. G. Goldberg

The method for the determination of oxygen in
fluoride salts by fluorination with KBrF ,, as de-
scribed in a previous report, was applied success-
fully to determinations of oxygen in the mixed salt
LiF-MgF -YF ;. Seven salt mixtures were analyzed
during this period. The results for duplicate
samples are presented below:

Sample No. Oxygen Content (%)
Al 0.11, 0.11
A2 0.21, 0.22
A3 0.11, 0.10
A4 0.11, 0.10
AS 0.14, 0.15
Aé 0.24, 0.26
A7 0.11, 0.13

The coefficient of variation of the results is 6%.
Since Sheft, Martin, and Katz? had reported that
KBrF, was too basic to react with sufficient satis-

faction with an oxide as basic as MgO and had
recommended the use of an acidic addition com-
pound, SbF BrF2, for such oxides, the validity of
the results ?or oxygen in LiF-MgF ,-YF , was cor-
roborated by analyzing standard samples of MgO and
Y,0,. The recovery of oxygen from these oxides
exceeded 98% with excellent precision (coefficient
of variation, 2%). Highly refractory MgO, however,
did not react appreciably with KBrF .. The method
described is now being used for routine determi-
nations of oxygen in the mixed salt and also to
determine the extent of conversion of oxides of
magnesium and yttrium to the fluorides.

DETERMINATION OF YTTRIUM AND
MAGNESIUM IN LiF-Mng-YF3

J. P. Young R. F. Apple

A potentiometric method for the determination of
both yttrium and magnesium in LiF-MgF ,-YF . was
developed and evaluated. Yttrium and magnesium
form stable complexes with ethylenediaminetetra-
acetic acid (EDTA) and can be determined by direct
titration by applying the technique of Reilley and
Schmid,® who use a modified mercury electrode. The
electrode system is essentially an amalgamated
gold wire as the indicator electrode and calomel as
the reference electrode.

Both yttrium and magnesium are determined in the
same sample because of the difference of the
stability constants of their respective EDTA com-
plexes. Yttrium, the more stable complex, is
determined at a pH of 4.0 £ 0.5. Then the pH of the
sample solution is increased to 9.7 £ 0.3, and
magnesium, the less stable complex, is determined.
An example of the resultant titration curve is shown
in Fig. 2.2.1. When titrating yttrium and magnesium
with 0.01 M EDTA, at least 5 mg of yttrium and at
least 1 mg of magnesium should be present in order
to obtain a satisfactory potential break at the end
point. Although macro amounts of iron, nickel, and
chromium would definitely interfere with these
determinations, the method is quite insensitive to
the micro amounts of these corrosion products that
would be expected in routine samples of LiF-

MgF -YF .

Up to approximately 400 ug of fluoride ion can be
tolerated in the sample solution without affecting
either determination. The titrations can be per-
formed in either a nitrate or sulfate medium; large
concentrations of chloride ion interfere with the
response of the mercury electrode. Typical results
for the determination of yttrium and magnesium in
synthetic standard sample solutions which con-
tained nitric or sulfuric acid are given in Table 2.2.1.

3C. N. Reilley and R. W. Schmid, Anal. Chem. 30,
947 (1958).

The precision of the method is about 1%. The
results of these determinations are accurate to with-
in 2%. This method is considerably less time-
consuming than the gravimetric methods that were
previously used for the determination of these
metals. The procedure has also been applied to
the determination of yttrium in yttrium oxide and in
yttrium fluoride.

Solid State Division

ETR IRRADIATION OF MODERATOR MATERIALS
FOR USE AT HIGH TEMPERATURES

W. E. Browning, Jr.
R. P. Shields J. E. Lee, Jr.

Experimental apparatus is being prepared with
which to test the stability of yttrium hydride and
beryllium oxide at temperatures up to 1800 in
the high-level irradiation environment of the Engi-
neering Test Reactor (ETR), where the gamma-ray
heating is approximately 25 w/g. Temperature
gradients will be induced in the specimens, and the
reactor programing will provide thermal cycling.

The yttrium hydride samples will be checked for
changes in crystal structure, as well as for the
effects of stresses resulting from temperature
gradients.

Before the samples of the moderator materials are
irradiated, x-ray examinations will be made of the
yttrium hydride samples in order to determine the
crystal structures, the modulus of elasticity and
shear modulus of each sample will be measured,
marked regions on the samples will be photographed,
and exact measurements of the pieces will be made.
The radioactivities of the samples should be low
enough for the examinations and measurements to be
repeated after irradiation.

The heat generated in the irradiated capsules will
be conducted across a small annulus by a helium-
argon or a helium-nitrogen mixture which will be
essentially static as far as heat transfer is con-
cerned. There will be just enough flow to permit
changing the mixture in order to maintain a constant
temperature at the outside surface of a capsule.
Helium has about four times the heat transfer
capacity of argon and will make up the largest part
of the gas mixture.

Since the intensity of gamma-ray heating in the
reactor is uncertain it is necessary to provide means
for raising the experimental equipment to a region of
lower gamma-ray intensity if the heating is found to
be too great. In order to accommodate the necessary
raising devices, the apparatus for the initial experi-
ment will include only one yttrium hydride and one
beryllium oxide capsule.

The beryllium oxide sample will contain three
right cylinders 0.636 in. in diameter and 1 in. in

70

height. These will be placed end to end in a type
410 stainless steel capsule. The yttrium hydride
sample is similar, but the diameter of each cylinder
is 0.800 in. and the cylinders will be enclosed in
type 430 stainless steel. The yttrium hydride
cylinders and the steel capsule prior to assembly
are shown in Fig. 2.3.1. As may be seen, one
cylinder, which will be at the top of the assembly,
has a weil for a thermocouple with which to monitor
the central temperature. The top beryllium oxide
cylinder temperature will be monitored similarly.

The assembled capsules and the tubes which pro-
vide the gas annuli are shown in Fig. 2.3.2.
Thermocouples will be attached to the sides of the
capsules midway between the ends. In order to pass
these thermocouples through the thin gas annulus,
sheathed, swaged magnesia thermocouple leads will
be silver soldered into the small metal plugs shown
in Fig. 2.3.2. The thermocouples will be spot-
welded to the capsule. Flexibility in the thermo-
couple wires where they pass through the gas
annulus will be provided by helical coils.

After the outer tube assembly is completed, it will
be encased in an aluminum spacer that will provide
a ]/] -in. water annulus and will also anchor the
sheathed thermocouple leads and gas tubes. The
spacer unit will then be fitted into an aluminum tube
which will be attached to a 1-in.-dia stainless steel
pipe. This pipe, which will extend to a point about
10 ft above the ETR lattice, will support the experi-
mental apparatus. All thermocouple leads and gas
lines will be inside the pipe and will leave the
reactor cell through a 1-in.-dia flexible steel tube
that will connect with the support tube and the
flange on the reactor. The steel cable attached to
the support pipe and a drum near the reactor flange
will provide the means for raising the apparatus to
a position of lower gamma-ray flux if the termperature
becomes too high.

The design work on the thermocouple installation
was the major developmental effort required for this
experiment. Each thermocouple must be capable of
operating at a high thermal stress in the gas annulus.
Also, the sheath which encloses the leads and is
sealed at the junction with the tube that forms the
gas annulus must be capable of withstanding the
high pressure of the reactor cooling water.

A series of mockup devices was used in designing
a thermocouple arrangement and developing the
technique for installing the thermocouples, and the
operating conditions were simulated as nearly as
possible in the mockup tests. The mockup used to
test the thermocouples is shown in Fig. 2.3.3. The
heating element (bottom of Fig. 2.3.3) is a 10-mil-
wall Inconel tube attached to copper electrodes. At

900°F, approximately 2 kw of heat can be conducted
from this element across the 10-mil annulus to a
water jacket. The thermocouple wires are spot-
welded to the heating element, and the Inconel
sheath containing the wires extends through a small
cap which anchors the sheath to the water jacket.
Cycling the heating element from room temperature
to 900°C flexes the thermocouple wires; the life of

the thermocouple is a function of the number of such
cycles. It was found that annealing the wires after
removing the sheath and before bending them greatly
increased the life.

This mockup device also served to develop a
temperature control method. With argon flowing
through the annulus at a very low rate, a Moore
controller, activated by a thermocouple, introduces
helium into the argon in varying amounts to increase
or decrease the heat conductivity of the gas.
Varying the conductivity of the gas mixture allows
a constant temperature to be maintained on the out-
side of the capsule although considerable changes
in gamma-ray flux may take place.

The compatibility of yttrium hydride and beryllium
oxide with various probable encapsulating materials
was also investigated. The materials tested were
Inconel, nickel, and types 446, 430, and 410 stai
less steel. An Inconel capsule containing yttrium
hydride that was heated for 200 hr at 900°C showed
no attack. However, when a second capsule was
tested at 1000°C, the Inconel reacted with the
hydride, and o large opening was formed in the
capsule in a matter of 10 to 15 hr. The stainless
steels mentioned were all satisfactory and the final

selection was made on the basis of most favorable
machining, welding, and heat properties. At the
present time the apparatus for the experiment and a

reactivity mockup required for the ETR critical
facility are being assembled.

The first MTR tube burst tests ' were carried out
in a helium atmosphere. The short times to rupture
were attributed to thermocouple errors arising from
contamination of the helium atmosphere by thermal
insulation. A second series of tests have now been
completed in an air atmosphere in the MTR, and the
resultant data are being evaluated. Equipment is
being constructed for operation of tube burst tests
in the lattice of the ORR and for carrying out creep
rate experiments on the pool side.

RADIATION EFFECTS IN ELECTRONIC
COMPONENTS

Wide-Range Multipurpose Cryostat
0. E. Schow

In conjunction with studies of the effects of radi-
ation on semiconductor barriers, a cryostat has been
constructed with a temperature range of ~200°C to
+350°C. Requirements, other than the temperature
range, were long-term reliability and ‘‘fail-safe’’
operation, that is, cooling water failure or electrical
failure should shut the cryostat down without
harmful effects to any of the system components.

The cryostat consists of concentrically nested
metal ‘*cans,’’ suspended from the top, as shown in
Fig. 2.3.4. The innermost container, the sample
chamber, is in two sections. The part which
actually holds the sample is a 4-in.-ID copper
cylinder having %-in. walls. The bottom of the
cylinder is c|ose3 with Y -in. copper plate recessed
2 in. from the end. This recessed bottom is neces-
sary to reduce the heat loss through the bottom of
the cylinder. The over-all length of the copper
section is 12 in., of which 10 in. is available for
use. The open end of this section is silver-soldered
to a 4-in.-ID stainless steel cylinder, 14 in. long,
having 0.019-in. walls. The stainless steel

cylinder is, in turn, attached to a brass plug which
bolts to the suspension plate. The entire sample
chamber, along with its associated thermocouples
and heaters, is completely removable for servicing.
Around the sample chamber and separated from it by
a ]/2-in. heat-exchange-medium chamber is the liquid-
nitrogen cooling jacket. This jacket is filled
automatically and provides the heat sink for the
sample chamber. Around the cooling jacket is a
]]/2-in.-high vacuum chamber to isolate the system
from the ambient temperature. The brass suspension
plate is supported by the outermost container, a
I/B-in. wall, stainless steel cylinder, 30 in. high.

Each chamber, with the exception of the liquid-
nitrogen cooling jacket, is connected by means of
holes in the suspension plate to a gas-and-vacuum
manifold panel, from which it is possible to intro-
duce vacuum, any desired gas, or air into each
chamber. These operations may be performed
independently or simultaneously. The system is
monitored by gages with which it is possible to
determine pressures in the chambers from 2 atm to
10~% mm Hg. Also connected through this panel is
a mechanical roughing pump to reduce the system
pressure sufficiently to prevent damage to the
diffusion pump.

The diffusion pump for the system is a water-
cooled 300-liter/sec fractionating pump. Silicone
oil is used to prevent pump damage if the system
goes to atmospheric pressure while the pump is on.
This pump is suspended below the cryostat and
connected through the outer cylinder by means of a
4-in. ‘‘O’'-ring-sealed flanged joint.

The diffusion-pump cooling coil and the boiler coil
are connected to a monitoring and control panel.
Loss of water pressure, reduction of water flow, or
failure of electrical power will automatically initiate
an emergency shutdown. The pump cannot be started
again until corrective measures have been taken.

Temperature control of the cryostat is effected by
means of a Speed-O-Max ‘“‘PAT’’ temperature con-
troller. This controller uses, as reference, one of
seven thermocouples which have been embedded in
the copper section of the sample chamber and held
there by copper amalgam. Heat is applied to the
sample chamber by means of five heaters wound
around the chamber. The total electrical input to
this heater system is controlled by the controller,
but separate adjustments can be made to determine
what portion of the total electrical power goes to
each heater. Temperatures in the sample chamber

Grown-Junction Silicon Diode Irradiation

J. C. Pigg C. C. Robinson
0. E. Schow

An experiment has been performed to determine the
effect of fast-neutron radiation on a grown-junction
silicon diode. The facility used for the irradiation
was the same as that used for bombardment of a
point-contact silicon diode and an alloy-junction
silicon diode so that comparisons of the three types
of diodes would be possible. The sample studied in
this irradiation was 1.6 ¢m long, 5 mm wide, and
5 mm thick. The junction was about 8 mm from the
end of the p side. The sample was ground and
carefully etched. Nickel was plated to the ends,
and lead wires were attached. It was then placed
in a glass container which was evacuated, flushed
with helium, and filled to a pressure of ]/2 atm with
helium. The leads and thermocouple wires were
brought out through Kovar seals.

The irradiation was performed in hole 51 of the
ORNL Graphite Reactor. This hole is a fast-flux
facility with a fast flux of about 8.3 x 10!
neutrons/cm?.sec when the reactor is at 3500 kw.
The flux is proportional to the power level. The
facility is water-cooled to maintain a temperature of
about 23°C. Because the sample was not in
intimate contact with the side of the facility, its
temperature during the irradiation rose to 33°C. The
irradiation was begun with a reactor power of 100 kw,
which was raised to a maximum of 2100 kw. At this
power the fast flux was approximately 5 x 101!
neutrons/cm2.sec. To further assure bombardment
by fast neutrons only, the sample was wrapped in
several layers of 4.5-mil cadmium. A bias of 1 v
was applied in the forward and reverse directions
alternately, and the current was measured.

A rapid increase in forward current and a small
decrease in reverse current which occurred during
the very early part of the irradiation is illustrated
in Fig. 2.3.5, that is, up to about 5 x 1013
neutrons/cm?. Although not shown conclusively,
experience with previous irradiations indicates that
this may possibly be attributed to photo-emf's pro-
duced in both the sample and in the lead wire
insulation by the gamma-ray flux of the reactor.

From the dosage of about 1 x 10" to about
1 %103 neutrons/cm?, the changes in the reverse

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 1958

current may be attributed to the increase in temper-
ature. |nasmuch as the temperature levels off after
1x10'3 neutrons/cm?, while the reverse current
continues to increase, this change in reverse current
is believed to be the result of radiation. The
irradiation was terminated at 1.8 x 10'® neutrons/cm?
because the ratio of forward to reverse current had
reached a magnitude which suggested other studies
of the sample.

A preliminary comparison of the results of this
irradiation with those of previous irradiations? show
a change in this sample on the order of a factor of
100 increase in reverse current as compared with an
increase of 200% for a comparable irradiation of an
alloy-junction diode and an increase of 30% in a
point-contact diode.

Low-Temperature Indium-Germanium Alloy

J. C. Pigg C. C. Robinson
0. E. Schow

During some preliminary work on the problem of
alloying indium into germanium for the purpose of
making electrical barriers, some heretofore un-
familiar phenomena were noted. This portion of the
work dealt with attempts to alloy at temperatures
which were not greater than 280°C. On a phase
diagram this temperature represents a concentration
of indium of about 5%. Alloying times were on the
order of 15 min to 1 hr, with additional 10-min
periods to bring the samples to temperature and
10-min periods to cool the samples to room temper-
ature. Inasmuch as no continuous time-temperature
recordings were taken, it would be difficult to
estimate the cooling rate of the sample as it passed
through various significant temperatures, that is,
the eutectic or the freezing point of the indium. |t
is believed, however, that the thermal inertia of the
heater would prevent extreme, 50°C/min or faster,
temperature changes. The alloying was carried out
in a helium atmosphere.

After the alloying cycle, the major part of the
indium was removed by careful cutting, and the
remainder of the sample was etched in nitric acid
only. This served to remove the indium without
significantly attacking the germanium. Microscopic
examination of the surface showed no major amount
of penetration of the indium into the germanium;

indeed, most of the surface appeared to be un-
touched. (Microscopic examination of germanium
etched with nitric acid alone does show some attack,
but the action is slow and does not compare with

the action of nitric acid on the indium and is not
believed to detract from the phenomena observed.)

In the areas where penetration was noted, it was
seen to be, for the most part, penetration which
conformed to rather precise geometric configurations.
Some of these may be seen in Fig. 2.3.6. Geometric
crystal growths on the surface of the germanium may
also be seen. Other examples are shown in Fig.
2.3.7. The sample shown in Fig. 2.3.7 is not the
same as the one shown in Fig. 2.3.6. On still
another sample, well-defined triangular *‘screw
growth’’ was seen. In one instance, a pyramidal
crystal was growing from the bottom of a hexagonally
sided pit. The pyramidal and triangular shapes of

76

the growths and pits might be attributed to the
crystal structure of indium, but it is suspected that
such growths would have been removed by nitric
acid.

Hexagonal pits and growths might be attributed to
the germanium. If so, a pit in germanium conforming
to the shape of the germanium crystal would not be
expected unless the germanium had been dissolved
by the indium and the resulting mixture removed by
the nitric acid. This leads to speculation about the
action of nitric acid on different mixtures of germa-
nium and indium. Triangular pits which seem to be
progressing towards a hexagonal shape can also be
seen in the photographs. The spotted or ‘‘dusty’’
surface of the germanium is thought to be a result
of the previously mentioned action of nitric acid on
germanium.

It is well known that indium-germanium alloy
junctions do not result in an even mixing or diffusion
of one metal into the other. Recrystallization of
single crystal germanium on the indium side of the
barrier has been seen, and the irregularity or
“raggedness’’ of the junction is still a problem to
those interested in junction preparation.

Examination of germanium alloy transistors by the
above technique, that is, removal of the indium by
nitric acid, shows a number of indentations in the
germanium surface, but they are not of a geometric
configuration. Other samples show no significant
pits, but the surface is smoothly curved. The pits
of these commercial units may be due to entrapped
gas, and, if so, it could be said that the slight
curvature of the surface is a result of more complete
melting than in samples alloyed at low temperatures.
Since a considerably higher temperature is involved

in the preparation of the commercial units, it may
be that samples alloyed at low temperatures indicate
the beginning of the alloying process, that is,
penetration takes place at some particular spot on
the germanium surface in a disordered region of
some sort such as, perhaps, a dislocation or an
etch pit. Since etching rates along crystal faults
are different than on a normal surface, the prefer-
ential attack might be limited to a crystal fault
inherent in the crystal or introduced by cutting and
not removed by etching. Such a conclusion does
not appear to be completely unfeasible, since it is
known that ““screw growths”’ occur at crystalline
faults. If such is the case, it would lead to specu-
lation about alloying indium into germanium which
has been ground and lapped but not etched. Further
speculation would suggest that recrystallization of
indium-germanium alloy junctions begins from these
growths.

The germanium used in this work was n-type, and
it had a resistivity of approximately 2 ohm/cm,
which is not extremely different from that of com-
mercial units. Before alloying it was etched in
CP-4, washed in distilled water, and kept in ethyl
alcohol until used. The indium was lightly etched
in nitric acid long enough to produce a shiny
surface, washed in distilled water, and stored in
ethyl alcohol until used.

78

Examinations of the samples after exposure to air
for a period of 1to 2 weeks showed that the pits
and growths had undergone some change. They were
still on or in the germanium, but the edges had been
rounded as if they had been lightly etched. Another
sample kept in ethyl alcohol for a period of two
weeks showed no changes in the shape or sharpness
of the pits and growths.

IRRADIATION TEST OF OIL-LUBRICATED
PUMP ROTARY ELEMENT

D. L. Gray

The device which consists of the rotary element
of an oil-lubricated pump and which is installed
in a gamma-irradiation facility in the MTR canal,
as previously described, ! has continued to operate
with downtime limited to 20 min as a result of a
power failure and 1 hr as a result of a low=lube-oil-
flow alarm. As of August 19, the lower bearing
and seal area had received a total gamma-ray
dosage of 8.9 x 107 r, and, by September 30, a total
gamma-ray dosage of 1 x 1010 ¢ is expected, A
large oil reservoir is used with this type of rotary
element and thus only a small portion (about 2%)
of the lubricant (Gulfcrest 34) is exposed to radi-
ation at any time. The average gamma-ray dosage
to the total quantity of oil in the lubricating system
is therefore expected to be about 2.2 x 108 ¢ by
September 30.

Insofar as can be ascertained, the operation of
the seal has been comparable to that of a seal op-
erated without irradiation for a similar period of
time. The leakage of oil from the seal into the
catch basin has usually been at a rate of 5to 7
ml/day, although higher rates have been observed
for short periods from time to time. Results of

analyses of samples of oil taken from the test equip-
ment at periodic intervals are presented in Table
3.1.1.

The viscosities of both the bulk and the leakage
oil have increased but not deleteriously so, as
indicated by operation of the apparatus, The in-
crease in the bromine number indicates that irradi-
ation has displaced some hydrogen atoms from the
hydrocarbon molecules, also without noticeable
effect on operation. The acidity number indicates
very little contamination of the system.

TEST OF NoK PUMP WITH
FULTON-SYLPHON SEAL

D. L. Gray

A sump-type centrifugal pump designed to operate
at a shaft speed of 1200 rpm and to circulate NaK at
1200°F at a rate of 1200 gpm was modified to in-
clude a Fulton-Sylphon seal and placed in test
operation as described previously.? During more
than 7500 hr of operation, the oil leakage past the
test seal, which separates the lubricating oil from
the pump tank helium cover gas, has been of the
order of 10 cm? per week, which is exceptionally
small for a seal of this type. The similar upper
seal, which separates the lubricating oil from the
atmosphere, has been equally satisfactory.

CAVITATION TESTS OF
CENTRIFUGAL PUMPS

P. G. Smith W. E. Thomas

One of two pumps being tested, as described
previously,? to study the effect of operation in the
cavitation region was stopped because of leakage
of NaK from the system drain valve, This sump-
type centrifugal pump had circulated NaK in the
temperature range of 1200 to 1450°F for 2136 hr
at a flow rate of 645 gpm, a pump speed of 2700 rpm,
and a pump tank cover gas pressure of 2.5 psig. At
the time of termination of the test, the pump had
been operating under cavitation conditions for
1096 hr. The pump appeared to be in good con-
dition after the test; there was no evidence of
cavitation damage, The data accumulated during
this period are being analyzed.

A similar pump that is being operated with a fused
salt as the pumped fluid has logged more than
10,300 hr of continuous operation at 1200°F, in-
cluding about 8200 hr under cavitation conditions.
The oil leakage from the lower seal that separates
the lubricating oil from the pump tank cover gas has
averaged 10 cm>/day during the past six months.
Seal leakage from the upper seal that separates

THERMAL STABILITY TESTS
OF METAL SHELLS

J. C. Amos R. S. Senn

A third thin-shell model was tested under high-
temperature thermal cycling conditions similar to
those previously imposed on two other thin shell
models.?*> This shell had the same geometry as
those used previously, but it was fabricated by
welding over-size sections and reducing the shell
to final dimensions by machining the weldment.

Testing of the third shell was continued beyond
the scheduled 300 thermal cycles to 602 thermal
cycles. At this point the test was terminated be-
cause of a test loop failure. There was no indication
that the loop failure was in any way associated with
the test shell. The shell is currently being examined
for dimensional changes, and it will be metal-
lurgicaily examined for effects of thermal cycling on
the welds,

STUDIES OF THE EFFECT OF THERMAL-STRESS
CYCLING ON STRUCTURAL MATERIALS

J. J. Keyes A. |. Krakoviak

Experimental studies of the effect on Inconel of
surface thermal-stress cycling in a fused.salt en-
vironment (NaF-ZrF -UF ,, 56-39-5 mole %) were
continued with the use of the high-frequency pulse-
pump loop.! In order to obtain data for comparison
with data obtained in the University of Alabama
bulk thermalcycling studies? and to establish the
frequency dependence of cycles to crack initiation,
tests 9 through 11 were conducted at a pulse fre-
quency of 0.1 ¢cps and test 12 at 1.0 cps. Tables

3.2.1, 3.2.2, and 3.2.3 present summaries of the
operating conditions and results for these runs. The
wall thicknesses of the Inconel specimens used for
these tests were selected to give just perceptible
temperature fluctuations at the outside surface.
Further, as seen from Table 2.3.3, tests 9 through

11 constitute a comparison of the effect of exposure
time (or total number of cycles) for nearly equiv-
alent stress conditions at a given frequency.

cracks in the central region of the test section of
test 9 is presented in Fig. 3.2.2, Finally, Fig.
3.2.3 presents a comparison of photomacrographs of
equivalent fransverse sections (near the exit) from
tests 9 and 10. The effect of the total number of
cycles of exposure (72,000 cycles in test 9 and
27,000 cycles in test 10) on crack depth is apparent
in Fig. 3.2.3. The deepest crack resulting from
test 9 was 0,207 in, deep, and there were many
cracks as deep as 0,120 in, {n test 10, however,
with only slightly more than ]/3 the exposure, the
maximum crack formed was only about 0.100 in.
deep, and most of the cracks were 0.012 to 0.020 in.
deep. A further decrease to a total exposure of
9,000 cycles (test 11) resulted in no cracking.

84

Test 12, the first of a series extending the fre-
quency range of these studies, was terminated at the
end of 100 hr (360,000 cycles). Post-operation ex-
amination showed no cracking of the test section.

A cross comparison of the available lower-frequency
data indicates a 0.012- to 0.020-in. average (0.100-

in. maximum) crack depth at 0.1 ¢ps and only 0.003

in. at 0.4 cps for the same strain and approximately

the same number of cycles of exposure.

Estimates of the stress on the inside wall fibers
and the corresponding strain per one-fourth cycle,
€, are presented in Table 3.2.3. In these esti-
mates, allowance was made for tube-wall curvature,
but a linear temperature gradient through the wall
was assumed. The quantity, €, is plotted as a
function of the cycles of test duration in Fig, 3.2.4
in an effort to summarize the results of this investi-
gation; the experimental data are differentiated as
to cyclic frequency. The point of incipient ma-
terial failure was chosen as the appearance of the
first discernible cracks on the basis that the ma-
terial had been weakened and that application of a
design load could lead to rupture. An arrow attached
to the data point and pointing to the right indicates

that no cracks were observed and that failure would
be expected to occur only after longer exposure.
Conversely, an arrow pointing to the left indicates
that the observed crack depth was such that initial
cracking occurred earlier in the exposure. Thus, the
incipient failure point occurs, for a given strain,
somewhere along a horizontal line between the
oppositely directed arrows. In only one case was a
run (test 6) terminated at the condition of incipient
failure. At the lowest strain (0.058% at 1 cps), no
cracks were observed for N = 360,000; a longer test
is in progress. For comparison, Fig. 3.2.4 also
shows experimental mechanical fatigue data ob-
tained at ORNL by Douglas and Swindeman at a
cyclic rate of 1.0 cps. The limits on their data
represent the maximum and minimum strain to which
the samples were subjected during a cycle. It is
recognized that a similar range applies to the data
of this study; however, uncertainties in temperature
make it impossible to accurately estimate this
range. In general, although the data are limited,
there is indication that, for a given strain per cycle,
failure occurs at fewer cycles with surface thermal
cycling than with mechanical cycling.

LIQUID-METAL HEAT TRANSFER EXPERIMENT
G. L. Muller® H. W. Hoffman

The initial phase of the studies of liquid-metal
(mercury) forced-circulation heat transfer with in-
ternal heat generation and no heat transfer through
the walls of the tubing has been completed. The
purpose of this investigation has been to provide
not only experimental information useful in the de-
sign of systems containing internally heated circu-
lating liquid metals but also to test the heat-
momentum transfer analogy used in the theoretical
treatment of this problem. Further, since heat was
not transferred through the walls, the results were
unaffected by interfacial resistances, such as
gaseous films or scale, and a direct check could be
made of the “‘interface thermal resistance’ theory
postulated to explain the reduced values of the ex-
perimentally measured Nusselt modulus when heat is
transferred through a pipe wall.

couples were located at the positions B in this
figure. Power was supplied for electrical resistance
heating of the mercury at 5 v and 1900 amp, maxi-
mum. The 60-cycle frequency of the power supply
ensured a uniform current distribution with radius
(uniform radial volume heat generation). Axial
variation of the heat generation as a result of the
temperature dependence of the mercury electrical
resistivity was neglected, since the variation about
the mean was estimated to be only +2%, Heat
losses from the heated section were minimized by
guard heating and insulation.

layer region. A typical set of fluid- and wall-
temperature measurements is given in Fig, 3.2.8.
The results are presented graphically in Fig, 3.2.9

Fig. 3.2.9. Comparison of Theoretical and Experimental
Temperature Differences for Mercury Heat Transfer with
Internal Heat Generation and No Wall Heat Transfer.

The maximum deviation of the data from this corre-
lation is approximately +35%. An error analysis
indicates that most of the observed deviation occurs
in the measurements of the small radial temperature
differences.

This investigation thus shows differences between
theory (based on the Martinelli heat~momentum-
transfer analogy in which a, the ratio of the dif-
fusivity of momentum to the diffusivity of heat, is
assumed to be unity) and experiment similar to
those observed in wall heat-transfer studies with
liquid metals. Since anomolous wall effects®
could not influence the experimental results, it is
concluded that the diffusivity ratio is somewhat
smaller than 1 for mercury.

vortex generator used are shown in Fig. 3.2.10. In
the forced-vortex® generator (3.2.102) the air enters
through a small orifice and is given a rotary motion
by the spiral ramp. The vortex is further accelerated
by a converging cone |located immediately before the
test section. In the free-vortex generator (Fig.
3.2.106) fluid is introduced through numerous, small
tangential inlets distributed along the tube length.
With equal and constant pressure drop across each
inlet, the incoming fluid cannot be displaced by
fluid from an upstream inlet. Thus, in proceeding
downstream, the fluid is forced to rotate through a
progressively decreasing radius with progressively
increasing tangential velocity.

The result of experiments with these two generators
are given in Figs, 3.2.11 and 3.2.12. In these plots,
a parameter related to the Colburn j-factor is pre-
sented as a function of flow power dissipation (the

factor, Nzr /c, was found to be nearly constant
within the limitations of the experiment, this is
essentially a plot of the heat-transfer coefficient,
h. A comparison is made in each case with linear
flow heat transfer through tubes of equivalent
length and diameter. From Fig. 3.2.11 it may be
seen that forced-vortex flow is superior to linear
flow only for power dissipations in excess of

17 hp/ft2. However, more extensive boiling-water
vortex-flow data’ indicate that increasing the ratio
of inlet area to tube cross-sectional area and de-
creasing the ratio of tube length to tube diameter
will result in an upward shift of the vortex flow
curve. The free-vortex results given in Fig. 3.2.12
indicate that, for the specific conditions of the test,
area ratio = 0.4 and L/D = 11,5, free vortex flow is
much superior to linear flow,

DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEM
G. H. Burger

The data acquisition system purchased from the
G. M. Giannini Company, which was briefly de-
scribed in the previous report, ! was installed and
placed into operation. For the initial check of the
system, three temperature recorders and one
pressure system, consisting of a 12-point pressure-
scanning system feeding a strain gage and a
Gilmore strain gage circuit, were fed into the in-
stallation. The data were recorded on the standard
log sheets for the 20-in.-carriage typewriter. In
addition, the data were logged on the punch tape in
Oracle code. The code was verified by the Oracle
tape readers. Since the initial check of the system,
a total of seven recorders giving 84 separate inputs
has been fed into the system, the system has been
operated to test all aspects of system operation,
that is, the typewriter, tape punch, tape reader,
tape code, logging format, and operational char-
acteristics, such as typewriter operational format,
carriage return, carriage return and reset, etc,,
have been checked. In addition, all data operational
functions of the system have been checked, in-
cluding the circuitry that provides for operations on
the data such as multiplication, division, and
addition,

Since the unit began operation, it has run a total
of 612 hr, There have been some operational
troubles with the system, mostly in the logging
unit, the typewriter, and typewriter linefinder,
Other minor troubles occurred that were a result
of incomplete checking at the factory and initial
design inadequacies. The faults attributable to
the vendor are now being corrected by the vendor,
and it is expected that the system will again be
in operation within a month. The system was
shipped from the fractory without a final system
check in order to meet the delivery schedule.

It is expected that with the completion of the
corrections and modifications now being made on
the system, it will operate in a satisfactory manner,

It is planned to operate the system with all the
maximum inputs possible (120) for a short period
to again check the system, After this period, it

is expected that the system will be used to record
and handle data from an actual operating test in
order to determine the capabilities or shortcomings
of the machine and to establish a list of criteria
for or characteristics desirable in future machines,

LIQUID-METAL-LEVEL TRANSDUCERS
G. H. Burger

Life tests of the three level probes operating in
NaK at 1200°F and above were continued. Two of
the units have now operated more than 9000 hr and
the other has operated more than 4600 hr.

Analyses of data obtained previously in wetting
tests of Inconel probes in NaK verified that, al-
though wetting is rather irregular and unpredictable,
at temperatures above 600°F it is complete within
a very short time (almost instantly). At tempera-
tures below 600°F, no definite time vs temperature
factor could be established.

The iron-plated [nconel probe tested as described
previously ! gave unsatisfactory results in that
there was poor wetting of the iron plate. Since
only one iron-plated probe was tested, this ob-
servation is not conclusive, but no further tests
on iron-plated probes are contemplated.

Wetting and calibration tests of four [nconel
probes in sodium have indicated that wetting in
the sodium will be similar, if not superior, to that
in NaK. Tests of these probes in sodium are con-
tinuing.

PRESSURE TRANSMITTER TESTS
C. M. Burton

Two Taylor Instrument Company pressure trans-
mitters designed for use at high temperatures in
the pressure range 0 to 200 psig are undergoing
overrange (300 psig) tests, as described pre-
viously,? in order to accelerate the effects of

the error limits. These tests are continuing,

THERMOCOQOUPLE TESTS
C. M. Burton

Life tests of a series of thermocouples were
terminated after about 11,000 hr of operation at
1500°F. Thirteen l/d-in.-OD, Inconel-sheathed,
magnesium-oxide-insulated, Chromel-Alumel, dual
thermocouples, and three similar platinum—
platinum-rhodium thermocouples were tested.

The end closures were Heliarc-welded caps. The
thermocouples were immersed in a fused-salt
mixture (NaF-ZrF ,-UF ,, 50-46-4 mole %). The
normal operating temperature was 1500°F, except
when calibrations were made at 1100 and 1300°F
against a platinum—platinum-rhodium standard
thermocouple.

On the whole, the thermocouples were performing
well when the test was stopped, although the
errors were increasing with age. Two Chromel-
Alumel thermocouples failed before the end of
the test. The test was stopped because all the
helium purge and vent lines had become plugged
with ZrF , vapor deposits.

After shtudown, it was found that a weld of a
spark-plug-level riser to the vessel had failed,
but the buildup of ZrF , was sufficient to prevent
significant helium leakage at the 2- to 3-psiqg
operating pressure, .

The Inconel sheaths submerged in the salt were
bright and in good condition, but the sheaths ex-
posed to the blanket gas were considerably cor-
roded. All the risers were plugged with ZrF ,, and
it would probably have been impossible to have
removed and replaced a thermocouple.

A similar life test in a sodium environment has
now run about 16,000 hr. Many of the thermocouples
show considerable error,

THERMOCOUPLE DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
J. F. Potts

Behavior of Thermocouples in the Temperature

Range 300 to 1100°C

Means are being sought for improving thermo-
electric measurements by obtaining a better under-
standing of the fundamental behavior of thermo-
couples in the range 300 to 1100°C. The major

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 1958

portion of the study is being conducted under a
subcontract at the University of Tennessee En-
gineering Experiment Station by D. L. McElroy,
The progress of the first year of this work was
covered by McElroy in a previous ORNL report.3

In the past year, a comparative evaluation of
thermocouples constructed of a number of com-
mercially available nickel-base alloys has been
made in order to establish relations describing
the effects of time and temperature on stability.
At a sacrifice of thermoelectric power and linearity
of the temperature-vs-emf curve, it was demon-
strated that alloys of nickel and chromium used
as positive legs demonstrated greatest stability
at 800 to 1100°C in air when the chromium content
was increased to about 20%. Chromel-P contains
roughly 9% chromium, With the same conditions
and objections as those given above, it was
demonstrated that nickel-silicon alloys containing
about 3% silicon evidenced greater stability than
the nickel-silicon-aluminum-manganese alloys,
such as Alumel. |t was further demonstrated that
thermocouple life and stability could be improved
by the use of carefully fabricated swaged sheaths.

Attempts to improve the performance of Chromel-
Alumel thermocouples have led to the conclusion
that isothermal heat treatment of Chromel-Alumel
thermocouples at 565 and 840°C causes shifts in
the original calibration with time at temperature,
Further, isothermal heat treatment at 900°C in
oxygen has indicated that for short exposures
Chromel-P dominates the thermocouple changes
and for long exposures Alumel dominates the
drift. Pickling of oxidized wire was found to be
a beneficial treatment; and partial immersion heat
treatments were found to be conducive to small
drifts of calibration in the temperature range 385
to 830°C. Further refinements of the techniques
for using the unilateral gradient furnace described
in the previous report? have led to its considerable
value as an analytical tool for quantitatively cor-
relating thermocouple performance with various
inhomogeneity-producing phenomena, such as
oxidation and recovery from cold work in tem-
perature gradients.

ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

Oxidation and Cold Work Studies?

Although much of what is known about base-metal
performance at temperatures up to 1100°C can be
extended in order to develop improved thermo-
couples for use at temperatures in excess of 1100°C,
major gaps exist in the fundamental information. A
survey of the present knowledge of thermoelectric
measurements has revealed that information is
needed on relations between oxidation and thermal
emf and between cold work and thermal emf. Tests
are under way over the range 300 to 1000°C on
variations of nickel-chromium alloys as the positive
thermal elements and nickel-silicon alloys as the
negative elements, including Hoskins Chromel-P
and Alumel and other alloys available from the
Hoskins Co., Driver-Harris Co., and Kanthal Corp.
For comparison, samples of thermocouple-grade
iron, constantan, and copper will also be studied.

Data have been obtained on oxidation (measured
by weight gain) in air at 700, 900, and 1000°C.
Tests are now in progress at 800°C. The data
indicate that greater oxidation of Chromel occurs
at 700 to 800°C than at 1000°C.

Tests of oxidation in a temperature gradient
(maximum temperature of 1000°C) of base-metal
samples in various sizes of quartz and Alundum
tubes were initiated recently. Microstructure
examinations have shown intergranular attack of all
the alloys tested above 850°C, whereas surface
attack predominates in alloys tested at tem-
peratures below 850°C. Depth of immersion tests
are also under way on Geminal-P and Geminal-N
(Driver-Harris), Kanthal-P and Kanthal-N (Kanthal
Corp.), Chromel-P plus columbium and Alumel
(Hoskins Co.) in quartz and Alundum tubes with
and without Inconel, stainless steel, and titanium
shavings or fines placed in the bottom of the
tubes. Preliminary tests indicate that the results
are greatly influenced by the choice of thermo-
couple well material. Drift tests in an atmosphere
of oxygen at a pressure of 30 psig indicate that
the thermocouple drift rates are not markedly dif-
ferent than those measured in air.

The cold work studies have progressed to the
point where the relations between rolling and
drawing reduction, respectively, and percentage
of cold work have been established for wire

samples that were initially round. For example,
wire flattened to 10% of its original diameter
receives only about 45% of the cold work it would
receive if it were die-drawn to 10% of its original
diameter, The reason for establishing this relation
is that it is experimentally more convenient to
flatten wire between rolls than to draw it through
dies, particularly when it is desired to impose
varying amounts of cold work on one continuous
sample. A series of experiments is being con-
ducted to establish the relation between tem-
perature, time, and percentage of cold work and
the ranges for recrystallization and recovery.
Hardness measurements will be made to establish
recrystallization temperatures, and electrical re-
sistance measurements will be made to establish
recovery temperatures. After these data are ob-
tained, the cold work vs thermal emf relations
will be established with the use of the unilateral
gradient furnace mentioned above. These cold
work studies will establish the practical limits
of precision of available base-metal thermocouple
alloys.

Calibration Studies?

Temperature-standardization techniques are being
developed through a series of closely controlled
intercomparisons of the results of melting and
freezing experiments with water, tin, lead, zinc,
antimony, aluminum, and silver. The temperature
measurements are being made with various platinum
resistance thermometers and platinum—platinum-10%
rhodium thermocouples certified by the National
Bureau of Standards.

Oracle Program for Thermocouple-Data Handling
J. W. Reynolds

Work on the improvement of the Oracle program for
thermocouple-data handling is nearing completion
at ORNL. The format for processing of raw thermo-
couple millivoltage data is being changed to include
the ‘‘standard’’ temperature only once on the final
picture, whereas previously the standard tem-
perature had been repeated for each thermocouple
test point. The coding of the thermocouple point
identification is to be changed to include the
location of the test facility and the type of test.

In addition to the columns for error, test millivolts,
and standard millivolts, a column is to be included

for the resistance or other desired parameter. For
aid in statistical analysis of a particular type of
thermocouple, the new format is to include the
summation of errors, the summation of squares of
the errors, the standard deviation, the average error
plus and minus three standard deviations, and the

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 1958

degrees of freedom. As an additional aid to the
reduction of the data to comprehensible form, a
program for presentation of the accumulated data

in analog form after it has been statistically treated
is being included.

BASIC PROBLEMS IN ELASTICITY
F. J. Stanek

Fundamental studies of conical, cylindrical, and
spherical shells were continued in which classical
small-deflection theory is being used to determine
elastic properties. The basic objective of each
study is to list the required stress and displace-
ment formulas and to provide tables of numerical
values of all required functions.

The conical-shell sfudy] is nearing completion
and a preliminary report? giving the results of the
work has been issued. The results provide a means
whereby complete analyses can be made for shells
subjected to a combination of axially symmetric
loads. These loads include edge forces and mo-
ments, membrane forces, and uniform pressure, as
shown in Fig. 3.4.1.

Equations are given for displacements in both the
meridional direction and nermal to the shell wall,
as well as for the stresses; The values of all the
necessary functions are tabulated for the dimension-
less coordinate x from 0 through 40, The dimension-
less variable is given by

and central difference approximations were used.
The terms 82q/8x2 and dn/dx were approximated to
a fourth-order correction factor in Ax by using a
Taylor series in each case. The term dn/0 was
approximated to at least a second-order correction
factor in At

The difference equations were then used in
writing a code for the Oracle. Through the use of
this code, a solution to the partial differential
equation can be obtained when D(x,t) = D(x). The
coefficients of the equation may be of any form
provided they are continuous functions. The ac-
curacies associated with the difference approxi-
mations employed allow the use of a relatively
large increment in t. This is very useful where
solutions are required for many values of that
variable,

3.5. ADVANCED POWER PLANT DESIGN

VORTEX REACTOR EXPERIMENTS
J. J. Keyes

Reactor Projects Division

The feasibility of the vortex propulsion reactor
concept which combines the principles of gaseous
fission heating and separation of the fissionable
material! depends strongly upon the nature and
strength of the vortex field which can be generated
at mass flow rates permitted by a binary diffusion
process. |t is shown in ref 1 that the desired
vortex field is one in which the velocity varies
inversely with radius — the so-called ideal *‘free-
vortex'' —~ as well as one in which the peripheral
Mach number is high. Allowable mass velocities
of the low-molecular-weight propellant are in the
neighborhood of 0.01 Ib/sec-ft. These require-
ments could be fulfilled, it was felt, provided the
flow remained laminar, although the influence of
viscosity was only approximated in the analysis.

An experimental study was therefore initiated in
an attempt to measure vortex strengths in a real
gas and to ascertain the effects of viscosity and
turbulence. The study to date has consisted
mainly of two phases: (1) measurements on solid-
wall tubes with all of the mass flow leaving at the
center of one end of the vortex tube, as assumed

in the analytical study; and (2) measurements with
a fraction of the total input flow bled off at some
radial position other than the tube center. In some
of the latter experiments, an attempt was made to
make the boundary layer laminar by bleeding
through a uniformly porous wall which formed the
outer boundary of the vortex tube.?

In both phases of the study, nitrogen was used
as the working fluid at room temperature. Mass
flow rates and pressures were chosen to bracket
estimated operating conditions in the actual
device by assuming similarity of the characteristic
Mach and Reynolds moduli and of the mass flow
parameter, m]/277,u, which appears in the approxi-
mate solution of the Navier-Stokes equations! and
in which m, is the mass flow per unit of tube
length in Ib/ftesec and p is the viscosity in the
same units as m,,

The apparatus for carrying out phase 1-A (Table
3.5.1) of the experiment is shown in Figs, 3.5.1

and 3.5.2. The geometry selected was a 1-ft
section of a 2-in.-|D vortex cavity bored into a
4-in. Lucite block. Twelve brass feed nozzles
were located in the wall of the block to form a
broken spiral of entrance jets spaced 1-in. apart
axially with a 90-deg rotation between adjacent
nozzles throughout the length of the block. The
inside surfaces of the nozzles were honed flush
with the inner surface of the tubular cavity. The
feed nozzles were supplied with gas from four
headers drilled into the plastic block so that

each header fed three nozzles in line. The arrange-
ment of feed headers and nozzles may be seen in
Fig. 3.5.2. Gas was exhausted at one end through
an adjustable annular orifice directly to the atmos-
phere. The geometrical configurations used for
the various experiments and the experimental con-
ditions are described in Table 3.5.1.

In phase 1-B, the vortex tube consisted of a
1-in.-ID, 12-in.-long plastic tube inserted into the
2-in.-ID tube for operation in the same test setup
as that used in phase 1-A. The tube was fed by
means of eleven symmetrically spaced, 0.020-in.
drilled holes in line with nozzles located at a
radius of 0.45 in. In order to measure the radial
static pressure distribution, a number of pressure
taps were located in the feed plate.

An over-al| flow and instrumentation diagram of
the test system is presented in Fig. 3.5.3. Helium
or nitrogen gas was supplied through pressure
requlators and appropriate metering devices to
each of the four supply headers at pressures up to
600 psig. Valves were used to control the indi-
vidual header flows. The pressure in the vortex
tube was regulated by the exit valve up to a maxi-
mum of 150 psig.

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 1958

The apparatus for carrying out the second phase
of the experiment (Fig. 3.5.4) was similar to that
employed in the first phase with one significant
addition: the wall of the vortex tube was made of
uniformly porous metal (sintered nickel) and it
was surrounded by a pressure jacket so that a
controllable fraction of the total throughput could
be bled off through the wall and metered. The

metal vortex tube and jacket are shown sche-
moticolly in-Fig. 3.5.5, in which the/ariaaemsnt
is similar to that of Fig. 3.5.1. The tube installed
in its jacket and in the test rig is shown in Fig.
3.5.6.

The objective of the experiments in phase 1-A
was to ascertain vortex strengths in the 2-in.-ID
tube under conditions wherein all mass flow was

The objective of the phase 2 experiments was to
investigate the effect of two methods of bleeding
off a fraction of the inlet flow at some radial
position away from the tube center. In the first
method, the bleed was from the tube periphery
through a uniformly porous wall, in the hope that
sufficient boundary layer stabilization could be
achieved to significantly lower the eddy losses
induced by shear forces at the wall and thus in-
crease the vortex strength. The Mach profile
obtained with a uniform wall bieed ratio of 2.8 is
compared in Fig. 3.5.13 with that obtained with no
bleed at the same inlet mass flow. Results are
presented in Fig. 3.5.14 for an alternate method
of bleed in which the excess flow is removed
radially at a position 7 = 0.25 so that the exit

flow at r” = 0 is held within allowable limits.
The main effect here is that of increasing the
inlet mass flow parameter m /27y over a large
fraction of the radius.

The foilowing general observations from the
data are noteworthy:

1. The vortex strength, M_/M ., for a 2-in.-diam-
eter increases from about 0.63 for plastic tube
No. 2 with m, = 0.0045 Ib/sec-ft (Fig. 3.5.8) to
about 0.08 for the metal tube with m, = 0.028
Ib/sec-ft (Fig. 3.5.13). Thus, the vortices which
were generated at low mass flows appear to be
significantly weaker than would be required in
vortex reactor applications. The plots of Fig.
3.5.9 for the 2-in. plastic tubes show that the
maximum value of M/M. which can be achieved at
low mass flows is severely limited. The small
peak in the profiles which occurs near the wall
for all the 2-in. tubes is not understood but may
be related to the nature of intfroduction of the
gaseous |et.

2. As indicated in Figs. 3.5.10 and 3.5.11,
the value of the exponent € in the relationship
v« r*€, where v is the tangential velocity, in-
creases from —0.4 at m, = 0.0045 Ib/sec ft to
about -0.8 at m, = 0.011 Ib/sec-ft; a further in-
crease in m, appears fo produce little change
in €, Since deviation of € from —1 is a measure
of the deviation from the ideal ‘‘free vortex,’’ it is

109
ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

concludgd that although the vortex strength is low
the velocity distributions roughly approximate free
vortex behavior at the higher mass flows.

3. The effect of decreasing the tube diameter
from 2 to 1 in., as illustrated in Fig, 3.5.12, is
to increase significantly the velocity at a given
radial position, 7”. [n the 1-in. tube a value of
M/M . of 1.25 was achieved (M = 2.45) at "= 0.085;
whilé at the corresponding absolute radius in the
2-in, tube at 7 = 0.043 in., M/M.= 0.6 (M =1.31).
At a radius of 0.25 in., the 1-in. tube produced
M/M. = 0.25, while for the 2-in. tube M/M.=0.27.

], 1.
Thus it appears that by decreasing the radius
the performance of a given vortex tube is not
impaired, and the advantage is gained of enabling
more tubes to be included in a given volume of
reactor,

4. When a uniform wall bleed is applied at a
given inlet mass flow, as illustrated in Fig.
3.5.13, the effect is to increase slightly the
velocity near the periphery of the tube at the
expense of that nearer the center. The rapid rise
at r* <0.06 for the profile with bleed is a conse-
quence of the small exit hole employed in this
run as contrasted with the larger annular opening
in the run with no wall bleed (see Table 3.5.1).
This effect is discussed in a forthcoming report.3
It is felt that the failure of wall bleeding to
achieve a significant improvement may be due
to the high degree of turbulence induced by the
jets in the vicinity of the wall so that a laminar
boundary layer cannot be achieved with practical
bleed ratios.

5. As an alternate method of bleed-off, a run
was made in which the excess mass flow was
removed at a radial position 0.25 in. from the
center of the 2-in. metal tube; no wall bleed was
employed. The results are depicted in Fig.
3.5.14, which indicates when compared with
Fig. 3.5.13, that for 7 > 0.1 the velocity profile
agrees well with that obtained when all the flow is
removed at the tube center. This technique shows
promise for increasing velocities and vortex
strength at the expense of lowering exit mass flow
rates.

In addition to the basic experiments discussed
here, numerous runs have been carried out to

the inlet nozzles, tube length, methods of bleed-
off, gas properties, and pressures. Some pre-
liminary separation experiments have also been
made using He-Br, and He-C Flé gas pairs, ds

conclusive, it is intended to continue the separa-
tion studies.

SURVEY OF DESIGN PROBLEMS OF AUXILIARY
POWER UNITS FOR SATELLITES

A. P. Fraas

Reactor Projects Division

The performance of various types of auxiliary
power unit that might be used in satellites has
been reviewed during the past several months.
Informgtion from the SNAP (Systems for Nuclear
Auxiliary Power) program indicates that the weight
of either solar cells or thermoelectric (or thermo-
ionic) power units employing radicactive isotopes
as a heat source for a reconnaissance satellite
will be about 500 to 1000 Ib/kw. While lighter
weights (350 Ib/kw) might be achieved with solar
cells continuously oriented toward the sun,
satellite missions which involve spending almost
half of the time in the earth’s shadow immediately
reduce the efficiency of such solar cells by
roughly 50%. Further, it is difficult to effect the
orientation of the solar cells toward the sun when
mission considerations entail orientation of other
elements of the satellite toward the earth. In
addition, the specific weight of either the solar
cells or the radioisotope power sources is not
reduced as the power output of the unit is in-
creased, and the voltage obtainable from such
units is low. From preliminary estimates it
appears that the use of a reactor as a heat source
might make possible auxiliary power units of
only 20 to 40 |b/kw for power outputs in the range
of 20 to 200 kw net electrical output.

Cycle Performance Considerations

One SNAP || power plant proposal suggests
three fluid circuits: a sodium circuit cools the
reactor, mercury serves as the thermodynamic
cycle working fiuid, and terphenyl is used to
transfer heat from the condenser to the radiator.
This approach entails three heat exchangers,
three pumps, three expansion tanks, and three
sets of instruments and controls. A very large
improwament in reliability and a substantial
saving in weight should be possible through the
use of a simpler system employing a single fluid.
In the mercury-vapor cycle used in both the
SNAP | (radioisotope source) and SNAP ||
(reactor) power plants, there will probably be a
substantial holdup of droplets of mercury on the
condenser surfaces, and therefore the weight of
the mercury in the condenser will probably be
greater than the dry weight of the condenser. It
would also be desirable to increase the operating
temperature level in the condenser to save con-
denser weight, and this is not practicable be-
cause it would imply too high a pressure level
for the high-temperature portion of the mercury-
vapor cycle. Further, the low specific volume
of the mercury vapor leads to so small a turbine
that the shaft speeds tend to be high, and the
aerodynamic efficiency of the turbine is low.
Cycles employing either aluminum chloride or
rubidium vapor should have several important
advantages relative to mercury for a light-weight
power plant, In both cases, a single fluid can
be used to cool the reactor and carry out the
thermodynamic cycle. Flow diagrams for power
plants employing these cycles are presented in
Figs. 3.5.15 and 3.5.16. The thermodynamic
properties of these fluids have been estimated
and reports are being prepared to present the

resulting data. Some preliminary calculations for
some typical cycles have been made and are in-
cluded below.

The rubidium vapor cycle would operate much
like a boiling-water reactor with a pump circu-
lating a weight flow through the reactor of
roughly ten times the weight of rubidium vapor-
ized per pass. Of course the vapor bubbles
formed in the reactor will pose serious reactivity
and control problems, but it seems likely that
the reactor can be designed to reduce these
effects to tolerable levels.

A gas-turbine cycle utilizing aluminum chloride
has some unusual characteristics. Aluminum
chloride dissociates from Al,Cl, to AICI, in the
temperature range between 700 and 1600°F, with
the bulk of the dissociation taking place in a
400°F range that increases with pressure. Pre-
liminary calculations indicate that the cycle
can be designed so that the gas will be mostly in
the form of Al ,Cl, during compression, while
during the expansion process it will be mostly
AICIl,. This, in effect, will cut the compression
work in half and thus produce a marked improve-
ment in cycle efficiency. The nature of this
effect can be visualized by examining the P-V
diagrams of Fig. 3.5.17, which compare similar
ideal gas turbine cycles for helium and aluminum
chloride. The work involved in each compression

or expansion process is directly proportional to
the area of the P-V diagram, and the net work is
proportional to the net area for the cycle. A
Rankine cycle utilizing rubidium vapor is also
included in Fig. 3.5.17 to show that the proposed
aluminum chloride cycle is roughly midway be-
tween a gas turbine (or Brayton) cycle and a
Rankine cycle in its requirements for work input
during the compression process.

The diagrams of Fig. 3.5.17 were prepared for
ideal cycles with no ailowances for losses. The
most important losses are associated with the
efficiencies of the compressor and the turbine,
which are likely to be of the order of 80%. This
means that with an 80% efficient compressor the
ideal work input will be 80% of the actual work
input, while the actual work output of the turbine
will be only 80% of the ideal. In addition, pres-
sure drops between the compressor and the

112

turbine will cause losses in net output from the
cycle. The nature of these effects can be seen
readily in Fig. 3.5.18.

If allowances are made for these losses to
obtain the actual net outputs for the cycles of
Fig. 3.5.17, the diagrams of Fig. 3.5.19 result,
The relatively large work input required for the
compression process of the Brayton cycle makes
it very sensitive to compressor inlet temperature,
because the compression work increases rapidly
with the initial temperature. As a result, the net
work output and over-all thermal efficiency of
the Brayton cycle drop off so rapidly with in-
creasing temperature at the compressor inlet that
for most plants the compressor inlet temperature
must be held below 200°F. At the same time, the
turbine inlet temperature must be at least 1200°F,
and preferably should be above 1400°F. For the

turbine inlet temperature, the net work from the
cycle is negative when the compressor inlet tem-
perature is raised to the level required to give a
reasonable radiator specific weight.

The aluminum chloride possesses another
important advantage over conventional gases for
use in a gas turbine; the heat transfer coeffi-
cient during the heating and cooling processes
should be exceptionally high. The large amounts
of energy involved in dissociation appear to give
effects analogous to those responsible for the
high heat transfer coefficients characteristic of

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 1958

boiling and condensing heat transfer conditions,
This should reduce the heat fransfer area re-
quired in comparison with the area required for
gases such as helium or nitrogen.

A further advantage of aluminum chloride is that
it could be used in the vapor phase throughout the
cycle so that there would be no free liquid surface
at any point in the system, and hence no expansion
tank would be required. While it is possible that
a free liquid surface could be stabilized by surface
tension forces or other factors, it is also true that
a great deal of difficulty has been experienced at
ORNL with stabilization of free liquid surfaces
in pumped systems, To date no one has yet sug-
gested a means of carrying out laboratory tests
which would approximate free-flight conditions.
Thus there is a major advantage to the use of a
working fluid which would avoid any difficulties
with liquid surface stabilization.

Summaries of the calculations on which Figs.
3.5.17 and 3.5.19 were based are presented in
Tables 3.5.2, 3.5.3, and 3.5.4.

Planned Program

The next phase of this work will entail a com-
prehensive series of analytical studies to de-
termine the performance obtainable from rubidium
and aluminum chloride as working fluids as com-
pared with more conventional fluids such as
mercury, sodium, helium, air, and water, The
studies will also disclose the major problem areas
most deserving of attention. If this phase of the
work indicates a substantial superiority for either
rubidium or aluminum chloride as a working fluid
in an auxiliary power plant unit it will be fol-
lowed by experimental determination of heat
transfer characteristics of the working fluid
chosen, investigation of corrosion problems
associated with the fluid, and more complete de-
sign studies,

EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF GAMMA RAYS
PRODUCED BY NEUTRON
INTERACTIONS IN AIR

F. L. Keller 0. S. Merrill!

The gamma-ray dose rate which results from
secondary gamma rays produced by neutron inter-
actions with the air can be neglected in most
shield design problems because it is small com-
pared with the dose rate which results from air-
scattered source gamma rays. Situations may
arise, however, in which it is desirable to allow
a large amount of neutron leakage from the reactor
shield and place part of the neutron shielding
material around individual regions which must be
further shielded. In many of these situations the
air-scattered gamma rays, which are usually of
rather low energy (that is, <l Mev), are attenuated
very rapidly by the shielding material around the
individual region, whereas the neutron-induced
gamma rays, which are isotropically emitted with
rather high energies (up to approximately 10.8 Mev),
penetrate the shielding material much more readily.
Therefore, as the thickness of the shield around
the individual region is increased, the relative
importance of the neutron-induced gamma rays is
increased and it is possible, in some instances,
for these gamma rays to be the major contributors
to the dose rate.

The two important methods of secondary gamma-
ray production in air are neutron capture in N4 and
inelastic neutron scattering with both nitrogen and
oxygen. In order to accurately calculate the dose-
rate contributions from these two processes, it is
necessary to know the cross sections involved and
the spectra of the gamma rays produced. The re-
sults of experimental measurements of the thermal-
neutron radiative capture cross section of N'4 and
the associated capture gamma-ray spectrum have
been reported by Bartholomew and Campion.? Very
little experimental information is available on
either the cross sections or the associated gamma-
ray spectra for inelastic neutron scattering with
nitrogen and oxygen, but Lustig, Goldstein, and

IOn assignment from Convair, San Diego, Calif.

35, 1347 (1957).

Kalos 34 have published theoretical values of the
inelastic neutron scattering cross sections of
nitrogen and oxygen from which it is possible to
estimate the spectrum of inelastic scattering gamma
rays produced from a given fast-neutron distribu-
tion, These cross-section calculations are, how-
ever, based on a mode| which assumes that a
statistical model of the nucleus may be applied to
the compound nucleus, and the results are question-
able for nuclei as light as those of oxygen and
nitrogen, Thus, it was considered important to
make a comparison between the shape of a meas-
ured inelastic scattering gamma-ray spectrum and
that of one calculated with the use of the theoreti-
cal cross sections for at least one situation.

An experiment was therefore performed at the
Tower Shielding Facility (TSF) that was designed
to separate out and measure as accurately as
possible the spectra of gamma rays produced in air
from neutron captures in N'4 and inelastic neutron
scattering.® This experiment, in which a 3- by
3-in. sodium iodide crystal spectrometer was used,
yielded two pulse-height distributions, one of which
was attributed to capture gamma rays and the other
to inelastic scattering gamma rays. These experi-
mental pulse-height distribution curves are shown
in Fig. 4.1.1. In order to eliminate background
counts from the measurements of neutron interac-
tions in the crystal, it was necessary to make the
gamma-ray measurements inside a thick shield
through which a water-filled collimator was inserted,
Therefore the gamma rays which were detected had
penetrated through the thick (4 ft) water colli-
mator, and the measured pulse-height distributions
had been considerably altered from the desired ones
by the water attenuation and buildup.

As may be seen, it would be an almost impossible
task to take the measured pulse-height distribu-
tions and attempt to work backwards to obtain the

spectra of gamma rays incident on the outside of
the collimator. Therefore, it was considered ad-
visable to make the comparison by first calculating
the spectra incident on the outside of the water
collimator from both capture and inelastic scat-
tering gamma rays, then determining the attenuation
and buildup associated with the passage of the
radiation through the water collimator, and, finally,
taking into account detector response functions to
obtain calculated pulse-height distributions which
could be compared directly with the experimental
results presented in Fig. 4.1.1.

Spectra of Gamma Rays Incident on the Outside
of the Collimator

A rather accurate estimate of the complete spec-
trum of gamma rays from neutron captures in N4
was obtained by making use of the direct experi-
mental measurements of Bartholomew and Campion,
The report by Lustig, Goldstein, and Kalos on
neutron cross sections of nitrogen3 supplied the
needed theoretical values of the total inelastic
scattering cross sections for neutrons with energies
up to 18 Mev and also the results of Hauser-
Feshbach calculations of the cross sections for
exciting the first four individual nuclear levels
with various energy neutrons up to 6 Mev, Since
these individual level cross sections are relatively
flat in the region of 6 Mev, they could be extrapo-
lated to somewhat higher neutron energies. Then,
for neutron energies above 6 Mev, the difference
between the total inelastic cross section and the
sum of the individual level cross sections repre-
sents the cross section for exciting some level
whose energy is greater than 6 Mev. Branching
ratios obtained from a review article by Ajzenberg
and Lauritsen® were used with the individual level
cross-section curves to obtain cross-section curves

2

for producing gamma rays with discrete energies
less than 6 Mev from these levels. The branching
ratios also indicated that most of the levels in the
region from 6 to 9 Mev decay directly to the ground
state, Since these levels are rather closely spaced
and since they decay predominantly to the ground
state, it was assumed in calculating the gamma-ray
spectrum that the difference cross section men-
tioned above could be treated as a cross section
for producing an inelastic scattering gamma ray

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 1958

with an energy approximately equal to the initial
energy of the neutron. In the case of oxygen the
first, and most important, level is at 6.09 Mev, and
it was assumed that the entire inelastic oxygen
cross section could be taken as the cross section
for producing a 6.09-Mev gamma ray.

With these cross sections and an assumed neu-
tron distribution it was then possible to estimate
the spectrum of the inelastic scattering gamma rays
produced. The spectrum of fast neutrons above 3
to 4 Mev (which are the only neutrons of importance
for inelastic scattering in air) was assumed to have
a fission shape in these calculations. The spec-
trum of inelastic scattering gamma rays obtained in
this manner is shown in Fig. 4.1.2, where the
discrete energy gamma rays have been represented

in histogram form with an energy width of 0.2 Mev.
The fact that the calculated distribution above

6 Mev is continuous rather than discrete, is, of
course, due to the lack of detailed knowledge con-
cerning the excitation of individual levels in this
region. Fortunately the number of gamma rays in
the continuous portion of the curve is small com-
pared with the number of gamma rays in the dis-
crete lines, and hence the approximations used in
the calculations concerning these gamma rays are
probably sufficiently accurate.

Spectrum After Attenuation and Buildup
in the Woter Collimator

Since all gamma rays which reached the detector
without making a collision in the water collimator
travelled through approximately the same water
thickness (™4 ft), the uncollided spectra at the
detector were determined by simply multiplying
the incident spectra by e ““(E)T gt each energy
point, where u(E) is the total linear absorption
coefficient of water at energy E and T is the water
thickness (~4 ft), Next, it was necessary to
determine the distribution of scattered, or buildup,
gamma rays at the detector for each case. Since,
as mentioned above, all the uncollided gamma rays
which reached the detector penetrated essentially
the same water thickness, it was assumed that
the distribution at the outside of the water coili-
mator could be artificially represented by a single
point isotropic source whose strength was nor-
malized to give the same uncollided flux at the
detector as that calculated above.

In the case of gamma rays it appears that even
for point isotropic sources in infinite media most
of the scattered gamma rays which reach a detector
are gamma rays which leave the source in almost
the right direction to reach the detector without
scattering. Goldstein and Wilkins? have calcu-
lated the spectra of buildup gamma rays at a de-
tector for cases of point isotropic sources in
infinite media, and, since the assumed artificial
point source was normalized so that the correct
number of gamma rays left the source in the direc-
tion toward the detector (although an incorrect
number left at large angles to the source-detector

axis), it was further assumed that the Goldstein-
Wilkins results could be applied directly to the
artificial point source to determine the buildup
spectrum at the detector in the actual problems.

Plots of the total unnormalized gamma-ray
number flux distributions at the detector (that is,
collided, or buildup, plus uncollided) for capture
and inelastic scattering gamma rays, which were
obtained in the manner described above, are shown
in Figs. 4.1.3 and 4.1.4, respectively. In these
figures the histograms representing the uncollided
discrete-energy gamma rays are superimposed on
continuous distributions which are almost entirely
due to scattered, or buildup, gamma rays.

Finally, it was necessary to include the detector
response so as to obtain pulse-height distribution
curves whose shapes could then be compared
directly with the shapes of the curves obtained from
the experimental results, Experimental measure-
ments of response functions of a 3- by 3-in. sodium
iodide crystal are available for various mono-
energetic gamma-ray sources, These response
functions were replotted in histogram form, where
the averaging was performed over 1-Mev intervals,
and interpolations were then made to obtain esti-
mates of the response functions at 0,2-Mev intervals
over the entire energy range of interest. These

response functions were then applied to the calcu-
lated number flux distributions at the detector to
give calculated pulse-height distributions from the
detector for both capture and inelastic scattering
gamma rays. A comparison of the shapes of the
experimental and calculated pulse-height distri-
butions from both capture and inelastic scattering
gamma rays is shown in Fig. 4.1.5,

The shapes of the measured and calculated
curves are in excellent agreement, Since the
spectrum of capture gamma rays which was taken to
be incident on the outside of the water collimator
was known to be good because most of it was ob-
tained from the results of direct experimental
measurements, the excellent agreement between the
shapes of the calculated and measured pulse-height
distributions from capture gamma rays indicated
that the methods used to determine the effects of
water buildup and detector response could be con-
sidered to be reliable. As a corollary, the ex-
cellent agreement which was also obtained between
the shapes of the calculated and measured pulse-
height distributions from inelastic scattering gamma
rays gives confidence in calculations based on a
spectrum of inelastic scattering gamma rays ob-
tained in the manner outlined, This analysis has
been published in more detail in a topical report.®

MONTE CARLO CALCULATION OF THE
DEPOSITION OF GAMMA-RAY HEATING IN
STRATIFIED LEAD AND WATER SLABS

L. A. Bowman® D. K. Trubey

It was reported 10 previously that an Oracle Monte
Carlo calculation of the penetration of monoener-
getic, monodirectional gamma rays in a lead and
water shield had been made that included a total
of 512 problems. The problems resulted from all
combinations of eight different lead and water con-
figurations (see Fig. 4.1.6), four total slab thick-
nesses (1, 2, 4, and 6 mfp), four energies for the
incident gamma rays (1, 3, 6, and 10 Mev), and
four angles of incidence (0, 60, 70.5, and 75,5 deg).
The results obtained included the dose rate and
energy flux throughout the slab and at the rear of the

The first bracketed factor represents the fraction
of incident energy expected to be deposited per
mean free path if the scattered gamma rays are
neglected. The second bracketed term is the build-
up factor. Near the boundary (x , small), where the
spectrum is largely determined by the first material,
the buildup is given by the first term. This term
damps out as x, gets large, and the buildup factor
is characteristic of the second material, The
buildup factors used in the formula were the results
of the weli-known NDA moments method calcula-
tion. 12 The energy absorption buildup factors used
were for a point isotropic source, since these were
the only buildup factors presented in ref 12,

The third bracketed factor is the ‘‘short-circuit-
ing’’ factor. An attempt was made to separate the
effects of the various parameters in the exponent.
The factors which depend on the angle reach a
peak at 60 deg. It seemed reasonable that a peak
might occur at about 60 deg when the combination
of a decreasing path length and a decreasing cross
section, as well as the final energy of a scattered
gamma ray as the angle of scattering increases,
were taken into account. The effect of distance
from the initial boundary also shows a peak (near
1 mfp). There is little short circuiting at short
distances, since the heating is due largely to first
collisions. The short circuiting damps out at
large distances since the buildup factor adequately
accounts for the scattered gamma rays far from

is usually taken to be that of the first material,
since, in general, the short-circuiting effect is due
to scattering near the initial boundary. This pro-
cedure seems adequate if the first material is 0.25
mean free path thick but probably is not adequate
if the thickness of the first material is less than
this. The variation with energy seems to break
down with low energy and as a result the formula
can be low by as much as 20% for the 1-Mev case.
It should be emphasized that the data obtained
with this empirical formula have only been com-
pared with data from the Monte Carlo calculation

of parameter values, and therefore it is possible
that the fit would not be so good for other values of
the parameters, particularly those outside the energy
range examined. The worst fits were obtained for
low energies, especially with lead following water,
but even in these cases the error was less than

20%. In nearly all the cases examined, the error
was less than 5%,

and more recent measurements are described in
Chap. 4.3 of this report. For a comparison with the
experimentally determined heating, a Monte Carlo
calculation of the primary gamma-ray heating for
slab geometry was performed on the Oracle, and
the results are presented here.

Three different shielding configurations were
considered. In the experimental arrangement, each
configuration consisted of slabs of shielding ma-
terial immersed completely in a 3/8-in.-l‘hick alumi-
num tank filled with insulating oil. The material
of each configuration was the same, with the ex-
ception of the gamma-ray shielding section. The
slab that made up the gamma-ray shield was a
different material in each configuration; in one it
was 3 in, of lead, in another it was 3 in. of iron,
and in the third it was 2 in. of Mallory 1000 (90 wt %
tungsten, 4 wt % copper, and 6 wt % nickel, den-
sity = 16.9 g/em3). In all configurations, two slabs
of lithium hydride were placed behind the gamma-
ray shield, one being 4 in. thick and the other
being 1 ft thick. Also, in all cases, a 4-in.-thick
slab of beryllium was placed in front of the gamma-
ray shielding material. The experimental arrange-
ment is shown in Fig. 4.1.11, and the details of
the metallic heating samples, containers, and
thermocouple locations are shown in Fig. 4.1.12,

The experimental conditions were approximated
in the calculational procedures by assuming that
all the materials had the thicknesses mentioned
above and that they were infinite in the other
dimensions, These assumptions were necessary
since only slabs of infinite extent can be considered
with the Oracle Monte Carlo code.!” The gamma-
ray energy and angular distribution of the BSF re-
actor used in this calculation were the same as
those reported previously,!®

Method of Calculation

The Oracle Monte Carlo code yields gamma-ray
heating in a region of specified thickness within a
shield as a function of initial energy and angle of
incidence of the gamma rays. Initial gamma-ray
energies, E, of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 Mev and in-
cident angles, 6, of 0, 30, 50, 65, and 80 deg were

considered in this calculation, with 9 being meas-
ured from the normal to the shield. Heating esti-
mates integrated over all energies and angles were
made in the shield only at the points where thermo-
couples were located, as shown in Fig. 4.1.11,
although the Oracle calculation yielded heating
and dose-rate information throughout the shield.
It was assumed that the thickness of the shield
preceding the region being considered was meas-
ured from the front of the slab to the front surface
of the air annulus. This resulted in a slight over-
estimate of the heating.

The Oracle results, given in terms of a function

In order to correct for the finite area of the source,
a Hurwitz correction was applied to the heating
equation, Since the BSF reactor is not a disk,
a radius @ was assumed which would give the same
disk area as the area of the north face of the
reactor. This correction, G(E), can be expressed
as the ratio of exponential integrals if it is assumed
that the correction for the total flux is the same as
that for the uncollided flux:

Equation 3 was numerically integrated from plots
similar to those of Figs. 4.1.14 through 4.1.16 for
each thermocouple location in the three different
shield configurations, Since the sample thick-
nesses varied, the integration was normalized to
heating per unit volume by dividing by the thickness
of the sample. These values are given in histogram

form in Figs. 4.1.17 through 4.1.19,

Conclusions

The results for heating in the beryllium of the
three configurations are in good agreement, differing
only by statistical variation. |t is interesting to
note that the heating is nearly the same in the
gamma-ray shield materials, since the attenuation
of the radiation in the shielding in front of the
sample and the absorption in the sample tend to be
compensating effects,

Most of the assumptions made in the calculation
cause the result to be too high. These are:

1. All the flux at the reactor surface is outwardly
directed.

2. The heating rate is that of a sample located
at the beginning of the void.

3. The source strength and angular distribution
are the same over the entire reactor face.
The last assumption probably gives the worst effect.
It might be possible to apply some correction fac-
tor to approximately take this into account, but
this has not been done because of the complexities
involved and the additional uncertainties which
would be introduced. A crude estimate of the
average source strength (based on the thermal-
neutron flux distribution near the center of the
reactor) indicates that the results are possibly a
factor of 1.5 too high. This estimate is corroborated
by the heating results based on an analysis of the
thermocouple measurements which were a factor of
2 lower than these calculated results,'?

A MONTE CARLO CODE FOR THE CALCULATION

OF DEEP PENETRATIONS OF GAMMA RAYS
S. K. Penny

A Monte Carlo code is being developed to calcu-
late at a point detector the angular and energy dis-
tributions of gamma rays emitted from a monoener-
getic, point isotropic or point monodirectional
source embedded in an infinite homogeneous iso-
tropic medium of constant density. The word
“‘monodirectional’’ is used here in a loose sense;
the emission directions are actually in a half-cone
specified by a polar angle, where the source-
detector axis is the polar axis, and they are uni-
formly distributed in the azimuthal angle. The
code is now in the ‘‘debugging’’ stage on the
IBM-704 electronic data processing machine. It is
hoped that by using special techniques it will be
useful for penetrations as deep as 20 mean free
paths, In its final form the code can be used for
neutron penetration also, provided a differential
cross section for scattering is given,

The purpose of this code is twofold, First, it is
hoped that it will shed some light on the discrep-
ancy between calculated and experimental energy
distributions from a Co%® source in water, the
chief difficulty being the magnitude of the distri-
butions. The calculated values were obtained by
the moments method,2%~22 and the experimental
results were obtained by Peelle, Maienschein, and
Love.?4 Second, there is merit in experimenting

with specid®¥onte Carlo techniques in order to see
when und where they can be applied.

The special techniques referred to above are
importance sampling on the first-collision distribu-
tion coupled with double systematic sampling,
statistical estimation, splitting and Russian
roulette, and a special form of output, Other
features in the code are an energy cutoff, a weight
cutoff, and a cutoff for distance from the detector.

Importance Sampling

The importance sampling is discussed here from
the viewpoint of a point isotropic source. The
technique for the monodirectional source is simpler
and straightforward.

In the code, an attempt is made to estimate

z= [dx fdy fdw ... fdt bx,yw,et) 2(x,y,w,0t)

and it is assumed that the probability distribution
function can be written as

b(xfylwl"‘lt) = f(xf)’) g(w,...,t) .
By definition

z(:x,y) = fdw... fdt (W, eee,t) 2(%,¥,00,00e,t)
22(:x,y) = fdw... fdt glw, vee,t) zz(x,y,w,...,t)

and f(x,y) is the probability distribution function for
the first collision, Further, x is the cosine of the
angle between the direction of emission and the
source-detector axis, and y is the number of mean
free paths to the first collision. If it is desired to
sample from f*(x,y) instead of from f(x,y) (impor-
tance sampling), then

— [(x,y)
dx Jdy f*(x,y) z(ix,y) ——— =% ;
fax fdy f*(x,y) z(:x,y) *y)

however, the variance is not usually the same when
importance sampling is employed as when the
normal sampling is used. The probability distri-
bution function for the first collision that gives the
minimum variance is of the form:

*(x,y) = f(e,y) V22ex, ) N,

where N is the normalizing constant. Kahn?® shows
this for importance sampling with one variable, and

25y, Kahn, Applications of Monte Carlo, AECU-3259
(1954) (rev ed. April 27, 1956).

134

his argument can easily be extended to two vari-
ables, The code will begin with the task of esti-

mating z2(:x,y)by performing an auxiliary Monte
Carlo calculation, |nstead of sampling from a
first-coliision distribution, x and y will be fixed

and z2(:x,y) will be estimated, This will be

done for a number of points {x,y). This will then
provide estimates for the functions f*(x,y), G(y:x),
and F(x), which will be placed in tabular form in
the machine. The functions G(y:x) and F(x) are
defined as

f_);o dn [*(x,n)

Glyx) =
S dn e

and

Flx) = f_: d«ff_: dn *(€m) .

Once the auxiliary Monte Carlo problem has been
completed and the importance distribution functions
have been calculated, the main Monte Carlo routine
is started.

Double Systematic Sampling

The importance distribution for the first collision
is sampled with the use of a double systematic

sampling technique, 2% as follows:
1+ ]/2
F(x1)= i=0,],2,o..N_]
i+ %
G()/l:xz) = ] = O, ]’ 2, see N - ] .

in these expressions, N = 2%= number of histories;
a is a positive integer 20. The point (x ,y )} is then
found by interpolation in the tables. The 's must
be randomized, since they should not be correlated
to i, This can be done by using the periodicity of
the pseudorandom numbers generated by the con-
gruence method. Each binary bit in a pseudorandom
number has a certain period, as illustrated below:

x x x 0 1 bit

eee X X X

26peyised by S. K. Penny and C, D, Zerby, ORNL.
If it is desired to obtain all the even integers, 0,
2, . (2%%1 = 2), logical computer operations are
used to obtain from a pseudorandom number the fol-
lowing number:

20 20~1 232271790
000...0 x x

period

we x x x 0 bit

Then, generating 2% random numbers in succession
will provide the 2% integers desired in random
order, and the random correspondence i €>7 can be
obtained. Of course, a separate random number
generator must be provided which has the same
basic random number but an initial random number
deep in the series. When a first-collision point is
chosen by the sampling technique, the initial
weight must be modified by the factor

flx oy V(2 0y) o

Statistical Estimation

The technique of statistical estimation will be
used at every collision; that is, the probability of
the radiation reaching the detector after the colli-
sion will be calculated and used to estimate the
flux at the detector,

Weighted Isotropic Scattering

It is planned to sample the direction after
collision from an isotropic distribution, rather
than the Klein-Nishina differential cross section,
and “‘weight’’ it with the Klein-Nishina distribu-
tion, This procedure was derived primarily for
simplicity and to save in calculational cost, [t
is certainly biased sampling, but for small sepa-
ration distances it is probably the best method of
sampling. For large separation distances the
variance of the estimated flux will increase, but
the increase may be compensated for intuitively
by the use of importance sampling and splitting.

Splitting and Russian Roulette

The techniques of splitting and Russian roulette
are to be used, with the splitting occurring at
the collision point rather than at a splitting
boundary. In other words, if the particle crosses
b boundaries with the boundaries successively
closer to the detector, it will be split into 28
particles at the final collision point. If a particle
crosses b boundaries with the boundaries suc-
cessively farther away from the detector, it then

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 1958

has a probability of 279 of surviving., Hf it sur-
vives, its weight is increased by 2%, The split-
ting boundaries are concentric spheres with the
detector as their center. Again the reason for this
technique of splitting at the collision point is
chiefly simplicity. In all cases the statistical
estimation is performed before either the splitting
or the Russian roulette techniques are used.
Although it may be argued that splitting at the
collision point will introduce biasing, it remains
to be shown whether the increased cost associ-
ated with an unbiased calculation would be
warranted.

Output

The output will be of a special form; there will
be no histograms. The usual process, which
provides histograms, consists of estimating the
flux at the detector and then determining the
angular and energy distributions from the total
flux arriving in a sector. The new code makes
use of the expansion:

flux. Single scattering is treated separately from
multiple scattering. The code allows &,/ < 15 for

single scattering and &,/ < 7 for multiple scatter-
ing. Of course, the coefficients for single scat-
tering and multiple scattering are completely
additive,

A choice may be made of any combination of the
following values in the output: number flux,
energy flux, energy deposition in the medium
(ergs/g), and energy deposition in carbon (ergs/g)
at the detector, carbon being the standard material
for dose-rate calculations or measurements, Also,
the variance of the estimated coefficients (4, ,)
will be automatically calculated.

Testing Procedure

The code will be tested against three standards.
First, results for no energy degradation and iso-
tropic scattering will be checked against the exact
solutions given by Case, deHoffman, and Placzek. 28
Second, results for a medium other than water will
be checked against the energy distributions of
energy flux fumished by the moments method,2%~23
Third, results for water as a medium will be checked
against the experimental work of Peelle, Maien-
schein, and Love?? and values obtained by the
moments method, 2923

A MONTE CARLO CALCULATION OF THE
NEUTRON PENETRATION OF FINITE

Monte Carlo calculations? of the neutron dose-
rate distribution beyond finite water slabs were
performed for various parameter combinations, In
the idealized probiem a plane monodirectional,
monoenergetic beam of neutrons was assumed to be
incident on a water slab of infinite area and finite
thickness. The angle between the incident neutron
direction and the normal to the slab was denoted

as 6, and the number of neutrons which penetrated
the siab was assumed to be recorded by a spherical

30The Monte Carlo machine program which was used

in this study is a revision of the neutron air-scattering

detector. The space around the detector was
divided into a number of solid angle intervals with
the apex at the detector point, and the number of
neutrons which entered into each of these solid
angle intervals was recorded. The energy spec-
trum of the radiation which entered each of the
solid angle intervals was determined by dividing
the energy range from some cutoff energy, E_
the source energy, E . into an arbitrary number of
equal intervals and recording each contribution in

to

its appropriate energy interval, This energy spec-
trum was then used to determine the tissue dose-
rate contribution from each energy and solid angle
interval,

The scattering probability was assumed to be
isotropic in the center-of-mass system. This is
essentially exact for the scattering by hydrogen
(the major scatterer) and is fairly satisfactory for
the scattering by oxygen over most of the energy
range of interest in these calculations. The density
of water was taken to be 1 g/cm3, All the results
were normalized to one incident neutron per second
per square centimeter of slab surface.

A parameter study was carried out in which plane
monodirectional beams of neutrons with energies,
Eqy of 0.55, 1.2, 2, 4, 6, and 8 Mev were incident
on the water slabs at angles, Oy of 0, 30, 60, and
75 deg. The thicknesses of the slabs ranged from
I to 8 mfp (mean free paths). The number of case
histories used for a particular problem varied from
5,000 to 10,000, depending upon the slab thickness
and the angle of incidence. The solid angle inter-
vals at the detector were defined by 90-deg
azimuthal angle intervals and 15-deg polar angle
intervals with respect to a polar axis which was
normal to the slab surface., A cutoff energy, E_
of 0.1 Mev was used. This value was chosen to
approximate the low-energy cutoff of most of the
present dosimeters. Fifteen equal energy intervals
were used to determine the spectrum,

Figures 4.1.20 through 4.1.23 show a set of
representative curves which were generated from
data obtained from this study. In these figures
dose-rate buildup factors, B , are plotted as a func-
tion of the finite slab thicknesses for various
energy neutrons incident at angles, 60 of 0, 30,

60, and 75 deg. The dose-rate buildup factor may

be defined as the ratio of the total dose rate at the
detector to the dose rate which would result if every
collision were equivaient to an absorption, It should
be noted that the results are plotted as a function of

For cases of normal incidence (65 = 0), a very
large fraction of the total scattered dose rate at
the detector is contributed by neutrons which have
undergone only one scattering event in the slab,
The fraction of the total scattered dose rate which
was contributed by singly scattered neutrons for
each of these cases is given in Table 4.1.1. From
this table it is seen that single scattering calcu-
lations may be expected to yield fairly accurate
results for dose rates from neutrons which are
normally incident on thick water slabs. The higher
orders of scattering become more important, how-
ever, as the angle of incidence, 90, is increased.

A detailed description of ail of the results of this
parameter study will be given in a separate report.3?

2 in. of hgral behind the stainless steel did not
affect the flux at 100 cm appreciably. The boral
did, however, cause a decrease in the thermal-
neutron fluxes at distances greater than 120 c¢m
from the source, possibly as a result of the re-
duction in the number of photoneutrons arising from
high-energy gamma rays. High-energy gamma rays
originate in the stainless steel following the capture
of thermal neutrons, and the boral reduces the
number of captures by absorbing most of the neu-
trons which are thermalized in oil and then re-
flected back into the stainless steel, 374

Thermal-neutron flux measurements beyond con-
figuration 41-A are also plotted in Fig. 4.2.4 for
comparison with the curve for configuration 4-A.

At 100 ¢m from the source the flux beyond con-
figuration 41-A was 16.5% higher than that beyond
configuration 4-A. The two configurations differed
only in that configuration 41-A was dry; that is, the

1 cm of oil between the aluminum window of the con-
taining tank and the first slab of stainless steel, as
well as the oil between the slabs, was removed.

As described previously,? several types of gamma-
ray shields were used in conjunction with 4 in. of
beryllium and 12 in. of lithium hydride. Measure-
ments beyond a configuration consisting of only
the beryllium and the lithium hydride (configuration
5-A) were made to assist in evaluating the data. In
order to complete the set of measurements, thermal-
neutron fluxes beyond this configuration are shown

in Fig. 4.2.5.

STUDY OF SECONDARY GAMMA-RAY
PRODUCTION IN LEAD

J. M. Miller

A comprehensive program for measurement of the
production of secondary gamma rays in lead was
initiated at the Lid Tank Shielding Facility (L. TSF)
for comparison with the calculation being made by
the Nuclear Development Corporation of America
(NDA). In the tests run thus far, thicknesses of
lead varying in l/z-in. steps from 1 to 6 in. and
additional thicknesses of 7]/2 and 9 in. have been

utilized. In each case the lead was kept dry by
placing it in a steel tank (5/ in.~thick walls)
posmoned against the source plate. An aluminum
tank (Y-in.-thick walls) filled either with oil or with
borc:fec‘3 water was always placed immediately behind
the lead. The steel tank which holds the entire con-
figuration has a ¥-in.-thick aluminum window on

the source side, and the recession in the tank wall
between the window and the first slab of lead in-
troduces a l-cm-thick air gap at this poeint in each
configuration. Gamma-ray tissve dose-rate measure-
ments were made in the oil or borated water, and in
some cases fast-neutron tissue-dose-rate and
thermal-neutron flux measurements were made in

the oil.

The gamma-ray dose-rate measurements in oil and
borated water beyond the various thicknesses of
lead are plotted as a function of the distance from
the source plate in Fig. 4.2.6. The measurements
in borated water were made primarily to determine
the effect of suppressing the thermal-neutron flux
beyond the lead. The gamma-ray dose rates in the
borated water were a factor of 3 lower than the dose
rates in oil in the region close to the lead and a
factor of 13 lower approximately 120 cm beyond the
lead.

Cross plots of the data from Fig. 4.2.6 are shown
in Figs. 4.2.7 and 4.2.8. The plots in Fig. 4.2.7
present the gamma-ray dose rates at points 100 cm
beyond the configurations, corrected for the inverse
72 attenuation, and show that most of the primary
gamma rays are attenuated by the first 3 in. of lead.
The gamma rays observed beyond greater thick-
nesses of lead are practically all secondary gamma
rays. The plots in Fig. 4.2.8 present the gamma-
ray dose rates beyond the various configurations at
distances of 80 and 100 cm from the source. This
figure shows that a lead thickness of 3 in. gives
the maximum effectiveness in reducing the gamma-
ray dose rate at a fixed distance from the source
and that increasing the thickness beyond 3 in. does
not result in a further reduction.

The thermal- and fast-neutron measurements in oil
beyond the various configurations are plotted as
functions of the distance from the source in Figs.
4.2.9 and 4.2.10, respectively. This study will be
continued with configurations in which beryllium and
lithium hydride will be used in combination with
the lead.,

commercial-grade boron carbide and aluminum

sandwiched between aluminum sheets. The sand-
wich is usually rolled to a thickness of 7 or 1/8 in.

Since the mixture is nonuniform, considerable space
exists between the chunks of boron carbide attenuat-
ing material, and, consequently, radiation can pene-
trate the shield by passing unattenuated between
the chunks. Because of this “‘channeling effect,”’
which is a statistical effect caused by the increased
transmission along paths which pass through less
than the average material thickness, the masses of
boral and similar heterogeneous shields must be
from a few per cent to several hundred per cent
greater than the masses of homogeneous shields
which would give the same amount of attenuation.

R. R. Coveyou’ has suggested a mode! with which
to calculate the approximate transmission of radi-
ation through materials that consist of randomly dis-
tributed chunks. The material is considered to be
divided into layers which have a thickness charac-
teristic of the size of the chunks. The holes in the
layers are assumed to be located in a manner
statistically independent of holes in adjacent layers,
so that the over-all transmission is the product of
the transmissions of all the layers, As the chunks
are made more attenuative, the radiation passing
through the holes between the chunks becomes
more important,

A method which is based on the Coveyou model
and which has been extended to include a distri-
bution of various chunk sizes and shapes has been
developed for calculating the fransmission of radi-
ation through heterogeneous shields. The method
has been used to compute the transmission of neu-
trons through boral. For the calculation it was
assumed that the boral sandwich was rolled to a
thickness of ]/8 in. and that the thickness of the
B,C-Al mixture was 0.085 in. with 40 vol % boron
carbide. This resulted in an over-all volume
fraction of approximately 25% for the absorbing
chunks, which were assumed to be spherical in
shape. The chunks were first considered to be of
11 different sizes between 20 and 100 mesh; how-
ever, it was found that assuming only four sizes
gave approximately the same results, and only four
groups were used thereafter,

The transmission calculated by this method for
normally incident 2200-meter/sec (0.0253-ev) neu-
trons through ]/s—in.-'rhick boral was 0.076. This
is to be compared with a transmission of 0.0015

70 . . .

calculated for normally incident 2200-meter/sec
neutrons by the homogeneous approximation.
However, the homogeneous approximation is an
inappropriate first approximation for this type of
shield.

The transmission of nomally incident neutrons
through a ]/B-in.-thick boral shield as a function of
energy is shown in Fig. 4,2,12, along with the limit
as the chunks become opaque (low energies). The
average transmission over the neutron distribution
shown (Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at room
temperature) is 0.096 for a constant efficiency de-
tector and 0.084 for o 1/v detector.

The transmission of isotropically incident neutrons
through %-in.-thick boral as a function of energy is
shown in Fig. 4.2,13, For this case the average
transmissions are 0.024 for a constant efficiency
flux detector, 0.021 for a 1/v flux detector, 0.041
for a constant efficiency current detector, and 0.034
for a 1/v current detector.

The calculated results can be compared with the
results of two experiments which have been per-
formed at ORNL to determine the transmission
through '/B-in. thicknesses of boral as measured by
1/v detectors. In the first experiment® the radi-
ation consisted of thermal neutrons escaping from a
thermal column on top of the ORNL Graphite Reactor
with an angular distribution of the (1 + /3 cos 6)
type,? which is more forwardly peaked than an iso-
tropic flux. Consequently, the experimental values
should be between the computed values for normal
incidence and those for isotropic incidence. The
transmission obtained for a Brooks and Perkins
boral sample was 0.070, while the transmission for
a Carbide sample was 0.094.
periment '? the radiation was a collimated beam of
normally incident neutrons from a beam hole at the
ORNL Graphite Reactor. The transmissions ob-
tained for two different Alcoa samples were 0.065
and 0.070, respectively.

This method will be described in detail in a
separate report, 1

THE GE<«BSF STUDY OF HEATING IN SHIELDS
K. M. Henry

Most shielding research programs, as was pointed
out previously, ' are devoted to optimizing shields
with respect to radiation attenuvation and to minimiz-
ing the size and weight of the shield. This effort
tends to increase the power densities, energy
deposition rates, and temperatures of the shield.

If energy deposition rates could be determined, then
temperatures could be calculated and cooling
systems designed accordingly. Errors in the size
and location of the cooling channels which result
either in less than maximum power operation or in a
shield that is not optimized in weight or size thus
could be avoided.

Until the study of radiation heating in shields’
was initiated recently at the BSF in cooperation
with the General Electric Company, energy
deposition (heating) tests had been performed only
on a small scale with samples in geometries that
neglected scattering and interface conditions. For
example, the energy absorption in small samples of
lead, iren, and aluminum, with the calorimeter com-
pletely surrounded by water, were reported by
Binford.2 In the experiment now in progress an
attempt is being made to compare the energy
deposition rates found in calorimetric samples in
relatively large laminated shields with calculated
results. If the calculations can be verified ex-
perimentally, then shield designs can be optimized
with respect to heating as well as attenuation.

The Laboratory participation in the experiment
includes providing the facility for the tests and
personnel to perform the experiment and to tabulate
the raw data. In addition, the BSF is supplying
neufron foils and counting channels for gamma-ray
and fast-neutron dosimetry. The General Electric
Company is furnishing all the shield slabs, the
heating samples, and the containing tank with its
associated parts. They are also supplying the
U233 fission chamber and its electronic counter-
parts. In addition, GE personnel will be responsible

for all data analysis, point kemel calculations, data
correlation, and preparation of the final report. The
necessary reactor flux and power calibration data

for the BSR loading being used, as well as the
radiation attenuation in water at various distances
from the reactor, have been supplied to GE by ORNL.

The shield mockup being investigated consists
of slabs of beryllium and lithium hydride separated
by a gamma-ray shielding section which consists
of one of three materials: iron, lead, or Mallory
1000. Measurements of the radiation intensities
and temperatures at the slab interfaces in the Be-
Fe-LiH configuration were reported previously.’
Subsequently, the entire series of measurements for
all three of the configurations has been completed,
but the results, including those published pre-
viously, ! are of questionable value since it has
been discovered that all the heating samples leaked
and oil entered the air region surrounding the
sample. Consequently, further publication of
temperature measurements will be postponed until
the series of measurements is repeated with new
samples. A detailed description of the experiment
and the results of some measurements of radiation
intensities are given below.

The BSR loading being used in the experiment
consists of an array of 28 elements, including two
shim-safety rod elements and one regulating rod
element. The face adjacent to the shield is 15 in.
wide (five elements wide), and 24 in. high; the
thickness of the core is either 15 or 18 in., depend-
ing on whether the row of elements contains five
or six elements. More detailed information on the
structure was presented in a previous reporT,3
along with the power and flux distributions, Data
on the attenuation of the flux and dose rates from
the face of the core through various thicknesses of
water were also published in previous reports. 43

A plan view of the reactor, the shield, and the con-

falnmg tank was presented in the previous repor'r
and is repeated in this report as Fig. 4,1.11 in
Chap. 4.1. The shielding slabs are submerged in

oil in a containing tank which is positioned 4.75 in.

from the reactor face. (In Fig. 4.1.11 the tank is
shown to be only 3.5 in. from the reactor. It had
been hoped that it could be positioned this close
to the reactor, but for the tests reported here, as
well as those reported previously, it was not
possible. The recent installation of a new reactor
support will allow the closer positioning for future
runs.)

The containing tank, which was designed to
withstand a 5-ft differential water-cil head, was
fabricated from ¥-in.-thick aluminum plates rein-
forced with 0.25 by 3 by 3 in. channels. It is 4.5
ft wide, 8.5 ft long, and 29 ft deep. After it was
positioned in the pool, it was filled with concrete
blocks to a height of 5.5 ft. An aluminum platform,
which rests on the concrete and is bolted to the
tank walls, provides locating pins with which a
removable aluminum tray holding the shielding con-
figuration can be positioned.

Each shielding configuration consists of a 4-in.-
thick slab of beryllium, followed by a gamma-ray
shield and 16 in. of aluminum-encased lithium
hydride. The lithium hydride section consists of
two slcbs of 4 and 12 in., respectively, separated
by a /8 -in.-thick aluminum spacer which is fitted
to the smaller slab in an attempt to reduce the
thickness of the ** in the assembled shield.
The larger lithium hydride section was supplied by
the LTSF and is used in this experiment only to
provide an effectively infinite lithium hydride
medium behind the smaller section. The gamma-ray
shield consists of either 3 in. of lead, 3 in. of iron,
or 2 in, of Mallory 1000. A slab of oil extends be-
yond the lithium hydride to the tank wall. In ad-
dition there is a %-in.-thick layer of oil between
the tank wall and the beryllium. (The desired
thickness of this oil layer was ¥% in., as indicated
in Fig. 4.1.11 in Chap. 4.1). All shields are as-
sembled on the pool room floor and installed in the
tank as a unit. This simplifies the positioning of
the slabs and provides an opportunity for measuring
the thickness of cracks between the slabs. The
cracks do not tend to change size with handling, as
indicated by measurements made before and after
the tests,

The beryllium slab and each of the gamma-ray
shielding slabs have stepped holes along the

horizontal shield axis in which plugs holding the
heating samples are inserted. These slabs alse
have l/z-in. deep grooves on one side that extend
from the horizontal holes upward to the tops of the
slabs. When matched, these grooves form instru-
ment wells for vertical flux and dose-rate traverses
at the interface of the beryllium and the gamma-ray
shield, The small lithium hydride slab has a
straight-through hole along its axis, and two instru-
ment wells, one near each side, extending from the
hole upward to the top of the slab. When vertical
traverses are not being made, the instrument wells
are filled with plugs of the same material as the
slab, the metallic plugs being bare half cylinders
and the lithium hydride plugs being full cylinders
encased in aluminum.

As has been described previously, ' the containers
that hold the beryllium, iren, and lead heating
samples are each 3 in. in diameter and 2 in. long
with an intemal void 2 in. in diameter and 1 in.
thick. The design of the sample cases, which were
fabricated from the same materials as the samples
they hold, is shown in Fig. 4.1.12 of Chap. 4.1. The
samples themselves are 1Y in. in diameter and of
various thicknesses (the lead is 0.1 in. thick, the
iron 0.2 in. thick, and the beryllium 0.4 in. thick);
they are suspended by three small insulating support
tubes in the center of the void in the container, The
case for the Mallory 1000 sample dlffers in thot it
is stepped (3 i |n. in diameter for 1Y% in., then 2/ in.
in diameter for / in.). The Mallory 1000 sample
thickness is 0.1 in. Because of fabrication diffi-
culties, the case for the lithium hydride sample was
made from 0.25-in.«thick aluminum with external
dimensions measuring 2.96 in. in diameter and 1Y,
in, in thickness, The lithium hydride sample is
1.25 in. in diameter and 0.5 in, thick. Calibrated
iron-constantan thermocouples are attached to the
center of each side of the samples and to each in-
side face of the cases. The leads are brought
through holes in the cases (sealed with Devcon B
plastic steel} out to the surface of the oil.

Neutron foil activation measurements were made
at the interfaces of the Be-Pb-LiH configuration.
Cobalt foils were positioned 12 in. apart along the
horizontal centerline and 8 in. apart along other
radii that extended from the center on 45-deg angles.
All the foils were placed in recesses in an aluminum
foil holder 4 ft by 4 ft by 0.09 in. thick. The results
for both bare and cadmium-covered foils are shown

in Figs. 4.3.1 and 4.3,2.

the photoneutron background produced by reactor

The total error introduced in the results, which are
plotted in Fig. 4.3.3, is probably £10%.
Fast-neutron measurements were made in the
vertical instrument wells with a *‘scaled-up”’ 7gmin.-
OD version of the Hurst-type phantom fast-neutron
dosimeter. The detector was attached to its pre-
amplifier in a manner similar to that of the thermal-
neutron detector. Binary-type integrating scalers
were used as the summing device. Some pulse-
height distributions were measured simultaneously.

F. Malone'

The experiments performed at the Tower Shield-
ing Facility in cooperation with Convair, Fort
Worth, 2 to obtain information complementary to
that obtained from the Nuclear Test Airplane (NTA)
program of experiments has been completed. During
the NTA experiments gamma-ray and fast-neutron
dose rates and thermal-neutron fluxes were meas-
ured both inside and outside the airframe contain-
ing the reactor while in flight and on the ground.
Measurements were also made on the ground in the
absence of the airplane structure. This last set of
measurements was duplicated in the TSF experi-
ments, and, in addition, measurements were made
as a function of altitude in the absence of the air-
plane structure. With these additional measure-
ments the influence of the air, the ground, and the
aircraft structure on the various measurements can
be determined. The TSF experiments also included
angular mappings of the radiation around the vari-
ous reactor shield configurations near the ground
and at various altitudes in order to obtain data
which will yield more accurate source terms than
were previously available. Some gamma-ray and
neutron energy spectra were also determined.

During the TSF experiments a large volume of
data was collected, most of which has not yet been
properly evaluated and correlated. For this reason,
and because power level corrections have not yet
been made, this report cannot be a complete ac-
count of the experiment. Rather it is intended only
to indicate the scope of the measurements and to
present samples of typical data, Detailed reports
will be published by Convair.

ASTR Shield Configurations

The Aircraft Shield Test Reactor (ASTR) consists
of an approximately cylindrical array of MTR-type
fuel elements mounted horizontally between two

grid plates; demineralized water is used as the
moderator, reflector, and coolant. The core and
moderator section is surrounded by a layer of lead
and tanks to contain the water shield, as shown in
Fig. 4.4.1. The lead thicknesses, 3 in. on the side
and 6 in. on the front, were not altered during the
experiment, but various configurations of plain and
borated water were used in the two 7-in.-thick side
tanks. The primary configurations are shown in
Fig. 4.4.2. For most of the measurements a ]/a-in.-
thick boral plate was mounted on the outside of
the reactor shield, but for two configurations,
which were otherwise identical with configura-
tions 3 and 5, the boral plate was removed. These
two configurations are referred to as 3NB and 5NB.
In another configuration, identified as configura-
tion 5.5, only the lower halves of the two side
tanks were filled with plain water to effectively
give a ‘277"’ shield.

The support from which the ASTR was suspended
allowed the reactor to be rotated 180 deg. For all
ASTR configurations a 6-in.-thick lead shadow
shield was suspended in front of the reactor and
was rotated with it.

Detectors

Most of the dose-rate and flux measurements
taken during this experiment were obtained with
three types of instruments: (1) a Hurst-type single-
barrel fast-neutron dosimeter; (2) an anthracene
scintillation dosimeter for gamma-ray dose-rate
measurements; and (3) a BF,; proportional counter,
in which the boron is enriched to 96% in the B'°
isotope, for thermal-neutron flux measurements.
Both bare and cadmium-covered BF , counters were
used at each location. When the detectors were
not positioned in or on a shielded crew-shield
mockup, they were suspended from a special sup-
port truss. In addition to these instruments, foil
detectors were used for special measurements.

be used to determine a source term. All these
measurements were made in the horizontal mid-
plane of the reactor at an altitude of 12,5 ft. Since
the ground would be expected to have considerable
effect on the measurements at this altitude, the
measurements were repeated and expanded in the
TSF experiments at an altitude of 186 ft (height of
horizontal axis of the reactor above the ground) and
were compared with similar measurements taken at
the TSF at an altitude of 12,5 ft,

A bottom view of the experimental arrangement
used for these radiation mappings is shown in
Fig. 4.4.3. The reactor was rotated around its

vertical axis, through an angle 8, measured clock-
wise from the reactor-detector vector to the re-
actor’s forward-drawn axis, and radiation measure-
ments were made with unshielded detectors at three
detector stations suspended from the support truss.
For these measurements the detector stations were
staggered to minimize direct-beam shielding of one
group of detectors by another.

Typical gamma-ray dose rates taken around the
ASTR at a constant reactor-to-detector separation
distance of 59 ft and an altitude of 186 ft with and
without a 14-in.-thick water side shield on the re-
actor are shown in Fig. 4.4.4 (ASTR configurations

taining the reactor axis, at distances of 0, 20, and
40 cm from the shield surface. The results plotted
in Fig. 4.4.7 are given as a function of the dis-
tance from the front end of the shield. For these
exposures the two ASTR side shield tanks were
filled with water {(configuration 3).

Direct-Beam Doses and Fluxes. — In addition to
the total dose-rate and flux measurements made
around the reactor, direct-beam neutron measure-
ments were made as a function of the angle 6. For
the fast-neutron measurements, the dosimeter was
placed in a cylindrical water collimator located
12.5 ft above the ground. In this position the
center of detection of the dosimeter was in the

same horizontal plane as the reactor axis and 33 ft
from the center of the reactor. The collimator hole
was 3'/4 in. in diameter and approximately 24 in.
long and was surrounded by an 18-in. minimum
thickness of water. Typical plots of the direct-
beam fast-neutron measurements taken while the
ASTR was rotated around its vertical axis are
shown in Fig. 4.4.8. These measurements were
token both with and without the water side shield
on the reactor (ASTR configurations 3 and 5).
Direct-beam thermal-neutron flux measurements
were made at a reactor-detector separation dis-
tance of 15 ft and an altitude of 186 ft. For these
measurements the BF3 counter was positioned in a
cylindrical, paraffin collimator which was lined

diameter and was surrounded by a 6-in. minimum
thickness of paraffin; the distance from the out-
side end of the collimator hole to the center of
detection was approximately 12 in. The collimator
was suspended from the support truss, and a re-
motely positioned cadmium shutter allowed both
bare and cadmium-covered measurements to be

made. Examples of these measurements are given

in Fig. 4.4.9 for ASTR configurations 3 and 5.

Scattered Doses. — Measurements of the scattered
fast-neutron and gamma-ray dose rates were also
made as a function of 8 for various ASTR shield
configurations at distances of 33, 59, and 100 ft,
although none are reported in this paper. For these
measurements, which were made both at an altitude
of 12.5 ft and at an altitude of 186 ft, the detectors

DISTANCE FROM FRONT END OF ASTR SHIELD (in.)

were suspended from the support truss in a line
which, when 6 = 0 deg, was coincident with the
reactor axis. The arrangement is shown in Fig.
4.4.10. The details of the direct-beam shields are
shown in Fig. 4.4.11, These shields were remotely
positioned to vary the direct-beam shield angle a
from 8 deg to approximately 30 deg and thus to
eliminate various solid angles of radiation while

Measurements in Crew Shield Mockups
In the NTA experiments the ASTR and its shadow

shield were located approximately midway between
the nose and the tail of the airplane. A cylindrical
crew shield mockup was located 33 ft in front of
the reactor in a position that was midway between
the reactor and the crew compartment in the nose
of the airplane. The total distance between the
reactor and the crew compartment was 65 ft,

In the TSF experiments, measurements were made
both in and around the crew compartment and the
crew shield mockup, both of which were suspended
from the support truss, as shown in Fig. 4.4.12;
however, the typical data presented in this paper
for this set of measurements were all obtained in
the crew shield mockup. The walls of the crew
shield mockup were fabricated from borated rubber;
the thickness at the rear was 21 in., and the side
and front thicknesses were varied from 0 to 11 in.
(see Fig. 4.4.13). The 30-in.-dia by 70-in.-long
cavity in the mockup was lined with 2.5 in. of lead
on the rear and with 0.093 in. of lead on the side
and front.

In addition to the measurements in the Convair
shields, measurements were also made in an ORNL

Effect of_Reiecior Side Shield Thickness. — The
oo

measurements of radiation in and around the
Convair crew shield mockup 33 ft from the ASTR
were taken as a function of the thickness of the
borated rubber side shield on the crew shield (de-
tector) for most of the ASTR shield configurations
at altitudes of 12.5 and 186 ft. Typical gamma-ray
dose rates, fast-neutron dose rates, and thermal-
neutron fluxes at the 186-ft altitude are shown in
Figs. 4.4.15, 4.4.16, and 4.4.17, respectively, for
configurations 3 and 5.

The measurements in the ORNL compartmental-
ized tank 65 ft from the ASTR as a function of the
water side shield thickness were made only at the
186-ft altitude. Three reactor shield=detector
shield combinations were used: (1) Plain water
shields both on the reactor (configuration 3) and
on the detector tank; (2} a plain water shield on
the reactor and a borated water shield on the de-
tector tank; and (3) borated water shields both on
the reactor (configuration 3B) and on the detector
tank. Typical measurements in this tank are also

plotted in Figs. 4,4,15 through 4.4,17.

Gamma-Ray and Neutron Spectral Measurements

In addition to the measurements discussed above,
which essentially repeated those taken in the NTA
experiments at Convair, the TSF experiments in-
cluded a series of measurements at an altitude of
186 ft to determine the gamma-ray and neutron
energy spectra at various locations. Gamma-ray
spectral data were obtained in the Convair crew
shield mockup for the 11-in.-thick side shield and
in the ORNL compartmentalized tank for several
thicknesses of borated water on the side. For
these measurements two sodium iodide crystals
were used with an RCL 256-channel pulse-height

PREDICTION OF RADIATION INTENSITIES AT
LARGE DISTANCES FROM THE TSR-ll

Y. R. Cain

The proposed construction of the Melton Hill Dam
on the Clinch River near the TSF area has made it
necessary to determine what the gamma-ray and
fast-neutron dose rates will be at large distances
from the Tower Shielding Reactor-1| (TSR-1}); there-
fore, calculations were performed to estimate the
dose rates for two operating conditions. For one
case the reactor was assumed to be ‘‘bare,’’ that
is, to have no external shield, It is to be noted,
however, that even the “‘bare’’ reactor will always
be surrounded by small thicknesses of water, alu-
minum, and lead (see Fig. 4.5.1 in Chap. 4.5 of
this report). This calculation was for an operating
power of 5 Mw, the maximum design power, at a
200-ft altitude, a condition which would result in
the highest dose rates that could be achieved with
the TSR-Il. For the other case the reactor was
assumed to be encased in a ‘‘beam’’ shield (see
Fig. 4.5.2 of section 4.5) which would allow a
highly collimated beam of radiation to be emitted

174

from the reactor. The results of this latter calcu-
lation, which was also for a 5-Mw operating power
at a 200-ft altitude, are expected to be more repre-
sentative of a typical operation. As part of this
investigation, a calculation was made of the un-
collided neutron flux 4200 ft from the TSR-| to
obtain a fast-neutron buildup factor for the case
in which an air-filled collimator extending through
the reactor shield is pointed at the detector.

Measured Dose Rates 4000 ft from TSR-I

Gamma-ray and fast-neutron dose rates at dis-
tances up to 4000 ft from the TSR-| have been
measured® for a reactor water shield thickness of
15 em. The data obtained, given in Figs. 4.4.26

Gamma-Ray Dose Rates for Bare TSR-Il. — The
gamma-ray data presented in Fig. 4,4.26 were used
to predict the gamma-ray dose rates from the bare
TSR-{l simply by accounting for the differences
between the thicknesses of the shielding materials
on the two reactors along a straight line from the
reactor to the detector. While the TSR-| had a
15-cm-thick water shield, the TSR-Il shield will
consist of 2.5 cm of water, 3.5 cm of aluminum,
and 5.1 cm of lead. The modified expression is

two reactors, accounting for the differences in the neutron fluxes on the surfaces of the two reactors, and
assuming that the fast-neutron dose rates 4200 ft from the reactors would be proportional to their total fast-

FastsNeutron and GammasRay Dose Rates for TSRall in a Beam Shield. — No experimental information
was available on which to base the calculation for the highly collimated beam; therefore, it became neces-
sary to perform an experiment with the TSR-1 in which a 15-in.-dia air-filled collimator was placed adja-
cent to the reactor in its 12-ft-dia water tank, Measurements of fast-neutron and gamma-ray dose rates and
thermal-neutron fluxes were made at a distance of 4200 ft as a function of the beam orientation angle, 6,
with the detectors positioned at § = 0 deg (6 deg west of due south). These measurements are plotted in
Fig. 4.4.29. The fast-neutron and gamma-ray measurements had a very high background, so the statistical
accuracy is poor. At the best point, 6 = 0 deg, the probable errors total 32% for the gamma-ray measure-
ments and 8% for the fast-neutron measurements. The statistical accuracy of the thermal-neutron data is
much better, however; the probable errors range from 7.4% at 6 = 130 deg to 2.4% at 0 = 0 deg. As a result,
the thermal-neutron data were used to obtain an assumed shape for the other measurements,

The measurements obtained for fast-neutron and gamma-ray dose rates at 0 = 0 deg were used to predict
dose rates from the TSR-ll with a similar collimator by accounting for the differences in the shielding ma-
terials on the two reactors along the beam axes. The shield thicknesses used for the TSR-1l were the same
as those given above for the bare reactor. The shield thicknesses on the TSR-l were reduced to 1.9 cm of
water and 3.0 cm of aluminum, The fast-neutron dose rate at 4200 ft from the TSR-Il operating at 5 Mw in a
beam shield thus becomes

where, for this case,

xpp=35¢em - 3.0ecm=0.5¢cm,
Xp) = 5.1 em,

and the values of X are the same as those given following Eq. 5. The resulting value of D (TSR-11, beam)
4200 ft from the reactor for a power of 5 Mw is 1,07 mrem+hr=1.

A similar procedure gave a value of 0.23 mrshr=! for the gamma-ray dose rate, Do (1sR-11, beam) The
total dose rate (neutrons and gamma rays) from the highly collimated beam shield was thus 1.3 mrem«hr—7,
82% of which was due to fast neutrons.

Figure 4.4.30 shows these predicted dose rates as a function of distance from the reactor. These dose
rates apply only for a point directly in line with the beam, and they can be reduced by about a factor of 6
by turning the beam 90 deg.

This value compares reasonably well with the value of 46 mrem:hr=! calculated above.

As a check on the validity of this type of calculation, a similar procedure was used to predict the fast-
neutron dose rates 4200 ft from the ASTR which could be compared with the measured dose rate reported
above for the same reactor shield configuration. The calculated result was 2.78 mrem+hr=! and differed
from the measured value by a factor of 3.56, the latter value being 0.78 mrem+hr=1, As a further check, a
calculation of the fast-neutron dose rate 4200 ft from the TSR-I in its 12-ft-dia tank gave a predicted value .
which was a factor of 1.8 higher than the measurement. These two calculations indicate that the value of
83 mremshr~! given above is probably a factor of 2 or 3 too high. The discrepancies probably arise partly -

because the number of neutrons which leave the collimator is greater than Eq. 9 predicts and partly because

the beam results for fast neutrons may not vary with angle in exactly the same manner as the results for
thermal neutrons (which were used to give the curve shape for these calculations). In any event, it appears
that the dose rate at 4200 ft which was calculated by this method should be conservative in the sense that

the calculated dose rate should be larger than the actual dose rate.

Calculation of Uncollided Fast-Neutron Flux 4200 ft from the TSR-|

A calculation of the uncollided neutron flux at a distance of 4200 ft from the TSR-| was performed to
obtain a fast-neutron buildup factor for the case in which a beam is pointed at the detector. For this
calculation the measured neutron spectrum, N(E), at the face of the Bulk Shielding Reactor® was used
for neutron energies up to 2.7 Mev and a normalized Watt's spectrum was used for higher energies, where

N(E) is given in units of neutrons.cm™%.sec™'.w™='.Mev~.steradian='.

If a cosine distribution on the
face of the reactor is assumed, the uncollided fast-neutron dose rate at a distance ! is:

4,5. TOWER SHIELDING REACTOR Il

C. E. Clifford

Design work on the Tower Shielding Reactor ||
(TSR-Il) is now essentially complete. The several
design changes which have been incorporated since
the previous report! and recent studies of operating
conditions and experimental facilities are described
below. The two shields which will be used initially
with the TSR-|| are also discussed.

MECHANICAL DESIGN?

The latest concept of the TSR-Il is shown in
Fig. 4.5.1. The design and much of the fabrication
of the major components inside the reactor tank have
been completed, although the fuel elements will be
modified following full-scale flow tests, The
present design differs from the one last reported
in several respects. The inside dioameter of the
upper portion of the reactor tank has been increased
from 36.75 to 39.75 in. to facilitate removal and in-
sertion of the fuel elements and the shielding above
the core. In addition, the ionization chambers have
been moved outward in the upper region of the inner
cylinder to provide more room for the control
mechanism positioning and actuating devices which
will be housed in a turret atop the central cylinder
region,

Another modification in the design has been the
elimination of one of the boral hemispherical shells
just outside the lead region. This will ensure
adequate clearances in the annular fuel region.

A 2-ft-thick shield of lead shot and water has been
added above the central fuel elements to reduce
the gamma-ray leakage through the central cylinder.
This will be especially important when the reactor
is enclosed in a shield mockup. This lead-and-
water shield, which can be seen in Fig. 4.5.1,

2The mechanical design work on the TSR-ll is being
done by the Engineering Department,

will be penetrated by approximately 120 helical
ducts through which the cooling water will flow.
The gamma-ray leakage through this shield will
never exceed the leakage through any shield used
with the TSR-ll. The shield shown above the core
in the region between the reactor tank and the inner
cylinder will be removable.

The design of the TSR-Il is such that it can be
encased in various shields. The first shield with
which the reactor will be used will be a spherical
shield having a beam hole both fore and aft (see
discussion of shield designs in subsequent section
of this chapter). The entire assembly will be sus-
pended from a platform, as shown in Fig. 4.5.2, and
it can be rotated around the vertical axis so that
the beam holes can sweep a horizontal plane. When
the reactor is suspended in this manner, the cooling
water will pass through a coaxial swivel joint be-
fore it enters and after it leaves the reactor tank.

The reactor and beam shield may also be sus-
pended so that the beam holes will sweep a vertical
plane, For this case, two 12-ft girder-like members
will be attached to the side of the shield through an
axle and bearings, and the cooling water will enter
through a swivel fitting and the hollow axle of one
support member and leave through a similar arrange-
ment on the other support member. By alternately
using the two beam holes, a beam can sweep the
whole 360 deg in the vertical plane without tilting
the reactor more than 90 deg from the vertical
position,

Calculations have indicated that, with a 30-deg
conical section removed from the shield, a 6775
ft-lb torque will be required to rotate the reactor
and shield so that the removed section will sweep a
vertical arc. A much smaller torque will be re-
quired to sweep the horizontal arc. A Char-Lynn
torque booster working through a worm and 180-
tooth gear will be used to rotate the reactor as-
sembly. A torque booster under full load has per-
formed satisfactorily in laboratory tests,

CONTROL SYSTEMS?

Control Mechanism

The experimental mockup of the control mechanism
for the TSR-II, which was described previously, '
was tested and found to have a short life owing to
excessive wear of the traveling nut of the position-
ing device, Several modifications of the design
failed to increase the life. Design changes were

186

then mode so that the pressure on the traveling nut
was reduced by nearly a factor of 10. This was
accomplished by reducing the size of the seal that
restricts the flow out of the chamber and increasing
the area on which pressure is applied to seal the
control plate assembly against the traveling nut.

3The controls system for the TSR-ll is being develop-
ed by the Reactor Controls Group.

The force on the traveling nut was reduced to 10 |b,
the difference between the spring force and the hy-
draulic force. Proper guidance and longer life were
ensured by using stellite bearings instead of minia-
ture roller bearings on the control plate assembly
and by using piston rings to provide a good seal
between the assembly and the cylinder wall. With
these changes, a model of the control mechanism
(see Fig. 4,5.3) was still operating successfully
when a test was terminated after 5000 cycles. The
model is shown in the test stand in Fig. 4.5.4. The
model will be tested later under flow conditions.

A total of five control mechanisms will be used to
operate neutron absorbing grids for shim-safety pur-
poses in the TSR-Il. A sixth grid, which does not
scram, will be used for fine control. The neutron-
absorbing umbrella-shaped grids will be made of
Inconel-clad cadmium ribbons. It had previously
been planned? to use perforated boron-loaded
plates as the neutron absorbers byt the fabrication
of the Inconel-clad cadmium was more feasible.

Electrohydraulic Transducer for Control
of Water Pressure in the
Control Mechanism

J. E. Marks?

An electrohydraulic transducer will be used to
actuate the control mechanism. The purpose of the
transducer is to allow electrical control of the water
pressure in the TSR-Il control mechanism with the
standard ORNL magnet circuitry. The transducer
is a bypass pressure regulator with electrical rather
than mechanical adjustment. As a force-balancing
device it compares the control mechanism water
pressure acting on a diaphram with the thrust of a
solenoid and applies the difference between the
two forces to a spring. Any differential force
causes the spring to deflect proportionately, and
the deflection is used to displace a valve plug away
from or toward its seat, depending upon whether
the water pressure effect is greater or less than the
thrust of the solenoid. This valve is in a shunt
relation to the control mechanism.

Between the source of water and the control
mechanism~transducer load, there is a restriction
of known magnitude. The load pressure is princi-
pally a sum of the source pressure less the pressure
drop across this restriction, and the pressure drop
is in turn proportional to the square of the total
flow through both devices. Hence the transducer
can affect the pressure seen by the control mech-
anism.

188

The electrical input to the solenoid is from the
circuitry of the standard magnet amplifier and sigma
bus. One design model of the transducer, shown in
Fig. 4.5.5, has been built and tested. With an in-
put of 100 to 0 ma, the control range was from the
operating pressure P to (P — 20) psig. This
range was sufficient to regulate the load pressure
between the scram condition and the stable operat-
ing condition of all the control mechanisms tried.
The load pressure followed a scram signal input
after a delay of 20 msec. This was adjudged as
satisfactory; however, a later design incorporating
several improvements is to be tested soon.

The advantages of the transducer over an “‘on-
off’" type of device, such as a solenoid valve, are
the same as those of magnet amplifiers in com-
parison with relays in conventional safety magnet
confrol circuits. Furthermore, the fransducer will
supply a regulated source of water at any required
pressure to improve stability and reliability of the
control mechanism operation.

TSR-Il Block Diagram
L. C. Oakes®

The logic of the TSR-II block diagram (shown in
Fig. 4.5.6) falls into the general pattern of that of
other ORNL reactors and therefore it is not dis-
cussed in detail here. However, many small dif-
ferences brought about by special features of the
TSR-1I have altered the specific modes of operation,
and these differences are described below.

Grid Motion. ~ Since the TSR-I| will have one
drive unit common to all five of the shim-safety
grids, it will not be possible to move one grid in-
dependently of the others. Thus any operation of
the drive is analogous to ‘‘group operation” in the
conventional reactor. For orderly operation, a means
for producing more modest changes in reactivity
must be available to the operator. For this
operation, a slow insertion and slow withdrawal
mode is provided wherein the drive runs at approxi-
mately 20% of full speed. All grid withdrawal is
stopped by 10-sec periods, and the grid drive
switching is so arranged that a 25-sec period will
stop fast withdrawal and automatically limit shim
motion to the slow-speed mode.

Avutomatic Shim Insertion. ~ Although automatic
shim insertion has been used previously, the
scheme presented here is aslight departure from
the normal concept. As shown in the block diagram,
when the servo is on and the regulating grid reaches

the lower limit, the shims will be inserted at the
slower speed until the regulating grid withdraws to
the intermediate limit switch. This action takes
place only if the period is more positive than

-100 sec.

There are two normal conditions which will
cause the regulating grid to drive to the lower limit
during operation. One will occur when, for some
reason, such as the reduction of the water inlet
temperature, the reactivity is increasing and the
regulating grid drives to the lower limit while
holding a constant power level. Under this con-
dition, since the reactor period is infinite, the
shims would be expected to drive in to re-establish
the regulating grid in the center of its stroke. The
other condition will occur when a demand for re-
duced power causes the regulating grid to drive to
the lower {imit. In the latter case, however, the
period is likely to be shorter than ~100 sec, and
automatic shim insertion will be inhibited. In this
condition a substantial shim insertion would drive
the reactor far subcritical, and upon reaching the
desired lower power level the regulating grid would
be driven to the upper limit with the reactor still
subcritical. The 100-sec period interlock eliminates
the need for reshiming after a reduction in power
level.

Fission Chamber Drive. —~ An automatic mode of
operation is provided for the fission chamber which,
at request, will hold the counting rate between 2
counts/sec and 10° counts/sec. This mode of
operation relieves the operator of the task of keep-
ing the counting channel on scale and contributes
to an orderly operating system. |n addition, since
the pulse preamplifier is contained in the same can
as that used to contain the fission chamber and sees
the same flux, the automatic mode of operation en-
sures that the electronic components will not be
unduly irradiated. When the automatic mode of
operation has not been requested, an annunciator
warns the operator when the counting rate has ex-
ceeded 10° counts/sec.

Test and Automatic Rundown Inhibit (TARDI). -
TARDI permits periodic testing of shim drive
mechanism performance without the encumberance
of certain operating interlocks. |t may be used only
so long as all seat switches indicate that the grids
are seated, the shim pump pressure is zero, and the
key switch is off.

Door Interlocks. = At the request of the operator,
the front door interlock may be temporarily blocked
to permit personnel to enter and leave the control
house at shift change without shutting down the
reactor. Permission to bypass the front door in-
terlock constitutes a mode of operation and is

described as follows: When the log N indicates
that the power level is below 500 w the operator
may request that the front door interlock be by-
passed. While the bypass is in effect the following
conditions prevail:

1. Personnel may enter and leave the front door
without producing a scram.

2. No shim grid withdrawal is permissible.

3. The servo will remain in operation to counter-
act reactivity changes resulting from such things as
reduction in the temperature of the cooling water.

4. Any rise in power above 500 w will produce a
reverse.

At the request of the operator, normal operating
conditions may be restored. Before permission is
granted to withdraw shims, however, the horn which
is always sounded prior to reactor operation at the
TSF must again be sounded for 3 min to warn per-
sonnel who may have been left outside the building.

Water System Interlocks. — There are two modes
of operation of the reactor from the standpoint of
the water system: the power mode and the test
mode. With the power mode the reactor is operated
at or near full power, and the flow is varied between
200 and 1000 gpm over the power range. With the
test mode the reactor is operated at a power level
sufficiently low to prevent overheating with no
water flow. This is brought about by a test switch
designated throughout the block diagram as ‘‘water
test.”’ Prior to a startup for a power run the main
pump must be operated at the full flow of 1000 gpm
for 3 min in order to produce sufficient mixing of
the water to remove any severe temperature gradients
from the system. This pump delay may run con-
currently with the startup delay. Failure of the
main pump will produce a scram rather than a re-
verse, The more drastic measure is preferred in
order to lessen the afterheat probiem,

The small volume of water in the reactor vessel
and the exposure of the vessel and interconnecting
hoses to the cold weather bring about special re-
quirements with respect to afterheat and winter
freezes. A highly reliable turbine pump which will
deliver between 10 and 40 gpm to the reactor through
the main pump lines will be operated 24 hr a day.
Since this emergency pump must remove the after-
heat in the event of main pump failure, it will be
operated from an a-¢ to d-¢ converter and a bank of
60 station batteries capable of running the pump at
full delivery for 8 hr or more. If a failure of the
emergency pump should occur, the reactor will be

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 1958

reversed to shutdown level. An electric heater in
the emergency pump line will maintain a safe temper-
ature when the system is unattended in the winter.

Reactor Controls Cubicle

The reactor controls cubicle has been delivered
and set up at the Tower Shielding Facility. The
cubicle, which is 14 ft long, 7 ft 5 in. high, and
7 ft deep, is shown in Fig. 4.5.7. It is designed
for unattended operation and is patterned after the
cubicles for the Bulk Shielding Reactor and the Pool
Critical Facility. The cubicle will be partially wired
and then moved into its final position when the con-
trol console and vertical board for the Tower
Shielding Reactor | are removed.

HEAT REMOVAL EQUIPMENT

The portion of the 5-Mw heat removal system which
is being constructed by an outside contractor should
be completed in October., The only holdup at present
is the delivery of one pump to the contractor. The
system will be subjected to a hydrostatic test with
the 6-in. lines to the tower legs capped off. A flow
test of the system will be made by short circuiting
the 6-in. pipes to the tower legs with a 6-in. hose.

In order to provide for the event that the studies
by Gambill and Hoffman (see below) indicate that
a Reynolds number of 7000 is necessary, an in-
vestigation is being made of the cost of raising the
cooling water flow rate or raising the system static
pressure or both to achieve the desired Reynolds
number for turbulent flow.

NUCLEAR CALCULATIONS

Nuclear calculations which were performed for the
TSR-1l with the 3G3R Oracle code were reported
previously. '+6=7 A multigroup, multiregion reactor

of this code to a Goertzel-Selengut type has been
used to perform a number of further calculations for

the TSR-|l, as discussed below.

Comparison of Calculations and
Critical Experiments

In order to confirm the validity of this calcu-
lational method and also to determine the effect of
a lead-boral layer outside the fuel region, calcu-
lations were first performed for three critical ex-
periments which were set up in finite slab geometry
as shown in Fig. 4.5.8 (the figure shows only one-
half of each configuration). Each fuel region con-
sisted of a 4 by 6 array of standard BSR fuel ele-
ments, and boral sheets simulated the control
plates. Clean, or nearly clean, experiments® were
obtained for configurations A and B by heating the
water in the assembly tank and simultaneously

withdrawing a cadmium rod to maintain the assembly
critical. On configuration B, a portion of the rod
(2.75¢ worth) was still inserted when the rod travel
was used up.

Configuration C was set up to evaluate the effect
on the reactivity of removing the lead and boral
layers. Because estimates of excess reactivity at
room temperature for both configurations B and C
were available from rod calibrations, configuration
C was not heated to attain the ‘‘clean’’ state.

A comparison between the results of experiments
and the calculations is presented in Table 4.5.1.
The error for the three cases averages about 1%.
The experimental & is the multiplication constant
that would have been observed with the rod com-
pletely withdrawn, i.e., in the “‘clean’’ condition.

Reactivity Coefficients

Void coefficients for the core were computed from
the change in the multiplication constant produced
by deleting the water (but not the aluminum or
uranium) from thin spherical annuli in the core. The
results are shown as the points in Fig. 4.5.9. A
“teasonable’’ curve was drawn through the calcu-
lated points and volume-averaged to obtain a mean
void coefficient of ~2.15 x 1074 Ak/k (in per cent)

per cubic centimeter of void, This is to be com-
pared with a value of =3.5 x 10=# which was reported
for SPERT |.19

Temperature coefficients were calculated both for
density and for thermal base changes. The net
temperature coefficient was =0,77 x 102 Ak/k
(in per cent) per °C, which can be compared with a

valve of -0.9 x 10~ 2 for SPERT 1.0

For various reasons (for example, cumulative
tolerances in fabrication), core boundaries may de-
viate from the desired locations, An estimate of
the effect of such deviations on the reactivity was
made by deleting uranium from a thin spherical
annulus at the outer edge of the core while the
total amount of uranium was kept constant. The
radial coefficient was found to be 0.23 Ak/k (in per
cent) per centimeter,

These reactivity coefficients are summarized in
Table 4.5.2, in which a mass coefficient is also
given.

Control *‘Shell’’ Effectiveness

The control grid effectiveness was recalculated
as a function of the separation distance from the
fuel, with the contral grids being treated simply as
thin regions or shells. The results are shown in
Fig. 4.5.10. The shape of the curve is in good
agreement with the results of the earlier 3G3R
Oracle calculations, ! although it is a factor of
5.2 higher. The apparent discrepancy is due
primarily to the difference in absorption cross
sections used for the shells. The experimental
data shown in the figure are from the Bulk Shielding
Reactor test with eight solid stainless steel plates,
which was described previously.!! The BSR data
are normalized to the calculated values at the first
experimental point.

CONTROL GRID EFFECTIVENESS

The nuclear model used for the calculations de-
scribed above is a complete shell which is assumed
to move uniformly away from the fuel region, and
therefore it does not duplicate the control grids
which will be used in the TSR-ll. The actual con-
trol and safety grids will cover less than one-half
of the core-reflector interface, and, because of the
fixed radius of the plates, the edges of the plates

will move away from the core at a slower rate than
will the center of the plate.

In order to determine the worth of an actual grid,
the grid area was divided into rings with their
common center at the center of the grid, and the
worth of each ring was determined as a function of
its normal distance from the core. The total worth
of the grid was then defermined by summing the
worth of all areas of each grid for a given separation
distance between the core and the center of the
plate. The results are presented in Fig. 4.5.11.
The Inconel-clad cadmium ribbons in the regulating
grid and in the lower shim-safety grid will be
spaced ]’46 in. apart to permit water to flow through
the internal reflector region; therefore, these plates
are worth only one-half as much in reactivity as the
remaining shim-safety grids.

After the control grid worth was determined, the
thermal-neufron flux distribution throughout the
reactor (see Fig. 4.5.12) and the source distribution
in the core (see Fig. 4.5.13) were determined from
the multigroup calculations with the control grid po-
sitioned for operation at 5 Mw.

SELECTION OF CRITICAL MASS FOR TSR-ll

Nuclear calculations were performed previously
with the 3G3R code to aid in establishing the
critical mass of the TSR-Il. When the effects of
the control shells, the external shield, xenon build-
up, fuel burnup, and possible errors in fuel loading
were considered, the calculated critical mass for
the reactor was 8.2 kg of U235 (see ref 1). Since
the calculations and critical experiments reported
above have indicated that the TSR-Il lead-boral
shield does not measurably change the critical
mass, additional critical mass calculations were
performed with the multigroup, multiregion code for
a clean, cold, water-reflected, spherical annulus
with the TSR-|| core dimensions and volume
fractions. Sufficient U?3° was then added to in-
crease the reactivity by 6.8 Ak/k (in per cent).

The results gave a loading of 8.1 kg of U?3% for the

Fuel. TSR-Il core, and this was set as the critical mass.

RADIUS IN FUEL REGION (cm)

Fig. 4.5.13, Source Distribution in the TSR-Il Fuel
Region as a Function of Radius: Boral Shell 4 cm from

Of the 6.8% increase in the reactivity, 1.5% is to
cover the worth of the control grids in the fully
withdrawn position, 0.3% is allowed for structural
material in the core region, 1.4% is to cover the
worth of fixed neutron absorber plates in the in-
ternal reflector region, 2.0% is to allow for an error
in the calculations, and 1.6% is the amount that is
controlled by the control grids.

The 1.6% that is controlled by the grids represents
approximately one-half the reactivity worth of the
shim-safety grids and covers the following: 0.6%
to counteract the negative temperature coefficient
of reactivity from 40 to 180°F, 0.3% excess re-
activity necessary to permit servo control, 0.6% to
counteract xenon buildup for 8 hr of operation at 5
Mw, and 0.1% for short-time burnup of U233,

The 0.3% allowed for the structural material in the
core region was determined by calculating the re-
activity change caused by deleting the U235 from
shells in the core region. An integral value was
obtained by summing, as a function of radius, the
areas of these shells which were intersected by
the cylindrical support members.

196

The 1.4% is to cover the fixed neutron absorbing
plates which will be mounted in the internal re-
flector region near areas of the core-reflector in-
terface not covered by the movable plates. These
plates may be adjusted when the reactor is unloaded «
so that some shimming may be done in the initial
loading, as long as sufficient excess reactivity is
left to provide 0.8% for U233 burnup.

A 2.0% excess was allowed for calculational
errors because the comparison of the calculation
with critical experiments showed an average error
of this amount,

The TSR-I| elements (see Fig. 4.5.14) have been
fabricated to contain the 8.1 kg of U2 established
as reported above, However, since the geometry of
the core permits only a limited adjustment of excess
reactivity by control plates and no means of adding
excess reactivity by the insertion of additional
fuel elements, the fuel elements have been assembled
in a temporary fashion so that the core loading can
be altered by changing a limited number of fuel
plates if a critical experiment should indicate that
it is necessary. Such a critical experiment will be .
performed at the Critical Experiments Facility.

When the fuel elements are assembled in their final
form the worth of the control plates will be deteri-
mined and some of the reactivity coefficients will be
measured.

CALCULATION OF HEATING IN
THE FUEL PLATES

A hand calculation was performed to estimate the
heating per fuel plate in each element. The source
distribution given in Fig. 4.5.13 was used to de-
termine the power distribution in each fuel plate
as a function of the length. The power generation
for some of the plates in the central fuel elements
is shown in Fig. 4.5.15 and for the annular elements
in Fig. 4.5.16. There are twelve annular elements
and eight central elements. The total power per
fuel plate was found by integrating the area under
the distribution plots for each fuel plate. The re-
sults are plotted as a function of the fuel plate
number for the central fuel elements in Fig. 4.5.17 .
and for the annular fuel elements in Fig. 4.5.18.
These values will be used in the flow distribution
studies to determine the required flow per fuel .

FLOW DISTRIBUTION STUDIES

Flow Studies of Central Fuel Elements

The hydraulic flow test stand which has been as-
sembled to test the confrol mechanisms under 1000-
gpm flow conditions is shown in Fig. 4.5.19, and
the complete piping arrangement and holdup tank is
shown in Fig. 4.5.20. This test stand will also be
used to study the flow distribution in the central
fuel elements and in the internal reflector region.
The stand will be extended to accommodate not only
the central fuel elements but also the lead-and-
water shield above the core region.

Flow Studies of Annular Fuel Elements
W. R. Gambill'? H. W. Hoffman'?2

The full-scale, quarter-sphere model constructed
for study of the flow features of the annular fuel
elements in the TSR-I| core is shown in two stages
of assembly in Figs. 4.5.21 and 4.5.22. Figure
4.5,21 shows the containment fixture, the ends of
an inner fuel plate assembly, and the separator
plate. In Fig. 4,5.22 the second-pass *‘‘orange

up cage. The groove in the head-end plate (shown
in the left lower corner of Fig. 4.5.22) receives a
pass rib which separates inlet and exit water fiows.

the inner surface of the Lucite shell and the outer
circumference of the outside fuel plates is approxi-
mately 0.5 in.

The static pressure drop across the full length of
every other flow channel is measured with manom-
eters connected to pressure taps located at channel
inlets and exits. Taps for the outer (second pass)
flow channels are visible in Fig. 4.5.21. The
manometer fluid is a CCl -1, solution.

The flow model, horizontal for the present tests,
will later be placed in a vertical position. The
flow rate is measured with a calibrated orifice and
a differential pressure (DP) cell, the nozzle inlet
and exit pressure with Bourdon-type gages, and
the water temperature with a standard Weston pipe-
line thermometer. The watertemperature may be

varied from 58 to 102°F with a steam-heated heat
exchanger. Tests to date have been made at a con-
stant flow rate of 250 gpm.

The measured static pressure drops for the model
in the ‘“‘as-received’’ state are shown in Fig. 4.5.23.
Variation of control plate position had very little
effect on the pressure drops for the second-pass
flow channels, as was expected; since all the first-
pass flow must reverse through the 0.5-in. gap
around the separator plate.

Extreme radial asymmetry of flow is evident. A
very large portion of the first-pass pressure drop
is apparently due to flow complications in the
central control cavity. It is probable that some sort
of coupled vortex flow pattern, induced by the
geometry and the control assembly mockup, exists
in the central cavity.

In the outer region of the core it was found that
most of the water entered the first seven channels
and that flow in the remaining outersregion channels
was either negligible or slightly reversed. Visual
observation of air bubbles, injected upstream of the
first pass, confirmed the right portion of Fig. 4.5.23.
Thus, it was observed that the bubbles streamed
through the first few channels but were in reverse
flow in the outermost channels.

Velocities have been calculated from the pressure-
drop data of Fig. 4.5,23. These are relatively un-
informative for the first pass because of the large
extraneous flow resistance associated with the
central cavity. For the uninterrupted channels of
the second pass, however, the results indicating
velocities from —2 to + 11 ft/sec are considered to
be valid. Calculations were based on the recent
parallel-plate relations given by Rothfus er al., 13
which indicate a Reynolds number of ~ 7000 as the
upper extension of the transition region or lowest
level of fully established turbulence.

Preliminary calculations indicate that the core
hydrodynamics will be more of a problem than the
heat transfer as such. |f velocities are sufficient
for full turbulence to exist, fuel element surface
temperatures will not exceed saturation temperatures
even at low static pressure levels, To maintain
full turbulence in all channels, however, a larger
total flow rate may be required. For a Reynolds
number of 7000 in each first-pass flow channel, a

total flow of 910 gpm is necessary; for the outer
region, a flow of 1380 gpm is required. These

tlow rates are based on an equivalent diameter

that is equal to twice the water gap between the
plates and an evaluation of viscesity at mean pass
temperatures (131°F for the first pass and 148°F
for the second pass). The fuel element surface-to-
centerline temperature rise appears to be negligible
for the worst operating condition.

The next test will be made with hot water and with
sealing strips around the equator of the outside re-
gion to stop a small bypass stream observed earlier,
Later tests will involve placing flow resistances
(perforated plates or screens) in the inlet ends of
the smaller-radius outer-region flow channels. It is
hoped that a redistribution of flow-satisfying heat-
transfer requirements can be attained in this fashion.
Flow redistribution in the first pass is potentially
a considerably more difficult problem, and studies
of first-pass flow have barely begun.

A flow test in which cold water will pass through
a single channel of an outside fuel-element section
is being prepared. The flow rate and static pressure
drop will be measured, and a calculated friction
factor vs Reynolds number plot should reveal the
extent of the transition region for the particular
entry conditions and curved fuel plates of the

TSR-]| reactor.

REACTOR CORE KINETIC STUDIES

The results of the initial kinetic studies of the
reactor core, which were made on the ORNL Re-
actor Controls Analog Facility, 4 are presented
here without analysis. The first two cases were
run to determine how well the control mechanism
could protect the reactor without the inherent safety
features of a heterogeneous reactor. Three other
cases were run to partially investigate the self-
limiting features of the reactor based on the temper-
ature coefficient of reactivity.

With the reactor system simulator operating at an
initial power of 5 Mw and in a prompt critical con-
dition, excess reactivity was added and the simu-
lator delayed neutron circuits were closed. The re-
sulting power excursion was recorded and the safety
rods were allowed to drop when a level of 7.5 Mw
was reached. Concurrent with the reactor power

excursion the mean temperature of the exit fuel
section was recorded. Both the power excursion
data and the mean temperature are plotted on Fig.
4,5.24a. The net negative temperature coefficient
of the reactor was disconnected; hence no limiting
effects of temperature coefficient were present.
For purposes of comparison, the time vs reactivity
profile of the safety grids is plotted on the same
figure (see Fig. 4.5,246). The same type of in-
formation for an initial power of 5 Mw and a level
trip at 6 Mw is presented in Fig. 4.5.25. The
safety grid profile shows that the insertion time for
the grids was longer in this case.

With the reactor operating at an initial power of
0.5 Mw and with the net temperature coefficient of
the reactor “‘active,’’ the water temperature leaving
the air cooler was reduced from 145.8 to 32°F.
(There is an approximately 130-sec delay time be-
fore the water reaches the reactor.) The resultant
power excursion and system temperature changes
are plotted as functions of time in Fig. 4.5.26.

The value which was used for the temperature
coefficient of reactivity (Ak/k) was ~6.5%. Later
calculations and critical experiments show the
value to be near that of the BSF (see above).
These cases will be re-run. Figure 4.5.27 pre-
sents the same type of data for an initial power of
S Mw,

With the reactor operating at 5 Mw, an abrupt stop
in cooling water flow was also simulated, The re-
sulting reactor power and system temperature changes

are plotted in Fig. 4.5.28.

SAFETY SYSTEM MEASUREMENTS
J. E. Marks

The evaluation of the TSR-I[ Safety System was
based upon a value of delay time and a time function
of control plate position that were determined ex-
perimentally with a test assembly incorporating the
best designs of the proposed system components.
The measuring techniques described below were
considered capable of yielding the accuracy re-
quired for a reliable reactor analysis.

The test assembly included a simulated sigma bus
circuit, a standard magnet amplifier, an electro-
hydraulic transducer, and a control mechanism with
connections between these components similar to
those expected in the final reactor assembly. A
differential transformer type of linear motion trans-
ducer was mechanically connected to the control
plate to translate the position of the plate into a

3000-cps differential voltage. This voltage was
applied to a cathode-ray oscilloscope with a
200-msec sweep period initiated by the same change
in sigma bus voltage as that which initiated the
scram. The plot of position vs time that resulted
was calibrated in tenths of an inch between the
limits of travel of the control plate. The plate was
considered to have started and stopped moving when
the slope of the curve left and retumed to zero.

The delay time was measured by using the change
of sigma bus potential that initiated the scram to

simultaneously trigger the sweep of the oscilloscope.

The length of sweep from the point it began to the
first discontinuity was taken as an indication of the
*‘dead’’ time between initiation of a scram signal
and the first perceptible motion of the control plate.

SHIELD DESIGNS

The design criteria for the beam shield which will
be used initially with the TSR-ll were that (1) on a

210

Reactor initially at 5 Mw.

rem basis and with an rbe of 10 for fast neutrons,
there was to be an equal number of gamma rays

and fast neutrons at the reactor shield surface, and
(2) the background dose at the crew compartment
from the beam shield 64 ft away was to be a factor
of 50 to 100 less than that produced from a beam at
right angles to the reactor-crew compartment axis.
With these criteria and a gamma-ray shield of 50-50
volume per cent lead and water, the following shield
dimensions were obtained.'® The lead-and-water
gamma-ray shield should be 43 ¢m thick with an
inner radius of 48 cm. The water neutron shield
should be 81 cm thick, which gives an outer shield
radius of 172 cm, Thus, the shield will contain
33,500 Ib of lead and 42,900 |b of water. The

ANP, Cincinnati, Ohio.

gamma-ray shield is being investigated. The
beam holes will be stepped halfway through the
shield, with the outer cylinder 15 in. in diameter
and the inner cylinder 10 in. in diameter., The
Laboratory is proceeding with the design of this
shield with the additional criterion that it must be
self-supporting when it is placed on the ground.

A second high-performance shield for the TSR-I
is being designed by the Y-12 Engineering Depart-
ment according to specifications set by Pratt &
Whitney Aircraft. The shield will utilize a de-
pleted uranium gamma-ray shadow shield and a
lithium hydride neutron shield. [t will be fabricated
in the Y-12 shops and is scheduled to be completed
by May 1, 1959. The estimated cost of the shield is
$330,000.

INVESTIGATION OF STRESSES IN THE TOWER
STRUCTURE FROM WATER AND
ELECTRICAL LINES

An investigation has been made !¢ to determine
whether water hoses and electrical cables can be
suspended from the reactor support cables and
tower legs without exceeding the allowable stresses
in the tower structure.

The investigation was carried out for the following
conditions:

1. weight of reactor = 55 tons,

2. weight of crew compartment = 30 tons,

3. 80-mph wind (20 psf),

4, two water hoses, each 170 ft long and weighing
25 Ib/ft,

5. four electrical cables, each 170 ft long and
weighing 2.75 |b/ft.

The reactor and crew compartment were considered

to be in the plane of normal operation, that is, in the

16, A, McCarthy, Report of Investigation for the
TSF-1I, McPherson Co., July 1958,

SO PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 1958

vertical plane bisecting the longitudinal axis of the
Tower Shielding Facility (east and west) and ex-
tending 200 ft from the ground level.

The water hoses and electrical cables were as-
sumed to be symmetrically positioned from tower
legs | and Il. One end of each hose and each cable
was considered to be attached at a distance of
123 ft 6 in. above the base of the leg and the other
end was considered to be attached to the reactor
support cables at a point 33 ft from the reactor.

The calculations were compared to a similar cal-
culation made in connection with the original de-
sign of Knappen-Tippetts-Abbott-McCarthy (KTAM). 7
The calculation by KTAM did not take into account
items 4 and 5 above and showed the allowable
stresses in the tower legs to be:

1. as given by KTAM, 19.90 ksi, and

2. allowed by AISC code, 19.55 ksi.

The stresses in the tower legs determined in this

calculation are:

1. before addition of water hoses and electrical
cables, 18,072 ksi, and

2. after addition of water hoses and electrical
cables, 19.545 ksi.

In the calculation it was assumed that the electrical

cables and water lines were rigidly fastened to the

tower legs. In the present design all four electrical

cables will be suspended from Leg | and one water

hose will be suspended from Leg | and the other

from Leg Il. However, the suspension arrangement,

which is shown in Fig. 4.5.29, eliminates the greater

portion of the horizontal load in the tower legs by

shifting it to the deadmen which now anchor the

tower legs.
