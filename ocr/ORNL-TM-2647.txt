HASTELIOY N SURVEILILANCE SPECIMENS — THIRD GROUP

 

 

H. E. McCoy, Jr.

ABSTRACT

We have examined the third group of Hastelloy N
surveillance samples removed from the Molten-Salt
Reactor Experiment. ©Standard Hastelloy N was removed
from the core after exposure to a thermal fluence of
9.4 x 10°° neutrons/cm® over a time period of 15,289 hr
at 650°C and from outside the reactor vessel after
exposure to a thermal fluence of 2.6 x 101° neutrons/cm2
over a time period of 20,789 hr at 650°C. The former
samples were exposed to the fuel salt and the later
samples were exposed to nitrogen plus 2 to 5% 0. The
material seemed dquite compatible with both environments,
Postirradiation tests showed that the fracture strain
was reduced at 25°C and above 500°C, The reduction in
ductility at 25°C is likely due to carbide precipitation
and the reduction above 500°C is due to the presence
of helium from the °B(N,x)”Li transmutation. The
accumulated results in this series of experiments allow
us to follow the changes in fracture strain over the
thermal fluence range 1.3 x 10'% to 9.4 x 10°° neutrons/cm?,

Two heats of modified Hastelloy N were removed
from the core after irradiation to a thermal fluence of
5.3 x 10%<° neu.trons/cm2 over a time period of 9789 hr
at 650°C. The postirradiation properties of these
alloys were better than those of standard Hastelloy N.

 

INTRODUCTION

The Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) is a single region reactor
that is fueled by a molten fluoride salt (65 LiF—29.1 BeF,—5 ZrF,-0.9 UF,,
mole %), moderated by unclad graphite, and contained by Hastelloy N
(Ni—16 Mo—7 Cr—4 Fe—0.05 C, wt %). The details of the reactor design

and construction can be found elsewhere.1 We knew that the neutron

tion of Reactor Design, ORNL-TM-728 (January 1965).

 

 
environment would produce some changes in the two structural materials —

graphite and Hastelloy N. Although we were very confident of the com-

patibility of these materials with the fluoride salt, we needed to keep -
abreast of the possible development of corrosion problems within the v
reactor itself, TFor these reasons, we developed a surveillance program >

that would allow us to follow the property changes of graphite and
Hastelloy N specimens as the reactor operated.

The reactor went critical on June 1, 1965, and after numerous small
problems were solved, assumed normal operation in May 1966, We have
removed three groups of surveillance samples and the results of tests on

253 were

the Hastelloy N specimens from the first and second groups
reported previously. This report will deal primarily with the results

of tests on the Hastelloy N samples removed with the third group of sur-
veillance samples. The third group included two heats of standard
Hastelloy N that had been used in fabricating the MSRE and two heats

with modified chemistry that had better mechanical properties after irra-
diation and appear attractive for use in future molten-salt reactors.

The respective history of each lot was (1) standard Hastelloy N, exposed
in the MSRE cell to an environment of N, + 2 to 5% 0, for 20,789 hr at
650°C to a thermal fluence of 2.6 x 1017 neutrons/em®, (2) standard
Hastelloy N, exposed in the MSRE core to fluoride salt for 15,289 hr at
650°C to a thermal fluence of 9.4 x 10°° neutrons/cm®, and (3) modified
Hastelloy N, exposed in the MSRE core to fluoride salt for 9789 hr at
650°C to a thermal fluence of 5.3 x 10°° neutrons/ecm*. The results of

tests on these materials will be presented in detail and some comparisons

will be made with the data from the groups removed previously.

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

Surveillance Assemblijes

The core surveillance assembly was designed by W. H. Cook and
others, and the details have been reported previously.4 The specimens
are arranged in three stringers, Each stringer is about 62 in. long and
consists of two Hastelloy N rods and a graphite section made up of vari-
ous pieces that are joined by pinning and tongue-and-groove Jjoints. The
Hastelloy N rod has periodic-reduced sections 1 1/8 in. long by 1/8 in,
in diameter and can be cut into small tensile specimens after it is
removed from the reactor. Three stringers are Jjoined together so that
they can be separated in a hot cell and reassembled with one or more new
stringers for reinsertion into the reactor. The assembled stringers fit
into a perforated Hastelloy N basket that is inserted into an axial posi-
tion about 3.6 in. from the core center line.

A control facility is associated with the surveillance program. It
utilizes a "fuel salt" containing depleted uranium in a static pot that
is heated electrically. The temperature is controlled by the MSRKE com-
puter so that the temperature matches that of the reactor. Thus, these
specimens are exposed to conditions similar to those in the reactor
except for the static salt and the absence of a neutron flux.

There is another surveillance facility for Hastelloy N located out-~
side the core in a vertical position about 4.5 in. from the vessel.

These specimens are exposed to the cell environment of Nz + 2 to 5% 0z,

Materials

The compositions of the two heats of standard Hastelloy N are given
in Table 1. These heats were air melted by Stellite Division of Union
Carbide Corporation. Heat 5085 was used for making the cylindrical por-

tion of the reactor vessel and heat 5065 was used for forming the top

and bottom heads., These materials were given a mill anneal of 1 hr at
1177°C and a final anneal of 2 hr at 900°C at ORNL after fabrication.
The chemical compositions of the two modified alloys are given in
Table 1. The modifications in composition were made principally to
improve the alloy's resistance to radiation damage and to bring about
general improvements in the fabricability, weldability, and ductility.5
These alloys were small 100-1b heats made by Stellite Division of Union

welded together to make 62-in,-long rods for fabricating the samples.
The rods were annealed for 1 hr at 1177°C in argon and then the reduced

sections were machined,

Test Specimens

The surveillance rods inside the core are 62 in. long and those
outside the vessel are 84 in. long. They both are 1/4 in. in diameter
with reduced sections 1/8 in. in diameter by 1 1/8 in. long. After
removal from the reactor, the rods are sawed into small mechanical prop-
erty specimens having a gage section 1/8 in. in diameter by 1 1/8 in.
long.

The first rods were machined as segments and then welded together,
but we described previously an improved technique in which we use a
milling cutter to machine the reduced sections in the rod.” This tech-
nique is quicker, cheaper, and requires less handling of the relatively

fragile rods than the previous method of making the rods into segments.

IRRADIATION CONDITIONS

The jrradiation conditions for the three groups of surveillance
specimens that have been removed are summarized in Table 2. The environ-
ment in the core facility is the molten-fluoride fuel salt. The speci-
mens outside the core {designated ''vessel" specimens) are exposed to the

cell environment of Nz + 2 to 5% O».

Testing Techniques

The laboratory creep-rupture tests of unirradiated control specimens
were run in conventional creep machines of the dead-load and lever-arm
types. The strain was measured by a dial indicator that showed the
total movement of the specimen and part of the load train. The zero
strain measurement was taken immediately after the load was applied.

The femperature accuracy was *0.75%, the guaranteed accuracy of the

Chromel-P—Alumel thermocouples used.

The postirradiation creep-rupture tests were run in lever-arm
machines that were located in hot cells., The strain was measured by an
extensometer with rods attached to the upper and lower specimen grips.
The relative movement of these two rods was measured by a linear differ-
ential transformer, and the transformer signal was recorded. The accu-
racy of the strain measurement is difficult to determine, The
extensometer (mechanical and electrical portions) produced measurements
that could be read to about *0.02% strain; however, other factors (tem-
perature changes in the cell, mechanical vibrations, etc.) probably com-
bined to give an overall accuracy of #0.1% strain. This is considerably
better than the specimen-to-specimen reproducibility that one would
expect for relatively brittle materials. The temperature measuring and
control system was the same as that used in the laboratory with only one
exception. In the laboratory, the control system was stabilized at the
desired temperature by use of a recorder with an expanded scale. 1In the
tests in the hot cells, the control point was established by setting the
controller without the aid of the expanded-scale recorder, This error
and the thermocouple accuracy combine to give a temperature uncertainty
of about *1%,

The tensile tests were run on Instron Universal Testing Machines.
The strain measurements were taken from the crosshead travel and gener-
ally are accurate to *2% strain.

The test environment was air in all cases., Metallographic examina-
tion showed that the depth of oxidation was small and we feel that the

environment did not appreciably influence the test results.
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

Visual and Metallographic Examination

W, H. Cook was in charge of the disassembly of the core surveillance
fixture. As shown in Fig. 1 the assembly was in excellent mechanical
condition when removed., The graphite and Hastelloy N surfaces were very

clean with markings such as numbers and tool marks clearly visible. The

Hastelloy N was discolored slightly. The Hastelloy N surveillance rods
outside the reactor vessel were oxidized, bﬁt the oxide was tenacious.
We examined polished cross sections of segments from each of the
surveillance rods., Typical micrographs of the reods of standard
Hastelloy N that were located outside the reactor vessel are shown in
Figs. 2 and 3. The cell environment of N> + 2 to 5% 02 is oxidizing to
the alloy, but there is no evidence of nitriding. There is some inter-
nal oxidation to a depth of 1 to 2 mils and a very thin uniform surface
oxide. The general microstructure is characterized by large MgC-type
carbides that are distributed ,during' the primary working and by finer
MgC-type carbides that formed during ‘the Jong thermal anneal of
20,789 hr at 650°C. | |

Typical photomicrographs of the standard Hastelloy N samples
exposed to the MSRE fuel salt for 15,289 hr at 650°C are shown in
Figs. 4 and 5. There is a thin layer of modified structure less than
0.5 mil thick at the surface. This modified structure was noted pre-
viously.6 As shown in Figs. 6 and 7, a similar product is formed on
the surfaces of the control specimens. We originally suspected that
this product formed only where the Hastelloy N was in intimate contact
with graphite, but a closer examination shows that the modified struc-
ture exists around the complete circumference of the rod and not Just
where it makes tangential contact with graphite. From the practical
standpoint, the modified layer has not changed detectably since we first
observed the samples removed after 4800 hr of exposure and we feel that
it will not influence the mechanical properties of the material.

The amount of fine MgC-type precipitates is not detectably differ-
ent for the material aged while being irradiated (Figs. 4 and 5) and
that aged in the absence of irradiation (Figs. 6 and 7). There does
seem to be more precipitate present in heat 5065 than in heat 5085, an
observation in keeping with the higher carbon content of heat 5065
(Table 1, p. 4). Extracted precipitates were found to be of the MC type
with a lattice parameter of 11.02 A. Some of the material exposed to the
highest thermal fluence of 9.4 X 10<° neu.trons/bm2 was examined in trans-
mission., A typical electron photomicrograph is shown in Fig. 8 where
helium bubbles are clearly visible along several of the grain boundaries.
This sample had not been stressed and the rather large sizes of these
bubbles attests to the initial inhomogeneous distribution of the boron.
However, the observation of bubbles of this size only serves to support
the formation of gas bubbles in metals during irradiation and really is
not informative from a mechanistic standpoint. Deformation takes place
on an atomistic scale (few angstroms) and our ability to see details in
the grain boundaries of such specimens is limited to about 50 A, so we

are not yet able to see details of the size involved in deformation.

Typical photomicrographs of the modified Hastelloy N are shown in
Figs. 9 and 10. The grain size in this material is rather large due to
the high preirradiation anneal of 1 hr at 1177°C and the absence of the
carbide stringers. There is a thin layer on the surface, which has the
appearance of being a deposit rather than where material has been removed
by corrosion. X-ray studies indicate the presence of iron. Since these
alloys contain only trace quantities of iron compared with 4 to 5% for the
rest of the material in the MSRE and in the control facility, it is quite
reasonable that iron should be deposited on the surfaces of the modified
alloys. The general microstructure contains a finely dispersed precipi-

tate with larger amounts along the grain boundaries.

Tensile Properties

 

The postirradiation tensile properties of heat 5085 after exposure
to the cell enviromment of Np + 2 to 5% 0p for 20,789 hr are given in
Table A-1 (Appendix) and the fracture strain is plotted as a function of
test temperature in Fig. 11. There are significant reductions in the
fracture strain at 25°C and above 500°C. The fracture strain decreased
with decreasing strain rate at the elevated temperatures. One particu-
larly interesting observation was that the fracture strain at room tem-
perature could be improved by a postirradiation anneal of & hr at 870°C.
This anneal is quite often used as a postweld anneal and is sufficient
to precipitate (or redissolve) carbides and to relieve residual stresses,
but does not cause grain-boundary motion. Thus, the recovery of the
room-temperature ductility by this anneal supports the supposition that
the reduction in ductility at 25°C is due to carbide precipitation.

The results of tensile tests on heat 5065 after exposure to the
MSRE cell environment for 20,789 hr at 650°C are given in Table A-2
(Appendix) and the fracture strain is shown as a function of test tem-
perature in Fig. 12. This heat does not exhibit the reduction in duc-
tility at 25°C, but does show a substantial loss in ductility above
500°C due to irradiation. The effect of strain rate is qualitatively
the same as that shown in Fig. 11 for heat 5085, but the scatter in

experimental results does not allow a quantitative comparison.

Heats 5085 and 5065 were also removed from the core surveillance
and control facilities after 15,289 hr of exposure. The detailed ten-
sile data on these specimens are given in Tables A-3 through A-6
(Appendix). The variation of the fracture strain with test temperature
is shown in Fig. 13 for heat 5085 after exposure in the core surveil-
lance facility to a thermal fluence of 9.4 x 10°° neutrons/cm2 and in
Fig. 14 for heat 5085 after exposure in the control facility. The irra-
diated samples (Fig. 13) showed reduced fracture strains compared with
the control samples (Fig. 14) over the entire test temperature range
studied. ©Similar plots of the variation of fracture strain with test
temperature are shown for heat 5065 after removal from the core surveil-
lance facility (Fig. 15) and the control facility (Fig. 16). There is a
slight reduction in the fracture strain at 25°C due to irradiation, but
the reduction is not nearly as great as noted for heat 5085 (Fig. 13).
The fracture strain of heat 5065 is reduced above 500°C by irradiation,
and the resulting strains are lower than those for heat 5085 (Fig. 13).
For example, at a test temperature of 650°C and a strain rate of
0.002 min~! heat 5085 (Fig. 13) fractures at a strain of 5% and heat 5065
(Fig. 15) fractures at 3.5%. The unirradiated samples from the control
facility show a greater reduction in fracture strain for heat 5085
(Fig. 14) than for heat 5065 (Fig. 16) at 25°C, but the fracture strains
at 650°C are not appreciably different for the two heats.

Heat 5085 has been carried throughout our surveillance program, so
we now have accumulated enough data to see how the fracture strain is
varying with neutron fluence. The fracture strain is shown as a function
of test temperature in Fig. 17 for heat 5085. Generally, the fracture
strain is decreased with increasing fluence. At low fluence the ductil-
ity reduction at low test temperatures is restricted to 25°C and recovers
at higher test temperatures, but at higher fluences the fracture strain
is reduced over a wider temperature range. We attribute this embrittle-
ment to carbide precipitation and, as shown in Fig. 11, the ductility can
be recovered by postirradiation annealing. The ductility reduction above
500°C is associated with the presence of helium and the increased ten-
dency for intergranular fracture. The fracture strain at a given temper-

ature above 500°C generally decreases with increasing thermal fluence.

The fracture strains for heat 5085 at a slower strain rate, 0.002 min™-,

are shown in Fig. 18. The behavior as a function of fluence is similar
to that shown in Fig. 17 at a higher strain rate. An important excep-

tion is the observation that as the test temperature is increased, the

fracture strain depends on fluence to a lesser extent.

One very important question that arises is "How much of the reduc-
tion in fracture strain in Fig. 17 can be attributed to thermal aging?"
Several of the tensile results obtained on samples from the control
facility are shown in Fig. 19. The results show generally that the
fracture strain is reduced at all test temperatures by aging at 650°C.
However, the reductions in fracture strain due to aging do not account
for nearly all the reduction noted for irradiated samples. For example,
the fracture strains at test temperatures of 25 and 650°C are 53.0 and
33.6% for as-annealed samples, 38.6 and 19.6% after aging for 15,289 hr
at 650°C (Fig. 19), and 28.5 and 11.0% after irradiation to a fluence
of 9.4 x 102° neutrons/cm? over a period of 15,289 hr at 650°C. We do

not have as much data on the response of heat 5065 to aging, but a

comparison of Figs. 14 and 16, pp. 22 and 23, of the fracture strain for
heats 5065 and 5085 after aging for 15,289 hr at 650°C indicates very
similar properties of the two heats at 650°C and higher fracture strain
for heat 5065 at 25°C.

The combined observations on the change in the fracture strain at
a test temperature of 25°C are shown in Fig. 20, The results are plotted
as if aging time were the controlling variable, and the results on the
unirradiated samples (open symbols) indicate that aging time is an impor-
tant factor. However, for the cases where irradiated and unirradiated
samples were tested after similar thermal histories, the irradiated sam-
ples showed the larger reduction in fracture strain. Thus, neutron
fluence as well as time at temperature are important factors in the
reduction of the fracture strain at low temperatures. The question of
whether the role of irradiation is to produce defects that enhance the
growth rates of precipitates or to produce transmutation products that
aid in stabilizing a precipitate nucleus yet remains unanswered. The
data shown for heat 5065 in Fig. 20 indicate that this material is less
susceptible to this type of embrittlement than heat 5085,

A stress-rupture plot for heat 5085 is shown in Fig. 21. The
results obtained on the unirradiated samples show that the rupture life
is reduced slightly by prolonged aging at 650°C, the magnitude of the
effect decreasing with decreasing stress level, The rupture life is

decreased markedly by irradiation even at thermal fluences as low as

1.3 x 10%° neutrons/cmz. The rupture life is reduced progressively by
increasing fluence with a large step occurring between fluences of
1.3 and 9.4 x 10°° neutrons /cm®.

The minimum creep rate is shown as a function of stress level in
Fig. 22 for these same samples from heat 5085. The results on unirradi-
ated samples show that the creep rate is increased slightly at high
stfess levels by prolonged aging at 650°C. A few irradiated samples
tested at high stress levels and the samples irradiated to
9.4 x 1020 neutrons/bm2 have a higher minimum creep rate, This is likely
due to the tests being so short and the fracture strains so low that the
steady-state creep period (the period in which the minimum creep rate
usually occurs) was not reached and the rate that we measured was too
high. However, generally at lower stress levels irradiation and aging
seem to have little effect on the minimum creep rate.

The -fracture strains are shown as a function of minimum creep rate
in Fig. 23 for the irradiated samples of heat 5085, The scatterband
shown in this figure was determined from numerous tests on samples of
these same heats of standard Hastelloy N that had been irradiated in the
Oak Ridge Research Reactor (ORR) to thermal fluences of 2 to
5 x 10°9 neutrons/émz. In samples removed from the MSRE the fracture
strain was decreased from about 20% for unirradiated material to about
2.3% by a thermal fluence of 1.3 x 10%° neutrons/cmz. Progressively
higher fluences reduced the fracture strain even further. The limited
number of data points for each lot of material do not give a very strong
indication of the very distinct ductility minimum noted in our ORR irra-
diations. This may be associated with the much larger times involved in
the MSRE irradiations (5000 to 20,000 hr) compared with those in the
ORR (1000 hr).

The effects of aging in the absence of irradiation on the fracture
strain of heat 5085 at 650°C are shown in Fig. 24, After annealing for
2 hr at 900°C the fracture strain is 30 to 40%, almost independent of
strain rate. After aging for 4800 hr at 650°C the fracture strains are
now in the range of 20 to 30%. Aging for 15,289 hr causes a small
further reduction in the fracture strain at high strain rates, but no

significant change in the fracture strain at low strain rates. Thus, the

STRAIN RATE (%/hr)

Fig. 24. Influence of Aging at €50°C on the Fracture Strain of
Hastelloy N (Heat 5085) When Tested at 650°C.

fracture strain in a sample strained at a rate of 0.1%/hr at 650°C is
about 20% for heat 5085 after aging 15,289 hr at 650°C (Fig. 24) and
only 0.5% (Fig. 23) after a thermal fluence of 9.4 X 10°9 neutrons/cm®.

The results of our stress-rupture tests on heat 5065 are summarized
in Fig. 25. Contrary to the behavior of heat 5085 (Fig. 21), thermal
aging seems to have no effect on the creep-rupture properties of
heat 5065. However, the rupture life is reduced appreciably by irradia-
tion and the resulting lifetimes at a given stress are quite comparable
for heats 5065 and 5085,

The minimum creep rate is shown as a function of stress level for
heat 5065 in Fig. 26. The minimum creep rate is increased slightly by
thermal aging at 650°C. The creep rates seem to be high for some of the
irradiated samples, but this is likely associated with the fracture
strain being so low that the minimum creep rate was not established.

The variation of fracture strain with minimum creep rate for the
irradiated samples of heat 5065 is shown in Fig. 27. The ductility of
this heat is about the same as that shown in Fig. 23 for heat 5085,

except for the material irradiated to a thermal fluence of

9.4 x 10°° neutrons/em® for which heat 5065 has much lower fracture
strains.

Our observations on the variation of fracture strain of surveillance
specimens with strain rate are summarized in Fig. 28. Data are included
in this figure for both tensile and creep tests. The scatterband based
on our observations on samples irradiated in the ORR is also shown in
Fig., 28 (ref. 9)., The fracture strain varies widely with fluence at
high strain rates and varies much less at low strain rates. At low
strain rates, the fracture strains for the samples irradiated to
1.3 x 10%° neutrons/cm2 fall above the scatterband and those for samples

irradiated to 9.4 x 10°C neutrons/cm? fall below the scatterband.

Mechanical Property Data — Modified Hastelloy N

Tensile Properties

 

Two heats of modified Hastelloy N (Table 1, p. 4) were included in
both the core surveillance facility and the control facility.
Heat 67-502 contained a nominal 0.5% Ti and 2% W and heat 67-504 con-
tained a nominal addition of 0.5% Hf. These samples were exposed to
salt 9789 hr at 650°C and those in the MSRE received a thermal neutron
flvence of 5.3 x 10°° neutrons/em®. The detailed results of tensile
tests on these materials are given in Tables A-10 through A-13 (Appendix).

L are compared in

The fracture strains at a strain rate of 0.05 min~
Fig. 29 for the modified alloys. In the unirradiated condition,
heat 67-502 had higher fracture strains than heat 67-504 up to about
600°C where the opposite trend was noted. The shapes of these curves
are different from those shown in Figs. 14 and 16, pp. <22 and 23, for
the standard alloy. The fracture strain of the standard alloy decreases
rapidly with increasing temperature above about 500°C and a ductility
minimum occurs at about 650°C, For the modified alloys, the fracture
strain does not begin to decrease with temperature until about ©600°C
and the strain continues to decrease up to 850°C, the highest tempera-
ture investigated. The fracture strains of the modified alloys after
irradiation, also shown in Fig. 29, are reduced at temperatures above
about 500°C., Both alloys have about the same fracture strains, and a
comparison with Fig. 17, p. 24, shows that the modified alloys irradi-
ated to 5.3 X 10°° neutrons/ecm® have better fracture strains than those
of the standard alloy irradiated to 1.3 x 10%° neutrons/ém?. One test
indicates that the fracture strain of heat 67-504 at 25°C may be reduced
by irradiation. This will have to be checked further.

The fracture strains observed in tensile tests at a strain rate of
0.002 min~! for heat 67-502 and -504 are shown in Fig. 30, The postirra-
diation properties of the two heats are about the same and, although
reduced considerably by irradiation, they are much better than those

shown in Fig. 18, p. 25, for standard Hastelloy N.

Creep-Rupture Properties

 

The results of creep-rupture tests on heats 67-502 and -504 are
given in Tables A-14 and A-15 (Appendix). The stress-rupture properties
of heat 67-502 are shown in Fig. 31. Aging for 9789 hr at 650°C
increased the rupture life by about 30% and neutron irradiation to a
fluence of 5.3 x 1070 neu.‘trons/cm2 decreased the rupture life by about
30% compared with the as-annealed material, The minimum creep rate,
shown in Fig., 32, was increased by the aging treatment and the samples
that were aged and irradiated simultaneously had the same minimum creep
rates as the as-annealed material.

The creep-rupture strength of heat 67-504 (Fig. 33) was not altered
appreciably by aging at 650°C, However, irradiation decreased the rup-
ture life of the material by about 50%. The minimum creep rate (Fig. 34)
was increased by the combined irradiation and aging treatment, but was
increased even more by Jjust the aging treatment.

The fracture strains of heats 67-502 and -504 at 650°C are shown
in Fig. 35 as a function of strain rate. In the unirradiated condition,
both heats show a trend of decreasing fracture strain with decreasing
strain rate. Aging improves the fracture strain of both heats and irra-
diation decreases the fracture strain, The irradiated material has a

fracture strain of about 6% under creep conditions.

Metallographic Examination of Mechanical Property Specimens

Several of the tested samples were examined metallographically.
Photomicrographs are shown in Fig. 36 for a sample of heat 5085 that was
tensile tested at 25°C after being exposed to the cell environment for
20,789 hr at 650°C. The fracture under these test conditions would
normally be transgranular, but the fracture shown in Fig. 36 is primarily
intergranular. This change in fracture mode probably accounts for the
fracture strain of this sample being only 33% (Fig. 11, p. 20) compared
with about 55% for unirradiated, unaged material. The photomicrographs
shown in Fig. 37 were made on another sample of heat 5085 from outside
the vessel that was tested at 650°C. The fracture is largely intergran-

ular and there are very few cracks near the fracture,

tested at 25°C is shown in Fig. 38. The fracture is still partially
intergranular, but the elongated grains indicate that the sample strained
a large amount before failing. As shown in Fig. 12, p. 20, this sample
had a fracture strain of 59.5%. . A sample of heat 5065 was tested at
600°C and typical phdtomicrographs'are shown in Fig. 39. The fracture
strain of this sample was only lf% and the fracture is predominately
intergranular. . |

The thin oxide surface layers do not seem to influence the deforma-
tion in the samples from.outside the vessel., The amount of edge cracking
noted in Figs. 36 through 39 is not unusual for Hastelloy N.

, _Typical_photomicrographs of a sample of heat 5085 aged for 15,289 hr
at 650°C in staticrbarfen fuel salt and tested at 200°C are shown in
Fig. 40. The fracture strain of this sample was quite good (Fig. 14,
p. 22) although the fracture is partiaelly intergranular. A cross section
from the stressed portion of this sample is shown in Fig. 40(b) and shows
that the surface structural modification extends to a depth of about
3 mils. Figure 40(c) gives some further insight into the origin of the
modified structure. The surface indentations are engraved identifica-
tion numbers and would have involved heavy cold working. Note that the
modified structure extends to a greater depth under these impressions.
The febrication sequence was (1) rods fabricated to approximate diameter,
(2) rod segments welded together, (3) annealed for 2 hr at 900°C in
argon, (4) sinterless ground to final diameter, (5) gage portions milled,
(6) identification numbers engraved, and (7) samples put into surveillance
facility. Thus, all surfaces were cold worked; the major diameter by
grinding and the gage diameter by milling., The resulting miéroétructure
likely results from carbide précipitation on the dislocations introduced
by cold working. |

photomicrographs [Fig. 41(a) and (b)] show that the large carbides
actually fracture during testing. Some of these cracks may propagate
and contribute to fracture. (This fracturing occurs in unirradiated and
irradiated samples when tested at relatively low temperatures, e.g.,
Figs. 36, 38, and 40.) There is a very thin layer of the modified struc-
ture near the surface of the tested sample [Fig. 41(d)], but the amount
of edge cracking is not unusually high for a sample that has strained
36% (Fig. 13, p. 22).

The fracture of a sample of heat 5085 that was tested at 650°C
after exposure to a static barren fuel salt for 15,289 hr at 650°C is
shown in Fig. 42. The fracture is mixed transgranular and intergranular
and there is considerable evidence of carbide fracturing. By contrast,
the fracture shown in Fig. 43 is primarily intergranular. The sample in
Fig. 43 was irradiated to a thermal fluence of 2.4 x 10°° neutrons/cm2
and tested at 650°C. At the low fracture strain of only 5% (Fig. 13,
p. 22) there is little evidence of plastic deformation with only a few
fractured carbides and some separations at the carbide-metal interfaces
[Fig. 43(b)].

Samples of heat 5065 that were irradiated to a thermal fluence of
2.4 x 10%° neu.trons/cm2 and the thermal controls both had fracture
strains of over 40% when tested at 25°C (Figs. 15 and 16, p. 23). The
fractures of these samples appear quite similar (Figs. 44 and 45). The
fractures are largely intergranular although the grains have deformed
extensively. ©Some edge cracking occurred on both samples,

When tested at 650°C an unirradiated sample of heat 5065 had a
fracture with transgranular and intergranular components (Fig. 46).
This sample had a fracture strain of about 17% (Fig. 16, p. 23) compared
with 3.5% (Fig. 15, p. 23) for a comparable sample irradiated to a
thermal fluence of 9.4 x 1020 neutrons/cmz. The irradiated sample has
an intergranular fracture with very limited intergranular and carbide
cracking (Fig. 47). The modified layer near the surface has not deformed
differently from the remaining sample. The fracture of a sample modified
with titanium (heat 67-502) that was exposed to barren fuel salt for
9789 hr at 650°C and tested at 25°C is shown in Fig. 48. The grains have
deformed extensively although the fracture is largely intergranular.

Further photomicrographs of the unstressed portion of this same sample
are shown in Fig. 49. There is a very fine carbide precipitate through-
out this sample and our other studies indicate that these are likely
carbides of the MyC or MC types.lo The grain boundaries also etch quite
heavily indicating the presence of heavy grain-boundary precipitation.
The surface of the sample has a very thin layer that is rich in iron.
This is likely a deposit since this alloy is very low in iron and the
rest of the system is fabricated of material that contains 4 to 5% Fe.

A sample of heat 67-502 that was irradiated and tested at 25°C is
shown in Fig, 50, The fracture strain of this sample was about as high
as that for the unirradiated sample (Fig. 29, p. 35), but the grains are
not nearly as elongated in the irradiated sample (Fig. 50) as in the
unirradiated sample (Fig. 48). There are considerably more grain-
boundary cracks in the irradiated sample than in the unirradiated sample.

The fracture of a sample of heat 67-502 that was exposed to barren
fuel salt for 9789 hr and tested at 650°C is shown in Fig. 51. The
fracture is transgranular, an observation consistent with the extremely
high fracture strain of this sample (Fig. 29, p. 35).

The fracture at 25°C of heat 67-504 (Fig. 52) is quite similar to
that noted for heat 67-502 (Fig. 48). Heat 67-504 is modified with
0.5% Hf and the photomicrographs in Fig. 53 indicate that there may be
more precipitate in this alloy than in heat 67-502 that was modifed with
0.5% Ti and 2% W, However, the apparent amount of precipitation is very
dependent upon the etching procedure, This heat of material is also
very low in iron and iron deposition was noted [Fig. 53(a)l.

The fracture of an irradiated sample of heat 67-504 tested at 25°C
is shown in Fig. 54. The grains have deformed and the fracture was
transgranular. As shown in Fig. 29, p. 35, the fracture strain at 25°C
of heat 67-504 was lower than that of 67-502. However, the fractures
(Figs. 50 and 54) give the opposite impression,

Heat 67-504 also failed by a predominately transgranular mode when
tested at 650°C (Fig. 55). This observation_cofreletes quite well with
the high fracture strain of this sample;(Fig.”295 p. 35).

DiScuSSion of Results

The samples of standard Hastelloy N removed from the survelllance
fac111t1es inside the MSRE core and outside the reactor vessel continue
to show excellent compatibility with their respective enviromments of
fuel Salt_and N2 + 2 to 5% 02, We couid not detect the diffusion of fis-
sion products into the samples from the core. The sampies exposed to
the cell environment showed no eﬁidence of nitriding and only superficial
oxidation. ) o J

We have removed several groups of samples from the MSRE (Table 2, p, 6)
and some valuable observations have been made regarding the changes of
mechanical pfoPerties_with fluenee*and thermal expoeure. The thermal
flux in the center of the core is 40_timesrthat at the vessel wall. Only
the Hastelloy N thimbles for the control rods have been exposed to the
peak flux and have accumulated a'thermal neutron fluence of about
11X ;Ozl‘neutrons/em?. The tensile (Figs. 17 and 18, pp. 24 and'25) and
the creep (Figs. 21, 23, 25, and 27, pp. 27, 29, 31, and 32) properties
of Hastelloy N exposed to such a fluence are very poor; but the thimbles
are stressed only slightly'in compression and the observed property
changes are not catastrophic.

~ The peak vessel thermal fluence is presently (May 1968)
2.6 x 101° neutrons/em?, but the properties have already been altered
markedly, The results that we obtained at higher fluences can be used
to estimate the future properties of the MSEE vessel. Fiéure 56 has been
constructed for heat 5085 and shows how the fractﬁreusﬁréih at different
strain rates varies with thermal fluence at 650°C., The fraction of the
. strain remaining is based on the number shown in parenthesis Wthh is
the value measured in the unirradiated starting material after a 2-hr
anneal at 900°C. The corresponding curve for the burnup of 10p is also

with Thermal Fluence for Various Strain Rates.
65

shown for comparison (based on a cross section of 1930 barns for MSRE
spectrum’ ),

The strain rate of 300%/hr (0,05 min~!) is that normally used in
tensile tests and the vessel heats presently, after 72,400 Mwhr of oper-
ation, will strain about 20% at 650°C before failure. The fracture
strain decreases with decreasing strain rate to a minimum value of 1.5%
at a strain rate of about O.l%/hr. These property changes are gquite
large when we consider that only 4% of the 1B has been converted to
helium (accumulated thermal fluence =~ 2.6 x 1017 neutrons/cmz). However,
the results from samples exposed to higher fluences in the core indicate
that the property changes are not simply proportional to the quantity of
10B transmuted to helium. Although the intended operating time for the
MSRE has not been established, it likely will not exceed 362,000 Mwhr
(five times the energy already generated). Figure 56 indicates that the
mechanical properties should not worsen drastically from those that pre-
vail after 72,400 Mwhr of operation.

The main uncertainty associated with our estimate of the future
properties of the MSRE vessel is that we have not taken into account the
property changes due to thermal aging. As shown in Figs. 19 and 21,

Pp. 25 and 27, the tensile and creep properties of heat 5085 were changed
just by annealing at 650°C. However, heat 5065 (Fig. 25, p. 31) seemed
to be more resistant to aging. The noted changes in the fracture strain
at lower temperatures could also conceivably become a problem. These
changes also vary from heat to heat and depend on both fluence and aging
time. Thus, the effects of aging cannot be taken into account adequately
to improve on the property estimates made on the basis of Fig. 56.

The postirradiation properties of the two modified alloys (heats
67-502 and -504) were better than those of the standard alloys (compare
Figs 28 and 35, pp. 33 and 39). We cannot explain the property changes
that occurred as a result of aging these alloys in static barren salt,

but our current aging studies should reveal the mechanism.

Metallographic examination showed that the standard Hastelloy N was
very compatible with the fuel salt. The samples removed from outside
the vessel were oxidized but there was no evidence of nitrogen absorption.
The modified alloys were exposed to the fuel salt and an iron-rich layer
was formed on the surface, This transfer occurred because the modified
alloys contain less than 0.1% Fe and the standard Hastelloy N used in
the rest of the system contains 4 to 5% Fe.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have examined the third group of surveillance samples removed
from the MSRE. The materials involved were (1) standard Hastelloy N
exposed in the MSRE cell to an enviromment of N, + 2 to 5% O, for
20,789 hr at 650°C to a thermal fluence of 2.6 X 109 neutrons/bm2,

(2) standard Hastelloy N exposed in the MSRE core to fluoride salt for
15,289 hr at 650°C to a thermal fluence of 9.4 x 10°C neutrons/em®, and
(3) modified Hastelloy N exposed in the MSRE to fluoride salt for 9789 hr
at 650°C to a thermal fluence of 5,3 X 10°° neutrons/cm®. Postirradia-
tion creep and tensile tests were run to evaluate the influence of the
respective exposures on the mechanical properties. The property change
of most concern is the reduction in the fracture strain. The fracture
strain at 25°C was reduced by an amount related to both the neutron flu-
ence and the exposure time. The fracture strain could be restored by a
postirradiation anneal of & hr at 870°C and we propose that the reduction
in fracture strain at 25°C is due to carbide precipitation. The fracture
strain in tensile tests above 500°C and in creep tests at 650°C was
reduced by irradiation. This embrittlement is associated with the helium
that is produced by the transmutation of 10B in the alloy and cannot be
recovered by postirradiation annealing. We compared the results from
samples irradiated to thermal fluences ranging from 1.3 X 1019 to

9.4 x 1020 neu,trons/cm2 and have an approximate picture of how the frac-
ture strain varies with fluence. This picture is complicated by the fact
that the properties of the unirradiated material change some with aging
at 650°C, and we do not have sufficient data to separate the contribu-

tions of irradiation and aging to the observed embrittlement.
67

The modified alloys had better postirradiation properties than were
measured for the standard Hastelloy N. Although the properties of these
materials were affected appreciably by irradiation, the minimum fracture

strain observed in postirradiation creep tests at 650°C was 6%.
