VACUUM -DISTILIATION SYSTEM FOR REGENERATING FUEL AND
FERTILE STREAMS IN A MOLTEN SALT BREEDER REACTOR

C. D. Scott

ABSTRACT

The purpose of this study was to make a preliminary
design and an engineering evaluation of a conceptual plant
for treating the fuel and fertile streams of a molten-saltl
breeder reactor. The primary requirements of the process
are to recover the unburned fuel (233UFM) and fuel -stream
carrier salts (LiFéBng% from the fuel stream, and the
LiF -ThF), plus the bred 33U from the fertile stream. Both
streams must be sufficiently decontaminated for attractive
breeding performance of the reactor. The plant was designed
to operate continuously as an integral part of the reactor
system, Titting into two relatively small cells adjacent to
the reactor cell. In this study, the plant capacity is
based upon treating 15 ft3/day of fuel salt and 105 ft3/day
of fertile salt removed as side streams. These capacities
are adequate for a 1000-Mw (electrical) power reactor.

As to the fuel stream, bvasically it is purified by
fluorination and vacuum distillation. The first step
removes uranium as volatile UFg; the second recovers the
Li¥ -BeFo by simultaneously volatilizing these two compo -
nents from the less volatile fission products. Fortunately,
the fission products so separated are primarily the rare
earths, which are the most serious neutron poisons. The
UFg from the fluorinator is accompanied by some volatile
fission product fluorides, primarily those of Mo, Te, Ru,
Zr, and Nb, which are removed by sorption on granular NaF
and MgFo,. Finally, the UFg is reduced to UF) by hydrogen
and recombined with the decontaminated LiF -BeFp carrier in
a single operation. Fission products are removed from the
plant by discard of NaF and MgF, sorbents and the still
residue, which is a highly concentrated solution of the rare
earths in Li¥F. Wastes are permanently stored underground.

With respect to the fertile stream, the process consists
only of fluorination followed by decontamination of the UFg
on NaF and MgFo sorbents. It is only necessary to remove the
bred ©33U sufficiently fast to keep 2 low concentration in

the blanket, thereby ensuring a low fission rate and negligible
poisoning by fission products. Discard of the barren fertile
stream at a slow rate suffices to keep the fission product
concentration at a tolerable level.

The chief conclusions of this study are: (1) that the
Tluorination-distillation process for the fuel stream and the
fluorination process for the fertile stream comprise a compact
and relatively simple system that can be engineered with a
normal amount of developmental work, and (2) that integration
of the processing plant into the reactor facility is both
feasible and economical and the logical way to take advantage
of the processing possibilities of a fluid-fueled reactor.
The nominal cost of this plant is presented in the following
summary of major items:

Process equipment and building space $5, 302, 000

Fuel salt inventory 89, 500
Fertile salt inventory 69,200
NaK coolant inventory 40, 000
Direct operating cost 788, 000 /year

These costs contribute about 0.2 mill/kwhr to the fuel cycle
cost when the reactor operates at an 80% plant factor and

~ capital charges are amortized at 10%/year. This cost is

sufficiently low to add to the incentive for developing the

molten-salt breeder reactor.

Some of the steps of the evaluated process are based on
well -established technology, whereas others are based on
extrapolations of laboratory and small -scale engineering data.
- Fluoride volatility and assoclated UFg decontamination by
- sorption are well -known operations, having been demonstrated
~in a pilot plant. However, vacuum distillation and liquid-
phase reduction of UFg to UF) have been demonstrated only at
the bench. Certainly, more development of these steps is
required for a complete process demonstration. A singularly
serious problem is the corrosive nature of the fluorine-molten
salt mixture in the fluorinator. However, this study shows
that this and other inherent processing problems can be solved
by proper design and operation of equipment. |

INTRODUCTION

A reactor concept that has a high potential for economic production of
nuclear power and simultaneous breeding of fissile material on the thorium-
uranium fuel cycle is the molten-galt breeder reactor (MSBR). This reactor
utilizes two fluid streams. For this study, the stream compositions are:
(1) & fuel stream consisting of an LiF -BeF, (69-31 mole %) carrier that
contains the fissile component, and (2) a fertile stream, which surrounds
the fuel stream, consisting of a 71-29 mole % LiF -Th¥) mixture. In each
stream the lithium is about 99.995 at. % 7Lia The above compositions are

39

not unique; other MSEBR designs might use different compositions. The con-
figuration of the system allows a relatively high neutron leakage rate

from the fuel stream into the surrounding fertile stream, where capture

by thorium breeds additional 233U fuel. The reactor is operated at an
average temperature of about 650OC; fission energy is recovered in external
heat exchangers through which the fuel and fertile streams are circulated.
Sustained breeding performance of the MSER depends on the removal of
fission and corrosion products from the two fluid streams so that parasitic
neutron capture is kept to a tolerable rate. Portions of the two circu-
lating streams are continuously removed, processed for removal of fisslon
products, fortified with makeup Tissile and fertile materials, and returned
to the reactor in a cyclic operation.

A primary consideration of any process for recycling reactor fuel is
that minimal losses of all valuable fuel componente be attained without
intolerable capital investment cor operating expense. In the MSBR system,
this requirement applies to both fuel and carrier components. As mentioned

above, the fuel is 233U,

I

and one carrier component is the highly enriched
Ii isctope. The other major constituents, beryllium and thorium, are less
expensive; yet large losses of these cannot he tolerated either because of
the adverse effect on fuel ~-cycle cost and fuel conservation. The process
evaluated here accomplishes the obJjectives of conservation while providing
fission-product removal sufficient for a successful breeding system.
The work reported here is unique in that it examines a processing

plant integrated directly into the reactor system, which, in effect,

accomplishes on-stream processing. This method obviates the cumbersome
Lo

and expensive transfer of highly radiocactive material by carrier shipment;
furthermore, common use can be made of services and equipment necessary
to the reactor, thus avoiding the duplication that results in a separate
processing building. Also, since the spent fuel flows directly into the
processing plant, there is minimal out-of -pile inventory of valuable fuel
components.

Another interesting feature of this study is the use of the relatively
recent cdﬁéept of wvacuum distillation as a means of purifying the carrier
salt. A modest vacuum of only 1 to 2 mm Hg is required, but the tempera -
ture (about lOOOOC) is higher than any normally encounteréd in handling
molten fluoride salts. The operation was explored first by Kel]_ey3 in
laboratory exPefiments that indicated LiFéBeFe decontamination from
fission products by factors of 102 to 103. The attractiveness of the
process lies in the fact that it involves only a physical operation that
is easily controlled and that can be made continuous. Fission products
can be concentrated in the still residue (primarily 7LiF) by a factor of
about 250 by using the decay heat of the fission products to volatilize
LiF—BeFE. This high concentration factor ensures a low discard rate for
the valuable 7L:'L. Cyclic operation of the still was assumed, allowing
the fission product concentration to increase with time. The corresponding
increase in the rate of decay heat generation limited the cycle time to
about 68 days. Although limited experience with the distillation step
indicates that high-nickel alloys are satisfactory structural materials
for use at this relatively high operating temperature, a more extensive
investigation is needed to define the design limitations.

A novel idea has also been studied in the evaluation of liquid-phase
reduction Qf UF6 to UFA by hydrogen. Initial bench-scale experimentse6
have,given promising data. The reaction is carried out by absorbing UF6
in a molten mixture of LiF—BeFQ—UFA at about 600°C followed by contacting
with H2 to reduce UF6 in situ. This technique avoilds the troublesome
problem of remotely handling solids (small UFA particles) that would be
net if the customary gas-phase reduction of UF6 were used.

Aside from indicating the feasibility and economy of the process,
this study also uncovered important design and engineering problems

assoclated with the scaleup of laboratory and batchwise operations to

larger, continuous ones. In this regard, recommendations are presented
at the end of the text, along with important conclusions. The most note-
worthy recommendation is that the key operations, vacuum distillation and
continuous fluorination, be given high priority in development.

The material that follows is arranged in this sequence: TFirst, a
brief description of the MSBR system is given to put the study in per-
spective; second, design criteria and ground rules are stated for each
phase of the study; third, a process flowsheet and a description of each
unit operation is presented; fourth and fifth, a description and pertinent
design data for each major component and the processing cells are listed;
sixth, equipment and building-cost data are presented; seventh, an over-
all evaluvation of the process is given in a set of enumerated conclusions
and recommendations arranged according to plant characteristics and
process operations. Six Appendices, giving detailed data and calculations,

are attached.
THE MOLTEN-SALT BREEDER REACTOR SYSTEM

The processing system of this study is designed to meet the
requirements of the molten-salt breeder reactor shown in Fig. 1. This
is a conceptual designl of a power reactor capable of producing 1000 Mw
(electrical) with a thermal efficiency of 45%. Basically, it consists
of a graphite matrix enclosed in a cylindrical Hastelloy N vessel for
containment. GCraphite occupies about 79 vol % of the core, fuel salt
about 15 vol %, and fertile salt about 6. The flow passages are such
that the fuel and fertile streams do not mix. The core is surrounded
radially and axially by a 3.5-ft blanket of LiF-ThFM mixture, and the
blanket is in turn surrounded by a 6-in.-thick graphite reflector. The
core is about 8 ft in diameter and 17 ft high; overall, the reactor plus
breeder blanket is about 16 ft in diameter and 25 ft high.

Fission energy is recovered in a battery of external heat exchangers
through which the fuel and fertile streams are continuously circulated.
The coolant may be either a molten carbonate or fluoride salt mixture
which transports the heat to boilers for producing steam. ©OSmall side-

streams of fuel and fertile fluids are continucusly withdrawn from the

circulation loops and routed to a chemical processing cell adjacent to the
reactor cell. After being processed for fission product removal and
reconstituted with makeup materials, the two fluids are returned to the
reactor via the fuel-makeup system. The processing cycle is selected to
give the optimum combination of fuel-cycle cost and breeding gain.

The data presented in Table 1 are typical for the MSBR and were the
bases for this study.2 Since the reactor concept is undergoing engineer-
ing and physics evaluation, these data represent no fixed design and are

subject to change as the studies progress.
DESIGN CRITERTA

The following discussion delineates ground rules and arguments for
the particular choice of process and design used in this evaluation.
Choices were made on the basis of existing knowledge and data. The study
presented here is expected to verify basic assumptions or indicate

Jjudicious alternatives.
Basic Considerations

One basic consideration concerns the fuel yield (the fraction of
fissile inventory bred per year) which, for a breeder reactor, is inversely
proportional to the total inventory of the reactor and chemical plant
systems. This characteristic is essential to the design of an MSBR pro-
cessing plant and suggests close-coupling of the reactor and processing
plant to give minimal out-of -reactor inventory. A fluid-fueled system
is readily amenable to this type of operation, and for this evaluation
the processing plant is integrated with the reactor plant. This design
permits fast, continuous processing, restricted only by the rather
stringent design requirements for fission-product decay-heat removal and
corrosion resistance.

The integrated plant occupies cells adjacent to the reactor cell, and
all services available to the reactor are available to the chemical plant.
Thegse include mechanical equipment, compressed gases, heating and ventilat-

ing equipment, electricity, etc. The cost savings for an integrated

facility are immediately apparent when one considers the large amount of
equipment and facility duplication required for separate plants.

A further basic consideration is that there will be no large
extrapolation of technology in the process design. Accordingly, the
process is based on treating the molten salt by fluorination and distilla-
tion, with the supporting operations of UF6 sorption on and desorption
from beds of pelletized NaF, followed by reduction of the UF6 to UFM' A
large amount of dats is available for each step except for the distilla-
tion and reduction operations, both of which have been demonstrated in

the laboratory.3’26

However, this study does assume the necessary
engineering extrapolations to convert from the current batchwise operations

to continuous operations.
Process for the Fertile Strean

The two streams of the bfeeder reactor require different processing
rates and must be treated separately to prevent cross contamination. The
first step in process for the fertile stream consists only of continuous
fluorination, which removes the bred uranium as the volatile hexafluoride.
No other treatment is needed if this step is designed to maintain a low
uranium concentration. To accomplish this, the stream is required to go
through the processing plant on a relatively short cycle, for example,
once every 20 to 50 days. The cycle time for this study is 22 days. The
fission rate in the blanket is low, and the fission products are kept at
a tolerable level by periodic discard of barren LiF-ThFM salt. A 30-year
discard cycle suffices. 1In the second step, the volatilized UF6 is sorbed

on NaF beds, desorbed, and finally caught in cold traps.
Process for the Fuel Stream

The fuel stream of the reactor is processed by fluorination and
vacuum distillation to recover both uranium and carrier salt sufficiently
decontaminated of fission products. A cycle time of 40 to 7O days is
required to maintain the fission-product concentration at a low enough

level for attractive breeding performance. The calculations of this study
- 10 =~

are for a 58-day cycle. The UF6 is recovered by NaF sorption and cold
traps, Just as for the fertile stream. Decontaminated fuel and carrier
are recombined in a reduction step that converts UF6 to UFM and. further
purifies by reducing corrosion products (iron, nickel, chromium) to their
metallic states. Makeup fuel and carrier are added at this point, and
the stream is returned to the reactor.

The time that the fuel stream spends in the processing plant is kept

as short as practicable to minimize out-of -reactor inventory.
Waste Storage

The chemical plant provides its own storage system for process
wastes. Incidental wastes, such as slightly contaminated aqueous solutions
and flush salts, are assumed to be handled by the reactor waste system,
thus such facilities are not duplicated for the processing plant. OSeparate
storage is provided for fuel-and fertile-stream wastes, which are primarily
LiF plus fission products, and Li¥F -ThF,, respectively. The facilities are
designed for a 30-year capacity and afe located underground a short
distance from the chemical processing area.

The fuel -stream process also produces a less radiocactive waste than the
LiF~fission-product mixture. This waste is in the form of pellets of sodium
fluoride and magnesium fluoride pellets used for decontaminating uranium hexa -

fluoride. Interim storage of 5-year duration is provided for these solids.

Fission-product decay heat is removed either by forced air or natural

convection, as required by the heat load.
Operating Policy

Certain ground rules consistent with convenlent and safe operation
were adopted for this study. Maintenance operations are facilitated by
assigning unit-process steps to either a high- or a low-radiation level
cell. Operating and maintenance personnel, who are not required on a full -
time basis, are to be shared with reactor operation. No water or agueous
solutions are to be admitted to The process cells; fluids required for heat ‘I’

transport will be either air or sodium-potassium eutectic (NaK). A barren
- 11 -

fluoride salt, for example, an NaF -KF mixture, would be an acceptable

substitute.
Process Data

The primary concern of a processing cycle for short-cooled fluoride
mixtures is in dissipating fission product decay energy so that process
operations can be controlled. A maximum of about 6,5% of the total energy
of the system is associated with beta and gamma energy in the fission
products; this amounts to about 140 Mw (thermal) in the MSBR fuel stream.
Most of this energy i1s emitted quickly, decreasing about 82% in 1 hr and
95% in 1 day. The data for this study were calculated for the reactor
described in Table 1, using the PHOEBE Code, which computes gross fission -
product decay energy as a function of exposure and time after discharge
from the reactor. The data are presented graphically in Figs. 2a-b and
3a-b for fuel and fertile streams, respectively.

The graphs give an upper limit for heat generation because the
calculations do not account for possible intermittent reactor operation
attributable to the 80% plant factor. In addition, the graphs include
decay energy assoclated with gaseous products that are sparged in the
reactor circulating loop and with those fission products that might
depos;t on surfaces throughout the system. It is difficult to separate
this energy from gross energy until more is known about the behavior of
fission products in molten fluorides.

A process flowsheet showing material balances for the fuel and fertile

streams in the processing plant is included in Appendix F.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCESS

The processing facility must have the capability of removing the major
portion of fission products from the molten fuel salt and returning the
purified salt to the fuel system after necessary reconstitution with 233U
and carrier salts. As to blanket-salt processing, the facility must achieve
recovery of the major portion of the bred uranium for recycle to the fuel
‘stream or for sale. These goals can be met with present technology or with

processes that can be reasonably extrapolated from current technology.

In Fig. b4 it can be seen that fuel—stream proce851ng is achleved by

233

first removing the uranium (as UF ) and volatile fission products from
a side-stream of the molten salt by fluorlnatlon. Then the carrier salt
is vacuum-distilled frbm the residual fission products. Next, the UF6,
further purified by a sorption-desorption process based on the use of NaF
pellets, is dissolved in the carrier salt. TFinally, the UF6 is reduced
to UFA by hydrogen, thereby reconstituting the fuel salt.

Blanket salt is processed concurrently with the fuel salt by
fluorinating a side-stream. The UF6 gas 1is separated from the volatile
fission-product fluorides by sorption and desorption, using beds of NaF
pellets as mentioned above. The blanket salt needs no further purification,

233

and a portion of the UF6 is sent to the fuel stream by dissolving it in
the carrier salt and reducing it with hydrogen. The excess over that
needed to refuel the reactor is sold.

The two chemical reactions (fluorination and reduction) in the
process are simple, fast, and quantitative. The other interactions are
physical and require only heat and mass transport; however, in the case
of distillation, a rather high temperature (about lOOOoC) is involved.

The salt is extremely stable at any temperature anticipated in this
process, and other physical properties, primarily vapor pressure and

solubility for fission products, are in accord with process requirements.
Fluorination

As noted above, uranium and volatile fission products are removed
from both streams by fluorination. A batchwise, molten-salt fluoride -
volatility pfocess for recovering uranium has been under development for
several years. Currently the process is in the piloﬁ plant phase at
ORNL.lY’18 One of the steps in this process is batch fluorination of the
molten fluorides to remove uranium hexafluoride. As noted before, uranium
~in these streams is in the form of UFl¥ | This uranium and some»of the

.(Cathers_gz_§£:,20 Pltt,gl and Moncr1ef2 ) can be explained by assuming a
massatransfer—controlling rate mechanism due to inefficient mixing of the

protective layer of salt on the metal wall, and we adopted their approach
for this study. This frozen wall of salt, which is kept so by a high
cooling rate on the metal wall, prevents gross corrosion. Internal
heating keeps the rest of the salt molten. For the fuel stream, ficsion-
product heat is sufficient for this purpose, but for the blanket stream
it may be necessary to supplement decay heat by using suspended electrodes
for resistance heating. Since a maximum of 1.5 kw of heat per ftg of wall
area can be removed from such a system, the fuel stream will have to be
delayed in a cooling tank until the heat generation due to decay heat is
at a sufficiently low level. As to the blanket salt, decay heating will
be ingignificant.

The continuocus fluorinator is a tall column into which molten salt
is fed at the top and flows to the bottom; fluorine is introduced at the
bottom and passes to the top, accompanied by thé volatile fluorides (Fig.
An expanded deentrainment section is added to the top, and the body of the
column is Jacketed with a coolant to maintain the frozen salt wall. A
gravity leg is used in the molten salt outlet to hold a constant salt leve

in the column.
Purification of Uranium Hexafluoride by Sorption and Desorption

The UF6 from both streams is purified in the same way before being
returned to the fuel stream. OSince the UF6 that leaves the fluorinator
contains volatile fission products, it is purified by a series of sorption
steps. These are batch steps, but the process is made continuocus by
using parallel beds alternately.

The first separation occurs in a NaF absorption system where the gas
stream passes through fixed beds of NaF pellets. This system consists of
two distinct zones, one held at L00°C and one at about 100°C. In the
higher -temperature zone, corrosion products, entrained salt, and niobium
and zirconium are irreversibly removed from the fluorinator off-gas while
the UF, and other fission products pass through (Fig. 6). In the second
NaF zone (lOOOC), UF6 and some of the molybdenum are held up by sorption
while the remaining fission products pass through. At this point, the

UF6 has been separated from all the fission products except molybdenunm.

Two such systems are used, one for the fuel stream and

Molybdenum fluoride is removed from the UF6 by isolating the 100°¢ ‘
NeF zone, desorbing the UFg and molybdenum fluoride (by raising the
temperature to >lBOOC and passing fluorine through the bed), and passing
desorbed gas through a fixed bed of MgF,, which is held at about 150°¢C.

The MgF, sorbs the molybdenum but allows the purified UF, to pass through
into the cold traps.

The NaF pellets used in the high-temperature zone must be replenished
periodically since they accumulate fission products and corrosion products.
This discafd constitutes one of the waste streams. The two NéF sorption
zones may be integrated into a single unit, one zone on the other, and, as
Nal' is discharged from the lower zone, it can be replenished by Nal' from
the low-temperature zone, which is in turn fed with fresh NaF pellets.

Such a system has been used effectively in pilot plant operations, and a

similar system would be desirable for the MSBR processing facility.l7’18
In our concept, the system has a movable bed of NaF pellets, and, after

each sorption cycle, some of the lower NaF is mechanically ejected to

waste. Annular design with alr cooling would probably be necessary to

allow removal of fission product heat (Fig. 7).

As the UF6 leaves the last sorption trap it must be collected and
ultimately used as feed for the fuel -reconstitution step. This is done
by collecting the UF6 in cold traps. Two cold traps are connected in
series. The first, or primary trap, is operated at about -hOOC, and the
second, or backup trap, is operated at about -6OOC. The principal design
consideration is the heat transfer rate. Conventional designs are avail-
able for such units in which there are internal cooling fins for collecting
UFg, and Calrod heaters for vaporizing the UFg for removal (Fig. 8).
Uranium hexafluoride from the heated cold trap is fed directly to the
reduction process. This calls for at least three primary cold traps for
continuous operation: one for collecting UF6, one for feeding UF6, and.
one in transition between these two functions.

A fixed bed of NaF at ambient temperature very effectively removes
trace amounts of UF6 from gas streams. Such beds are used as backup UF6
traps in the fluorine exhaust from the cold traps and in other process
streams that might; contain UF6. Uranium is recovered from such traps by .

using the NaF as charge material for the main absorption beds.

Since there is excess fluorine in the fluorinator off-gas (33-1/3%
utilization), fluorine is recycled. This recycle contains some fission
products, so it is necessary to remove a side-stream (10%) Lo prevent
their buildup. Fresh fluorine is used for the desorption step, for all

processing in the blanket section, and for fluorine makeup.
Vacuum Distillation

The vacuum distillation step applies to the fuel stream only and is
used to separate the carrier salt from the fission products after the
uranium is removed by fluorination (see above ). The LiF and BeF2
volatilize, leaving fission products in the still bottoms. This residue
consists largely of rare-earth fluorides. If the relative volatilities
of the fission products, compared with the volatilities of LiF and Bng,
are low, then a good separation can be achieved in a single-step
distillation without rectification.

At the average operating temperature (sbout 650°C) of the MSBR itself,
the solubility of rare-earth fluorides in fuel salt is only a few mole
percent; however, at lOOOOC, the solubility in LiF alone is about 50 mole %

for the more insoluble compounds, for example, L&F3, Pr¥F_, and CeF Other

rare-earth (EE) fluorides have even higher solubilities 2t this teiperature.
Physics calculations on the 58-day-cycle MSBR indicate that at equilibrium
the molar ratio of L:L'F:(RE)F3 in the fuel is about 1400, a number consid-
erably greater than the 1:1 ratio permitted by the solubility limit at
1000°C. It is therefore apparent that, based on solubility data alone,
distillation at about 1OOOOC can tolerate an extremely large rare-earth
concentration factor before precipitation occurs. The design of the
distillation unit is concerned primarily with determining the appropriate
configuration that will permit a large fission-product concentration
factor and, at the same time, provide adequate heat-removal capability for
the short-cooled Tuel.

The still design developed for this study is shown in Fig. 9. It is
charged initially with L ft3 of Lil that has tThe same isotopic composition
as that in the reactor fuel; this volume Tills the tubes to a depth of

about an inch above their tops. The pressure above the LiF pool is reduced

to 1 o 2 mm of Hg by evacuating the product receiver (see Fig. D-3 in
Appendix D), and the temperature is adjusted and held at sbout 1000°C.
Fluorinated fuel salt 1s continuously admitted to the LiF pool in the
still, and distillation is allowed to proceed at the same rate as the
inlet fuel rate so that there is no net volume change.

The operating principle 1s to allow the rare-earth fission products,
which have a much lower vapor pressure than either LiF or BeFE, to con-
centrate in the still. The liguild pool in the still reaches an equilibrium

concentration in LiF and BeF and the Two components then distill at the

P
rate at which each is enteriig the still. The condenser is a conical
region located Jjust above the evaporating surface; it is kept at about
85000 by forced convectlion of heated air. Distillate 1s collected in a
circular trough and drained to a product receiver. The still is operated
in this way until the heat-generation rate due to fission-product decay
reaches the heat-removal capability of the NaK cooling system. This
point occurs after about 67 days of continuous operation, at which time
the fission product concentration in the still is about 1& mole ¢, a
value considerably less than the approximately 50 mole % solubility limit
at 1000°C. At this time, the contents of the still are drained to a
permanent waste receiver, and the cycle is repeated. These calculations
are conservative since they are based upon gross fission-product heat
release and do not subtract the effect of Tthose fission products removed
or deposited in the reactor before chemical processing.

The attractive feature of carrying out the distillation in this way
is that it minimizes the volume of expensive LiF relegated to waste.
Since distillation is carried out after fluorination, less than 0.1% of
the uranium removed from the reactor should enter the still, and at 1000°C
the vapor pressure of UFM is fTavorable to the recovery of a significant
portion of this fraction, reducing the overall uranium loss. Beryllium
fluoride losses should be insignificant because the vapor pressure of
Bell, ot 1000°C is about 100 times that of LiF. Distillation probably
will not effect decontamination from CsF and RbF; each of these com-
pounds has a greater vapor pressure than either BeFE or Li¥. Because
rare earths are concentrating in the still as a function of time, their

decontamination facltor in the product will decrease with time. It is not

possible with existing data Lo asgess the magnitude of this effect.
- 28 -

Detailed calculations for the still design are given in Appendices C
and D. Vapor pressure data for principal components of the fuel streanm
are included in Appendix F.

Distillate from the still is collected in an evacuated tank operating
at still pressure. When filled, the receiver is isolated from the still,

and the LiF -BeF, mixture is transferred by gravity flow or pressurization

to the reductioi and fuel -makeup operations.

An in-cell waste receiver is provided for the initial cooling of the
still residue before transfer tb the underground waste-storage facility.
The tank has a b-fto volume, allowing a one-cycle delay (about 67 days)
inside the cell where heat is conveniently removed by the circulating NaK
coolant. During this delay, the heat generation rate decreases from
3.2 % 10/ Btu/hr to 6.8 x 106, imposing less stringent design requirements
in the permanent waste recelver. The interim recelver is a shell-and-

tube type, similar Lo the still; hovever, no condensing surface or

provisions for air cooling are needed.
Reduction of Uranium Hexafluoride and Reconstitution of the Fuel

The combined UFé;streams,'that form the fuel sgalt and the Tertile
salt, are reduced to UFM’ and only a sufficient amoung3§o maintain
criticality is returned to the reactor. The excess U from the fertile
stream is sold. The usual method for this reduction has been by reaction
with the excess Hy in an HgéFg flanme:

(H2 + Fg) .
UF6 + H2 > UFu 4+ 2HF

This reduction is carried out in a btall column into which UF6 and H2 are

introduced into an HQAFE flame, and dry UFM powder is collected as the
product. However, according to our proposal, a more convenient method
for preparing UF) for the MSBR is by reducing the UFg to UF) with H,
ggzgz_the UF6 is dissoclved in the molten salt. There are some experimental
data indicating the feasibility of such a process; however, the kinetics

of the absorption and of the reduction must be further investigated.26 It

is possible that this two-step process could be carried out continuously
- 29 -

in a single column in which the molten salt flows upward, the UF6 is

introduced and dissolved in the bottom of the column, and the H2 is
introduced at an intermediate point to reduce the UF6 (Fig. 10). Some
of the reconstituted salt has to be recycled to the column to provide

enough dissolved uranium for proper UF6 gbsorption.
Off -Gas Processing

Most of the off-gas from the processing plant comes from the
continuous Tluorinators; smaller amounts are formed in various other
processing vessels. The gases are processed o prevent the release of
any contailned fission products to the atmosphere. Excess fluorine used
in the fluorinators is recycled through a surge chamber by a positive
displacement pump, and a small side-stream of the recycling fluorine is
sent through a caustic scrubber to prevent gross buildup of fission
products. Each of the processing vessels and holdup tanks have off -gas
lines which lead to the scrubber for removing HF, fluorine, and volatile
fission products.

The scrubber operates as a continuous, countercurrent, packed hed
with recirculating agqueocus KOH. A small side-stream of KOH solution is
sent to waste, and the scrubber off-gas is contacted with steam to
hydrolyze fission products such as tellurium. A filter removes the hydro-
lyzed products. The noncondensable Tission products are sent to the off-

gas facility for gases generated by the reactor.
Wagte Storage

Four waste streams requiring storage leave the processing facility:
(1) NaF and MgF, sorbent from the UFy purification system, (2) aqueous
waste from the KOH scrubber, (3) molten-salt residue from the distilla-
tion unit, and (4) molten salt from fertile stream discard. The aqueous
waste stream is small, and it is assumed that adequate capacity exists in
the system for storing reactor waste. The other three wastes are stored
in separate underground facilities adjacent to the procegssing cells.

and 33U -~ will be worth recovering at some future time, some very
tentative ideas about how they may be recovered are presented at the

end of this section.

Nal and MgF . Pellets

Spent NalF and MgF2 pellets, which retain the volatile fission and
corrosion product fluorides from the UF6 gas stream, are stored in 1lO-in. -
diam by 8-ft-high stainless steel cylinders in a concrete vault adjacent
to the still-residue waste tank. (See Dwg. No. 58080D in Appendix F.)

The cylinders are loaded inside the processing cell and transferred to the
underground area at approximately 90-day intervals. The vault is designed
to contain a 5-year collection of cylinders (160 cylinders at 100% plant
factor); after 5 years, the older cylinders are removed and transferred
to a permanent underground storage site. The integrated heat generation
when the vault contains 160 cylinders is about 1.73 x 106 Btu/hr. Forced
circulation of about 11,300 scfm of air at a temperature rise of 12500 is
used to remove this energy. The containers are constructed with a hollow
core, allowing coolant to pass through the cylinder as well as over the

outside.

Aqueous Waste from Off -Gas Scrubber

This waste, fission products in a strong sclutlon of KOH, will be
stored along with other aqueous wastes from the reactor system and
reprecsents an Insignificant contribution to the total amount of aqueous

wasgte.

Fuel -Stream Waste

Residue from the vacuum still is stored in bulk in a facility similar
to one evaluated previously by Carter and Ruch.lh A single, large tank
equipped with adeguate cooling tubes and adequate for a 30-year accumula -
tion of waste 1s provided. The 30-year capacity was chosen since that is
the expected lifetime of the reactor. After filling, the salt might
remain in the tank for additional decay or be disposed of by whatever

method is currently acceptable.
- 32 -

Decay heat is removed by forced air convection. The heat load (Btu/hr)
continually increases over the filling period but decreases rather sharply
when no further additions are made (Fig. E-1, Appendix E). The time
behavior of the integrated specific heat generation rate (Btu ™t fﬁ"3)
for a b-year collection period is shown in Fig. 11. This 1is a smoothed
curve for L-ft° additions every 67.4 days, followed by an extended decay
period during which no waste is added to the tank. The upper portion of
the curve might be extrapolated with little error to accommodate longer
filling periods. Filgure 11 shows the spedific heat generation for the
case of no dilution with inert salt; however, during the initial stages
of filling, it is necessary to add an inert diluent, for exampie, NaX' -KF
eutectic mixture, to lower the specific rate to a tolerable value. It
was calculated that 26k ft3 of diluent is required for the 520 ft3 of
LiF ~-fission product residue to be collected over the 30-year period. The
fission products being collected exhibit the decay behavior shown in
Fig. 2, which is repregsentative of gross fission products and does not

account for those that have been removed by processing or other mechanisms.

Fertile -Stream Waste

The fertile-stream discard is also stored in a large underground tank,
adequate for 30 years of waste collection. The tank is 13.5 ft in diameter
and 13.5 ft high. Since uranium is removed from the blanket on a rather
fast cycle, the fission rate in the blanket is low, making the waste
activity several orders of magnitude less than that of the fuel waste.
Cooling is provided by natural air convection around the tank and through
cooling tubes. All metal surfaces are expected to be coated with a layer
of frozen salt that will furnish excellent corrosion protection.

The integrated heat producfion rate due to fission products for the
30 ~year period is 5.9l x 3_0lL Btu/hr. Since this epergy is associated
with 1783 ft3 of LiFmThFu mixture, the moderate specific rate of 33.1 Btu

hrwl ft"3 presents no design problems. When first removed from the

1

reactor, the heat production rate of the waste is about 1600 Btu hr’ ft-3,

but this value decreases by a factor of 10 in about 4 days.

TIME AFTER DISCHARGE FROM REACTOR (days)

Fig. 11. Specific Heat Generation Rate of Fuel-Stream Fission Products
in Waste Tank. Waste is accumulated in 4 ft° batches every 67.4 days. It
is then held in the processing cell another 67.4 days for further cooling
before draining to the waste tank. The reactor operates on a 58-day cycle
at 2160 Mw (thermal).

Cooling System for the Waste

As mentioned above, the waste-storage system_is designed for cooling
by forced air draft. Air is easy to handle, COmpatible with construction
- materials for extremely long tlmes, and presents a minimum hazard 1n case.

~of contamination by the waste. Blowers, capable of supplylng 76 000 scfm
at a pressure drop of about 30 1n. water, are located upstream from the
waste vaults The alr is forced through the vaults and coollng tubes in
the Waste tank and 1is exhausted to the atmosphere via a. tall stack, which
also dlSposes of gases exhausted from the reactor system The ex1t duct
contains the necessary radlatlonamonltorlng 1nstruments and absolute '

fllters for remov1ng partlcles

significant uranium value would probably be.recévefed.by fluorination,
but the recovery of thorium and lithium requires:further process develop-
ment. A potential method for Li-Th separation is the.incompletely

15

investligated HF -dissolution process, based on_the:principle of leaching
LiF from THFA and rare-earth fissiqn products.with_ahhydrous hydrofluoric
acid. This process, however, leaves the thorium contaminated with fission
products, making it necessary to resort to an aquebus system (solvent
extractlon by the Thorex process) or to develop a thorlum recovery process
that utlllzes fluorlde chemlstry From & purely economlc v1ewp01nt,
thorium would be retalned in the waste tank until its recovery became more
economlcal than mznlng new thorxﬁm

On a 30-year dlscard cycle, an entire fertlile -stream lnventory of
: ThFh and LiF will aecumulate 1n the waste tank. In addltlon; the waste

will contaln "Pa, and flSSlon products in amounts that depend on
the breedlng ratlo, eff1c1ency of the fluorination step, and the ‘blanket
pOWer. The uranlum loss is based upon a. 90% efficiency in fluorlnatlon,

A value belleved to be conservatlve,_ The_largest loss of fissionable
- 35 -

material, however, is through protactinium, which we assume to be non-
volatile as the fluoride and which consequently is discarded in direct
ratioco to its concentration. The amount of fission producis is calculated
for a blanket power of 62 Mw (thermal) and an 80% plant factor; to account
for those fission products that have volatile fluorides or which are
plated out on parts of the system, a nominal figure of 80% is used for
the fraction that finally reaches the waste tank.  The 30-year inventory
of the waste tank is shown in Table 2.

Waste volume = 1783 ft3

In view of the figures in Table 2, the design presented here for the

fertile-stream waste system is not optimal. Nearly 99.5% of the 233U + 233Pa

value 1in the waste tank is attributbtable fo Pa discard; this loss can be

reduced to negligible proportions by providing in-cell decay storage

233
U.

. For example, a
decay to It probably would not be necessary to provide additional
fluorination eguipment for this volume because the refluorination could be

scheduled in existing equipment during reactor shutdown.
Flow Control of the Salt Streams
Flow control of the molten salt streams is by freeze valves coupled

with a controlled pressure drop. This can be achieved by the simple

freeze valve currently used in the MSRE (Molten Salt Reactor Experiment),
- 36 -

coupled with a flow restriction such as an orifice or venturi. A dynamic
freeze valve in which a controlled layer of salt is built up in a cooled
section of the line is bveing investigated; if successful, it will allow a

grester eage of flOW'control.ET
Removal of Decay Heat

Heat removal is a major problem in all process vessels that contain
short-cooled, highly irradiated fuel. In many cases, the heat flux and
operating temperature will be high, making it difficult to use water or
| air as primary coolants. Water has an additional disadvantage in that 1t
is incompatible with the process fluids, creating a hazard should there
be a leak in the salt lines. Therefore, a sodium-potassium eutectic
mixture, 22.3-77.7 wt % Na-K, was chosen as the primary coolant for
process vessels at temperatures above SOOOC where large amounts of decay
heat must be removed. This.codlant also has the capability of initially
heating the system to 600°¢ for startup purposes. Air was chosen as the

coolant for low heat fluxes at temperatures less Than 5OOQC.
Sampling the Salt and Off-Gas Streams

A rather complicated mechanism is required to remove analytical
samples from a highly radioactive molten-salt system. A technique similar
to that tested for the MSRE will be used,EB and the off-gas streams will

be sampled conventionally.
Shielding, Maintenance, and Repalr of Equipment

All process equipment that handles material that approaches the
radiation level in the reactor core will be shielded by about the same
amount of shielding as for the reactor, and maintenance will e indirect.
Process vessels in this area needing repair will be removed and sent to &
decontamination facility before repair. These include the fuel-stream
delay tanks, fluorinator, sorption-descorption systems, and distillation

system. All other equipment for processing radioactive materials is
- 37 -

contained in an area of direct maintenance with less shielding. In the
direct-maintenance area, decontamination for maintenance 1s achieved by

a molten-salt flush and an aqueous wash.
Materials of Construction

All process vessels and lines in contact with molten salt are made
of INOR-8 except the fluorinatocrs, which are made of a special material,
lloy 79-&.28 Vessels and lines'that contain Tluorine or fluoride -bearing
gases are made of Inconel or Monel, and cold traps are made of copper.

Other equipment is made of appropriately compatible material.
General Operating Policy

The overall policy for operating the [luorinator, vacuum still, NaF
beds, and related equipment is based on the projected simplicity of opera-
tion and small slze of the equipment. The system is designed for a
campalgn -type operation of one month's duration, without shutdown except
for emergency maintenance. There will be no access to the operating areas
during this period. At the end of the operating period, the entire systenm
will be closed down, routine maintenance accomplished, feed hoppers
replenished, accumulated waste transferred to waste storage, etc. The

operating cycle is then repeated.
PROCESS DESIGN

Process equipment for this design study was patterned as much as
possible after previously designed and tested equipment. Fach major
component was studied for its application to the continuous processing
requirements of the MSBR to ensure a practical design. Detailed designs
were made to the extent that overall size, configuration, heat transfer
requirements, flow rates, etec., were defined %o allow a reasonable
estimate of equipment cost. The waste system was considered separately,
and liberal use was made of a previous, similar :sﬁ:uéLyll‘L Tor its design

and cost dats.

PIANT DESIGN AND TLAYOUT

The inherent advantage of a fluid-fueled reactor is in close-coupling
the reactor and processing plants, thereby reducing capital investment,
inventory, and operating costs. This conceptual MSBR processing plant is
located in two cells adjacent to the reactor shield; one contains the high-
radiation-level operations, and the other contains the lower-radiation-
level operations. Each cell is designed Tor top access through a remov-
able biological shield having a thickness equivalent to 6 ft of high-
aensity concrete. Both cells are served by a crane used in common with
thé reactor_plant. Process equipment is located in the cell for remote _
removal and replacement from above. No access into the cells will be
'required; however, it is possible with proper decontamination to allow
1imited access into the lower-radiation-level cell. A general plan of
the processing plant and a partial view of the reactor system is shown
in Dwg. 58050D in Appendix F.
The highly radioactive cell contains only fuel -stream processing
equipmenﬁi:-fhe fluorinator, still, waste receiver, Nal and MgF2 sorbers,
and associated vessels. The other cell houses the blanket-processing ‘I'
equipment, fuel - and.fertile—stream cold traps, UF6 reduction equipment;

and fuel - and fertileéstream.makeup vegsels.

e
- 53 -

The high-radiation-~level cell has a cross section of about 19 by
22 ft; the less radioactive cell measures about 27 by 30 ft. FEach cell
is about LO £t high, the same as that of the adjoining reactor cell. A
"cold" operating area, located along the face of the cells, has dimensions
12 by 62 ft and contains the cold makeup equipment, product receivers, and
process-gas supply. All process operations are carried out remotely from

the reactor control roomn.
COST ESTIMATE

One of the major goals in this design study was to estimate the cost
of an integrated facility for processing the fuel and blanket salts for
this conceptual 1000-Mw (electrical) MSBR. The estimate arrived at
includes the total fixed capital cost and the annual operating cost
which are, respectively, $5,301,510 and $787,790 per year. In general,
conventional estimating practices were used except where past experience
in the nuclear energy field indicated changesu29”32

It is difficult to separate the process bullding and its eguipment
from the total reactor facility for cost-estimating purposes, since the
building must be an integral part of the reactor installation. To
determine the relationship between the costs of integrated processing
plant and the reactor bullding, it was assumed that the Molten Salt
Converter Reactor (MSCR) facility, designed by Sargent and Lundy
33

Engineers, represented the nonprocessing part of an MSBR. Any required
addition to the structure, facility, or operating cost of the MSCR due to
the addition of the processing facllity was considered a cost of the

processing facility.
Process Equipment

The installation charge for a component to be installed in an
indirect-maintenance area was set at 50% of the selling price and at 25%
for equipment to be installed in the direct-maintenance and cold areas.
A list of all major installed components and their costs is given in

Table 3. The total cost of the installation of major process equipment
is $853,730.

Several of the process vessels and auxiliary equipment are similar
to equipment previously purchased by ORNL or previously estimated in
another design reportBES These estimates were updated, and in some cases
conventional equipment sizes were extrapolated to meet the requirements
of this larger plant. The process vegsels in which high heat fluxes were
anticipated were considered to have costs comparable to that of the MSRE
drain-and-fill tank.

For Vessels and tanks of conventional design, the cost was computed
from the cost of material plus estimated charges for fabrication and
installation. A summary of the fabrication charges used is given in
Table 4.

Additional estimating criteria were:

Structure and Improvements

. Structure and improvements costs for the processing facility w

ere

~determined by assuming that these costs are directly related to corre-

sponding costs developed for the MSCR by Sargent and Lundy Engineers.

'Adﬂition of the procesgsing facility proposed here called for an additional

16.56% of floor space in the reactor building, and this factor was

to determine the cost from the corresponding MSCR data. The cost o

33

used

T the

crane and hoist was also increased by this amount. This additional space

includes a 10% increase in analytical and decontamination facilitie

The processing facility addition was 7.3% of the total building are

SB

a;

therefore, cost of the grounds and stack was increased by 7.3%. The

total increase in cost of structure and improvements due to the processing

~ facility was $550,770, which was obtained as follows:

Structure 0.1656 x $2,932, 400 = $485,610
Crane and hoist | 0.1656 x 195,000 = = 32,290

Other Plant Costs

Slgnificant cost items in the indirect-maintenance area of the plant
are the process line "Jjumpers", which have remote connectors necegsary
for indirect connection of pipelines, instrumentation lineg, and electrical

lines. The following cost schedule, based on experience at ORNL, was used

2
for estimating the cost of these connection8:3
Major pipelines $1,500/1ine
Multiple pipe and instrumentation lines $l,700/set
Electrical heater connection, including the
heater $2,000/set
Other process-piping cost schedules were:
Motor -operated control valves $500 each
Coolant air ducts $10/f%
MaJjor process lines in direct maintenance
area (<20 ft) $400 each
Gas lines in direct maintenance area (<20 ft) $200 each
NeK coolant lines (<20 ft) $800 each

The above cost schedule results in a total process-piping cost of $155,800.
The electrical auxiliaries consisted of the electrical substation,

- switching gear, feeders, and indirect connectors and Jjumpers. Cost

schedules used for these auxillaries were:29
Electrical substation and switching $36.60/kw
Overhead feeders $6.1/ft
Underground feeders $12.2/f%

The total cost of electrical auxiliaries is estimated to be $84, 300.
Process instrumentation is estimated to be $272,100, radiation
monitoring to be $100,000, and sampling connections to be $20,000.
The costs of service lines and high-temperature insulation are based

‘I' on the installed cost of the process equipment in the main processing
. 5 -

areas-and in the waste storége facility. The cost of service lines, taken
at 15% of the total installed cost of this equipment, amounts to $128,060;
the cost of the insulation, taken at 6% of this installed cost, amounts to
$51,220.

Total Fixed Capital Cost

The total direct plant costs are estimated to be $2,609,980 (Table 5).
Past experience was used to determine percentage costs of indirect capital

' items. These percentages are higher than those for other chemical indus -

tries but_re@resent actual cost expéerience in other ORNL projects.32

 Constructioﬁ overhead is estimated at 30% of total direct plant cost to
give a total construction cost of $3,392,970. Engineering and inspection
at 25% of total construction cost is $8L83,2L40, which results in a sub-
total plant cost of $h,2hi,216. Contingency at 25% of the subtotal plant

cost is $1,060,300, and the total construction cost is $5,301,510.

 Inventory costs include the cost of the molten salt held up in the

system and the initial cost of the NaK coolant. Total fuel-salt holdup

for this system is 63 3. At $1,Aeo/ft3, the charge is $89,460. Blanket-

salt holdup is 120 ft3, and at $56o/ft3 the cost is $67,200. TFuel- and

-~ blanket -salt charges do not include the cost of fissile material. The

400 £t holdup of NaX at $lOO/ft3 costs $40,000. The total inventory

cost is then $196,660, giving a total fixed capital cost of $5,L98,170.

Direct Operating Cost

The direct operating cost includes the cost of operators, chemical
consumption, waste containers, utilities, and maintenance materials. The
number of operating and support employees 1s based on a work schedule of
four shifts of LO hr each per week. These include immediate supervisory,
operating, maintenance, laboratofy, and health physics personnei, plus
two people.for routine clerical and janitorial work (Table 6).

No attempt was made to prorate the cost of higher supervisory,

clerical, or plant protectlon personnel for the procesgsing facility since

. some of this cost is included in labor overhead costs.

this includes fuel and fertile salt makeup.
Processing Cost

The processing cost per year is estimated at $1, 447,570 (Table 8).
This cost is obtained by combining the direct operating cost, the indirect
cost of labor overhead (80% of direct labor cost), the fixed cost due to
depreciation (10% of fixed capital per year), taxes (1% of fixed capital
per year), and insurance (1% of fixed capital per year). The percentage

range of usual practlce

On the basis of 300 days of operation per year for the 1000-Mw

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The central issues in this preliminary study were to analyze the
feasibility and cost of a conceptual system for continuously regenerating
the fuel and fertile streams in the Molten Sall Breeder Reactor. Briefly,
the system consists in (1) fluorinating, distilling, and reconstituting
the molten fluorides used in the reactor core, and (2) recovering the
233U from the molten breeder blanket by flucrination and using the
uranium to reconstitute the core salt. The excess is to be sold. ~ The
power of the breeder reactor was set at l,OOO Mw (electrlcal) for thls
study . | | | |

simplicity and low cost shown by this study.

In the conclusions and recommendations presented below, the

recommendations are underlined. The first Tour numbered paragraphs

relate to general characteristics of this fuel-processing plant, and

the others to specific unit operations.

FEASIBILITTY. Fluorination followed by distillation is a
feasible process for regenerating MSBR fuel (LiF-BeF,-UF)).
Fluorination alone is sufficient processing for the fertile

salt (LiF -ThF),). Reactor physics calculations indicate that
attractive breeding ratios can be obtained for such a process.
Engineering problems in the processing plant appear to be
amenable to solution through a well -planned developmental
program at the unit-operations level. Fluorination-distillation
should be developed as the processing method for the MSBR. Con-
currently, other attractive processes should be investigated at
the laboratory and/or engineering stage as potential alternatives.

INTEGRATED PLANT. Integrating processing and reactor facilities
is of primary importance in lowering the processing cost. Com-
plete advantage is thereby taken of the ready adaptability of a
fluid -fueled reactor for continuous processing with corresponding
minimum inventory. The relatively small size of this side-
strean processing plant, about 12 13 salt per day for a 1000 -Mw.
(electrical) reactor, is amenable to integrated construction,
thereby separating the economic dependence of the processing
industry upcn a large amount of installed electrical capacity.
The same {inancing convention that applies to the power plant
applies tTo the processing plant; this type of financing is
normally available at a lower rate than is available for a
separated processing facility.

ECONOMY. 'The estimated capital cost, excluding inventory, of
the plant is $5, 301,000, and operating costs are about $788, 000
a year. It is significant that the capital investment in the
integrated processing plant proposed here is only about W% of
the total cost of the reactor system it serves.

CORROSION. There are at least three areas in the chemical
processing plant in which corrosion behavior of construction
materials should be studied. These are the vacuum still, the
reduction unit, and filters. The still temperature of about
1000%C is much higher than has been contemplated for any other
part of the MSBR system, and the resistance of INOR-8 and
nickel to corrosive attack at this temperature is not known.
A reducer, hydrogen, enters the reduction unit and probably
helps limit corrosion there, but this should be verified.
Filters are subject to attack because of the large surface
area exposed to the fluid being filtered.

 FLUORINATION DEVELOPMENT. Batchwise Tluorimation of molten
- fluoride salts for uranium recovery has been rather thoroughly

investigated at ORNL; however, 1t is recommended that engineering
development of a continuous fluorinator be given high priority.
The need for continuous Tluorination is evidenced by the require-

~ment of low fuel and carrier ealt.inventories'in_the;proeessing"
plant. The reactor fuel system contains about 650 ft3 of salt,
and, without continuous  fluorination, the out-effplle inventory

could possibly be as large as the in-pile inventory. This
study indicates that in a continuous fluorination-distillation
process the holdup represents about lO% of the reactor Tuel

: volume. -

contlnuous Tluorinator be developed and demonstrated. ThlS
concept calls for a 1/2- to 3/%-in.-thick layer of frozen salt

- on.the 1n51de wall of the fluorinator to prevent the serious

Corr081ve attack by the molten mixture during fluorination.

_Ba81c information needed includes fluorination rate data, process

control in contbinuous operation, and method of establlshlng and

_malntalnlng & frozen wall.

Fluorlnatlon of the fertlle salt 1ntroduces probleme
81mllar to those encountered for, the fuel stream. However,
fertile-stream processing rates are 8 to 10 times higher, and

 the flSSlOprrOduct activity is several orders of magnitude

. less..  On the other hand, a lower fluorlnatlon eff1c1eney can

be tolerated in blanket processing.

Another method for continuous fluorination is the gas-
phase continuous operation in which Tluoride microspheres are
generated and fluorinated as they fall through a tower. This
process should be recognized as a potential alternative to the

- continuous method of fluorination studied here, but its

development should be subordxnate to that of the frozen-wall
concept

DISTITIATION DEVELOPMENT. The vacuum-distillation concept for
separating the LiF -BeFo (fuel-carrier salt) from fission products

~is feasible_from an engineering viewpoint. The theoretical net

discard of 'Li in the still waste is low epnough that its cost is
insignificant compared with other fuel cycle costs. Thermal

”7problems require that sufficient volume be malntalned for wetting
ca 1arge heat ‘transfer surface, and the bulldup of flSSlon products

in this volume will almost surely have an adverse effect on the
deeontamlnatlon factor of the distillate. Relative volatility
data are needed for the multlcomponent mlxture, LiF -BeFo ~figssion
products, in which compositions are in the range 99 5~O 50 mol %
to 84.5-0.5-15 mol % LiF ~BeFs-rare earth fluorides. It is |
strongly recommended that & conbinuous vacuum Sbill be built and

REDUCTION OF UF, TO UF,. This reaction is quantitative when UF6
is fed into an Fo flame contalning excess Hy, producing a
powdery EFM product. The solid product cakesg and adheres to
vessel walls, which should be avoided if possible in a remotely
operated system. The liquid-phase reactlion proposed here ig
more suitable for remote operation and should be developed. The
operating conditions that need study are: temperature, U, con-
centration, reaction rate, nozzle design, circulation rate,
contactor design, and gas-liquid separation.

The reducing conditions that exist in this operation are
consistent with those required for purging nickel, chromium, and

iron corrosion products from the fuel. Therefore the potentiality

of using the reduction unit for simultanecously giving the fuel a
final cleanup should be investigated.

SOLID -LIQUID SEPARATION. The general area of high-temperature,
solid-liguid separation in remote operations needs development.
Filtration techniques should surely be investigated to determine
operability and reliability in molten-fluoride systems.

FISSICN PRODUCT BEHAVIOR. A bpetter understanding of fission
product behavior throughout the processing plant is needed. In
particular, date are needed on the ways in which the variocus
nuclides partition in the several processing steps and on the
efficiency of removal. A more basic study is concerned with the
behavior of the fission products in the reactor environment to
determine whether or not certain nuclides remain in the reactor
system.

URANTUM HEXAFLUORIDE PURIFICATION. The NaF and MgFo sorption
units provide adequate decontamination for UFg. The batchwise
units can be operated satisfactorily for both fuel and fertile
streams of the MSBR; however, a coatinuous, temperature-zoned
system would reduce the frequency of cell entry. Probably the
largest uncertainties in UFg purification are in the removal of
tellurium and ruthenium; nmeans of removing them should be
developed.

The portion of the fertile stream used as fuel makeup need
not be passed through a sorption system because of the very
small amount of fission-product contamination. However, the
UF6 product that would eventually be handled by contact would
need purification.

PROTACTINIUM REMOVAL. The most significant advancement in
fertile-stream processing can be made in the development of a
process that removes protactinium. To be effective, the process
must remove protactiniue five to ten times as fast as its decay
rate; that 1s, the blanket volume would have to e processed
every four to eight days. Simplicity and ease of operation are
obvious requirements. Thus, a process based on forming protac-
tinium oxide by ilon exchange appears promising and should be

- 66 -

Effective removal would obviate the need of sending any
portion of the fertile stream to waste and possibly reduce
makeup cost to that represented by thorium burnup alone. Such
a process 18 not required for economic operation of the MSBR
since fluorination and fractional discard can adequately control
the fission product concentration; however, the potential
advantage of reduced waste cost and improved breeding performance
argues for basic development of a process.

12.  FUEL-STREAM WASTE SYSTEM. The most economical method of waste
mapnagement consists in bulk storage in a large heat exchanger
tank. The heat generation problem is so severe that the plant
waste must be diluted with an inexpensive, inert material, which
complicates future processing for reeoverg of any contained
values. The calculated loss of Ll and. U’in the fluorination-
distillation process is small, being only 1.5 to 2% of the fuel-
cycle cost.

The possible use of fission-product decay heat should not
be overlooked in the evalustion of an MSBR. The accumulated
waste generates about 4.5 Mw (thermal) throughout most of the
filling period of the waste tank. Thus salt-storage tempersture

“can be maintained high enough to make the waste tank a source of
high -temperature energy.

13.  FERTILE -STREAM WASTE SYSTEM. The fertile-stream waste contains
a significant inventory of valuable materials whose recovery is
probably warranted. At the end of the 30-year filling period,
the waste tank contains about 141,000 kg of Th, 10,400 kg of
114, and 116 kg of 233U; the “33U is isotopically pure material,
having been formed almost entirely out of the Tission zone.
Although not considered in this study, an in-cell decay period
of about six months followed by refluorlnatlon appears to be
advisable for greatly reducing the amount of “33Pa that enters
the waste tank.

14. PROCESS CONTROL. This aspect of plant operation was given only
a cursory review in this study, and no areas of unusual control
difficulty were observed. A flow-control device for the molten-
salt stream is needed, and the dynamic freeze-valve conceph
should be developed. Analytical and sampling regquirements
require a more thorough study than was given here. :

APPENDIX A. DESIGN CALCULATIONS FOR FUEL
SALT FLUORINATOR AND COOLING TANK

The unit operation of fluorinstion requires temperature contrcl at
about 55000 for the salt being fluorinated. The fact that this salt is
highly radicactive introduces a problem because 1t is necesgsary to extract
this decay heat through the walls of a flucorinator whose size is fixed by
other process requirements, such as throughput and residence time. If
there is insufficient heat transfer surface available for thlis purpose,
then the salt must be allowed to "cool" bvefore entering the fluorinator.
The solution to this problem is to insert a cooling tank immediately
upstream of the luorinator.

The following calculations pertain to the thermal design and size of
the fuel -salt fluorinator and the size of the cooling tank. It was
determined that the maximum permissible heat fiux for the fluorinator is
5.31 x J_olL Btu hr ftf3 and that the size is L.75 in. in diameter by
10.3 £t high. The cooling tank reguires a volume of 22.5 ftg, A Turther
result of this calculation is a graph of heatl generation rate at the
cooling tank exit as a function of elapsed time since discharge from the
reactor.

- The fluorinator design criteria are:

Fuel -salt flow rate 15 £ /aay
Uranium rate T7.3 g-moles/day
Fluorine utilization 33-1/3%
Maximum mass flow rate of gas 0.277 slpm/in.
Maximum heat flux through the frozen wall 1.5 kw/f{
Heat of reaction (UF) + Fp = UFg) -162 kcal/g-mole
Residence time of salt 2 hr
The Fg flow rate through the column is:
F=77.-3x 3= 231.9 g-moles,
= L.83 slpm .
Fluorinator cross-sectional area is:
.83 .2
A = 57T - i7.5 in.  ,

D =/ .__?_‘-':%_Til;'é_: 4. 75 in.

The surge tank must have sufficient capacity to allow the fuel salt to

to be well -mixed, and assuming that the heat generation rate of the salt

cool to a heat rate of 5.15 x lOLP Btu hr

can be expressed as an exponential function of time, then,Bu

surge tank can be expressed as:

The data on heat generation rate with respect to time elapsed since
the salt has been removed from the reactor can be expressed as a series of
equations of the form of Eq. (A-l). B8ix intervals were chosen from the
data in Figs. 2a and b (see text). In each time interval, the constants
of the exponential equation approximation were determined by coupling the
equation at the two ends of the time interval. This resulted in a repre-
sentation of the heat generation data, which was always equal to or some-
what greater than the calculated heat generation rate. The values of the

constants in the approximate equations are:

Interlm-Storage of Waste

FlSSlon products, which are volatlllzed in the fluorlnator, accumulate

B in the movable4bed sorbers and create a heat source that must be considered

in the de81gn of these units. Excess heat must be removed so that it does
not 1nterfere with control of bed temperature Actual removal of the heat
1S:not_the problem_here.slnce_Sorbers,:whleh_accomplish this end, have been
designed_and used in the ORNL Velatiliﬁy Pilot Plant. :

p_. The essential problem is to estimate the heat generation rate due to
radioactive decay of the fission pro&uets present in the system prejected_
here. This was done by first assuming that half the fissionwprOQUCtﬁheet__
generating capacity which reached the fluorinator would exit to the sorber.
Further, all the fission-product heat is concentrated in the lower zone in
the sorber, and it was removed in the NaF waste stream. As noted before,
one -fifth of the lower zone is exhausted per day, and there are two parallel
sorbers alternately operating for 12 hr each. This results in an accumula -
tion of decaying fission products or of decreasing heat sources in the
sorber, in the NaF waste tanks, and finally in the interim waste-storage’
Tacility. i

| The heat generation rate for various process components was approximated

by determlnlng the average heat generatlon rate during a specific time
perlod and by assumlng that this rate decayed as the total flSSlonmproduct
‘heat rate decayed as shown in Figs. 2a and b. The accumulated heat
generatlon rate could then be expressed as a rate characterlstle of tfission
-f*produets having an -average age_lntermedlate_between phe_oldest and the

'moet_reeently sorbed.
- 79 -
Movable -Bed Sorber

In the movable-bed sorber, the heat load can be approximated by
assuming that the volatile fission products from the fluorinator accumulate
for 5 days and that those first accumulated will decay or cool as additional
accumulation occurs. A table can be prepared for accumulated heat genera -
tion rate, derived from the residence time of fission products in the

sorber:

Sodium Fluoride Wagte Containers

The Nal' waste tanks accumulate NaF and fission products from the
sorbers. FEach tank holds two complete bottom sorber zones from each of
two sorbers {10 days' accumulation of fission producte in one-day incre -
ments ). These zones exhaust to the NaF waste tank each day for 10 days.
According to the slope of the fission-product decay heat curve (Figs. 2a
and b), the average residence time of the fission products, and the average
heat generation rate of the Na¥ bed material as it leaves the sorber, the
following heat generation rate exists in the NaF waste tank at the end of
10 days, at which time it is full.

Short-Term Cocoling Station for Waste Sodium Fluoride

The NaF waste containers are to be cooled for 80 days, within the
processing area. This calls for a cooling station with the capablility of
cooling eight NaF waste containers whose average age varies from about

7 days to 87 days. The following heat generation rates apply to the cooling

station:

Interim-Storage of Waste

As mentioned above, the waste containers are to be cooled for a
minimum of 80 days by forced air convection prior to their transfer to
the interim waste-storage facility. The average heat generation rate of
one container at the end of this time (based on the slope of the fission-
product decay heat for this period) will be 104,000 Btu/hr.

An average of 28 containers are to be sent to this waste-storage
facility per year at one-month intervals — an average of 2.33 containers
per month. When the cell 1s opened for transfer, the most recently
filled container has 80-day-old material in it, whereas, the first filled
is about 110 days cld. On the average, the heat generating rate of the
transferred containers is characteristic of one that is 95 days old whose
rate is 87,500 Btu/hrg The average heat generation rate of containers sent
to the interim storage facility is:

2.33 x 87,500 = 203,900 Btu/hr .

The heat generation rate of these containers decays with storage

time, and the average rate in the interim facility for one year's

acceunulation is:

APPENDIX C. ESTIMATION OF DISTILIATION
RATE IN VACUUM STILL

Here, calculations are given whereby the distillation rate of the
vacuum still is estimated. The configuration of the still is shown in
Fig. 9 of the text. The calculational method used is a modification of
the procedure for calculating the rate in molecular distillation as given
by Burrows.l6 For our étill, it is estimated that at lOOOOC and at a
pressure of 1 mm of Hg, the distillation rates for LiF and BeF
3 and 2.02 x 107 2,

For molecular distillation, a still is designed so that its condensing

o 2T,

respectively, 3.32 x 10~ g Sec"l cm
surface 1s located quite close to its evaporating surface, thereby
minimizing the transport distance for the vapor. I the separation
distance is small enough and 1f the pressure i1s low enough, a molecule
leaving the liguid surface has a very high probability of reaching the
condenser without ccolliding with another molecule. This is the essence
of molecular distillation. Our still cannot be described precisely as a
molecular still because 1ts operating pressure is too high; however, the
pressure is low enough that conditions for molecular distillation are
approached. TFor this reason, the calculational methods of molecular
distillation, modified to apply to pressures slightly higher than those
for true molecular distillation, are used here to estimate the distillation
rate for our still.

The theoretical rate of distillation of a single substance for such
conditions can be derived from the kinetic theory of gases, shown by Burrows
to be;

-2 -1 -2
5.83 x 10 P ,M?T g sec  cm (Cc-1)

where pmm is the equilibrium vapor pressure in mm of Hg, M is the molecular
welght in grams, and T is the absolute temperature in °K. The resulting
distillation rate is expressed as g sec™ cm ™.

The actual rate of distillation at low pressure will be less than the
theoretical rate because there will be collisions in the vapor space.
Burrows develcoped an expression for the factor by which the theoretical

distillation rate should be multiplied to get the actual rate. Summarizing,
-"8_4'-'

his treatment considers three events that can occur to the moleeule in the

vapor space:

Wtdy :

1. Some molecules can reaeh the condenser without a collision; this
fraction is e4K, where K 1s a dimensionless .factor depending upon
the distance between evaporator and condenser, the equilibrium .
mean free path of the molecules, and the shape of the evaporating
suriace. _ ' . T

2. The fraction of molecules that collide is (1 - e ™ }, and the % XK

o fraction of these molecules that reach the condenser is (l -e e
approx1mately ' '

3. From purely geometrical considerations, the probablllty of a
molecule's striking the condenser after many collisions, which
result in random motion, is a factor ¥, the ratio of condenser
area to condenser area plus evaporator area. The Tfraction of
these molecules that reach the condenser after meny colllslons
is F(1 - eX)(1 - eX). -

The total fraction L of wvaporized molecules that reach the condenser

- is given by the sum of the three fractions above:
f=e™ 4 (1 - e—K)e—K + F(1 - e—K)(l - e_K) ,
=7 o+ (1 - 1) (e Ty |

When the theoretical rate is multiplied by f, defined to be the
evaporation coefficient, the rate of distillation for a single component
becomes :

The evaporation coefficient I is not readily calculated because of

the difficulty in determining the proper value of K, which is defined to
be:

However, as K increases, the value of f approaches the value of F, a number
that is known from the configuration of the still. For the still shown in
Fig. 9 (see text), F >~ 0.58. An estimate of the size of K for this still

can be obtained for the two values of k given above and from the fact that

and for this still, d ¥ 10 cm. Using these values, one finds that

K= 12.1 for k = 30 ,

and
K= 103.7 for k = 3.5 .
In either case, K is sufficiently large that Eq. (C-2) reduces to
f~FZ0.58.

In processing the fuel stream of the MSER, distillation must treat a
multicomponent mixture of LiFéBeFE-UFu—fission products. However, LiF and
BeF2 constitute more than 99 mole % of the mixture, as shown in Table C-1,
making it possible to treat the mixture as a binsry solution for purposes
of calculating the distillation rate.

Burrows has shown that for a binary mixture, Eq. (C-3), which gives

the distillation rate, becomes:

APPENDIX D. FISSION-PRODUCT ACCUMULATION AND HEAT GENERATION
RATE IN LITHIUM FLUORIDE POOL IN VACUUM STILL

Nonvolatile fission products accumulate in the vacuum still as the
LiF--BeF2 fuel carrier and velatile fission products are distilled away.
The still is initially charged with 4 Tt° of makeup 'LiF, evacuated to &
pressure of 1 mm Hg or less and adjusted to a temperature of about lOOOOC.
Fluorinated fuel salt, contalning fission products, is allowed to flow
continuously into the pool of LiF, and the still is operated so that the
rate of distillation is exactly equal to the feed rate. There is no bottom
discharge, and the volume remains constant. Kelly's work25 showed that the
initial Li¥F and BeF2

1000 from rare earths. Operation 1s continued at the above pressure and

distillate is decontaminated by a factor of 100 to

temperature until one of two phenomena forces termination: (1) Either the

3

solubility of fission products in the 4 ft” of LiF is exceeded and trouble-
some precipitation occurs, or (2) the accumulated heat generation rate from
fission=-product decay begins to tax the capacity of the cooling system.
When the distillation is terminated, the LiF~fission-product residue in the
still is drained to a waste receiver and eventually to permanent storage.
The operating cycle is then repeated.

The aim of the following calculations is to determine the operating
cycle for the still and the limiting conditions for the design shown in
Fig. 9. Since one design criterion is to process the fuel stream with
minimum out-of -reactor holdup, and since the solubility of the rare earths
in LiF at 1000°C is about 50 mole %, it is apparent that condition (2)
above will be controlling. Decay-heat removal will be a serious problem
long before solubility limits are approached. It has been determined that
the h»ft3 still can operate continuously for about 6T.h days at a distilla-
tion rate of 15 fts/day, processing fuel that has the heat generation
characteristics shown in Figs. 2a and b of the texi. The significance of
this number is that it represents the rate of 7Li discard to waste - 116 kg
every 67.4% days. The heat generation rate at this time is 31 x 106 Btu/nr,
the maximum that can be removed by the cooling system.

The calculations below are believed to give a conservative estimate

of the still performance. The basic data on fission-product heat generation
- 90 -

versus decay time represent gross values and hence do not exclude the
contributions of those fission products removed by the reacltor gas sparge,
by deposition on metal surfaces in the reactor system, or by the fluorina-
tion step in chemical processing. Furthermore, the 15-ft3/day design rate
is probably excessive for a 1000 -Mw (electrical) MSER; the economic optimum
rate is perhaps nearer 12 ft3/day. Also, no credit was taken for periodic
interruptions in processing due to the reactor's operating at less than
lOO% planﬁ'faétor. All these factors tended to shorten the still operating
cyéle and increase the discard cost. |

The calculations are arranged as follows: TFirst, an analytical
expression is derived for the heat generation rate of fission products
in the still as a function of elapsed time since discharge from the

reactor. Second, this equation 1s then used to evaluate the still design.
Analytical Expression for Heatl Generation Rate

When irradiated fuel salt is discharged from the fluorinator, it has
been out of the reactor about 38 hr. A cooling tank downstream from the
fluorinator adds another 24 hr of holdup, so that the salt is about 62 hr
old when it reaches the still. The heat generation characteristics of
the salt durling this periocd were calculated by assuming an infinitely
mixed system; these calculations are described in Appendix A, and the
results are shown graphically in Fig. A-1. Continuous operation is
assumed. throughout the system, and, by the time the fuel reaches the
still, its heat generation (Fig. A-1) is aboub 4.45 x 10° Btu hr~t ££73.

The still is a sink for fission products that exhibit decay behavior
like that shown in Fig. 2a and b. Initially at t = 62 hr = 2.58 days,
the 4 £t of LiF in the still is fresh material having a zero heat genera-
tion rate, but this condition changes rapidly when the still is put on-

stream. Flow into the still is continuous, and the rate of healt generation
 Wil1 rise until flow is stopped. The magnitude of thié rate at any future
time T is therefore an integrated quantity over the accumulation period:
to'z 2.58 days to T. To describe the behavior of the still during this

~period, define the quantities

The limits of integration extend from to = 2.58 days to t = T days, where
T denotes the time after discharge from the reactor at which the heat
generation rate is desired.

To treat BEg. (D-3) analytically, the function q(t) is obtained from
Figs. 2a and b by representing the curve on this graph by four straight-
line segments in the range 2 to 400 days. The procedure is diagrammed in

Evaluation of Vacuum-Still Design

Two principal conditions had to be satisfied in the still design:
(1) the evaporating surface had to be sufficient for obtaining the required
15—ft3/day distillation rate, and (2) maximum heat transfer surface had to
be provided to minimize the frequency with which the still is drained to
the waste tank. The choice of dimensions was somewhat arbitrary; a tube-
sheet diameter of 2.5 ft was chosen because 1t gave an evaporating surface
that was about 2.5 times the calculated areca, and a closely spaced arrange=-
ment of 2.5-ft-long by l/2-in.udiam tubes was used for high cooling-surface-
to-volume ratio. The primary unknown operating condition is the length of
time that fission products can be accumulated before the integrated heat
generation taxes the capacity of the cooling system; an estimate of this
time is determined in the following calculations. The schematic diagram
in Fig. D-3 depicts the still operation and summarizes calculated performance
and physical data.

The calculations which are described %below indicate that the still
can accumulate fission products for about 67.4 days in a h—ft3 LiF pool
when the gtill 1s operated continuously at & feed rate of 15 ft3/day. The
discard rate for LiF is therefore a very small fraction of the processing
rate, being about O.h%. As mentioned above, the heat generation rate
predicted by Eq. (D-8) is probably excessive because gross instead of net
fission-product data were used; therefore this accumulation time can be

treasted as & lower limit.

Physical Data for Still

Applicable data are given on Fig. D-3.

Heat Transfer Characteristics

The 1000°C temperature of the IiF pool in the still was chosen to
achieve adequate distillation rate and fission-product solubility. The
pool transfers heat to the tube walls by natural convection, and this heat
is picked up on the outside of the tubes by NaK (22.3-77.7 mole % Na-K

eutectic) under forced convection. The NaK coolant enters the still at

of 340°C (612°F). Heat transfer characteristics of LiF were calculated by
using the Nusselt eguation for natural convection, in conjunction with the
physical-property data given in Appendix F. A Nusselt-type equation for
flow normal to banks of tubes was used for calculating the heat transfer
properties of the coolant. Since the total heat dissipation requirement
of the still was unknown (because fission-product accumulation time was
not known), the coolant heat transfer coefficient was expressed as a
function of the heat generation rate. It was determined that the still
could dissipate about 31 x 106 Btu/hr for the NaK flow conditions shown

in Fig. D=3. The overall heat transfer coefficient.for maximum heat flux
is about 190 Btu hr ™~ ££™= °%F L. From Fig. D-2, the time after discharge
from the reactor corresponding to the above integrated heal generation is
70 days. The fission-product accumulation time is 2.58 days less or 67.4

days because of the time lag before fuel reaches the distillation step.

Li¥F, BeF,, UF,, and Fission-Product Discard Rates. — At the end of

the 67.4-day cycle, the still contents are primarily LiF and fission
products. The equilibrium BeF2 concentration was estimated above to be
only 0.4 mole % because of its relatively high vapor pressure atl 1000°C.
If it is assumed that the fluorination step is 99.7% efficient for uranium
removal, then in 67.4 days about 3.64 kg of U will have entered the still.
Uranium tetrafluoride has a vapor pressure at 1000°C about 2.3 times that
of LiF, so a portion of the UF)Jr will be recovered in the distillate. The
amount recovered cannot be calculated until more is known about the vapor-
liguid edquilibria of multicomponent melten salt mixtures. Filssion-product
accumulation during this period is aspproximstely 190.1 kg; most of the RbF
and CsF of this inventory will distill becsuse of relatively high vapor
pressures. *

An estimate of the inventory relegated to waste every 67.4 days is
given in Teble D-1. A reactor plant-factor of 100% was assumed in the
calculation. These values are based on ideal-solution behavior, particularly
with regard to LiF and BeFE; this is almost surely not the case for this
mixture. As more is learned about the activities of the components, it can
be expécted that the compositions of Table D-1 will be different from those

shown.

Separate storage is provided for fuel and fertile stream wastes as
fTluorides in underground tanks designed for bulk accumulation over a 30-
year period. Waste management in the post-~-30-year period was not con-
sidered in this study. However, as mentioned in the text (see Table 2),
it will probably be desirable to reprocess the fertile-stream waste, which
is only mildly radiocactive, at some future time for recovery of thorium,

233

lithium, and uranium values. About 116 kg of U will be present. Fission
products, separated in this recovery, could be stored longer, depending on
the activity.

- In the fuel-stream waste, the only significant value, other than the
possible future value of individual fission products, is 7Li. However, as
explained below, it is necessary to add a mixture of NaF -KF to this waste
to facillitate heat transfer. Since these compounds are chemically similar
to LiF, recovery of the lithium is difficult. In any event, at the end of
the 30-year period, the desirability of recovery would have to be analyzed
in light of the prevailling costs.

Two basic problems must be solved in designing the waste storage
system: (1) the integrated rate of heat generation by fission ~-product
decay must be determined, and (2), using the results of (1), the most
economlc deslgn for the prevailing conditions must be found. The heat
generation rate is computed Trom the fission-product decay behavior
exhibited in Figs. 2a and b (see text), and the results are shown in
Figs. E-1L and E~-2. A previous study by Carter and Ruc:hll!L examined a
similar waste-storage problem, and, in accord with their recommendation
for economic waste management, bulk storage in large, heat-exchanger tanks
is adopted for our wastes. Conceptual designs of the waste facilities are
shown on Dwgs. 58080 D and 58081 ¢ in Appendix F.

Over the 30-year period, 784 £

the processing cell, plus 284 ft3 of NaF -KF' diluent. The storage tank is

137.4 days; at this time the heat generation rate of the h-rt3 batch is

6.8 x 106 Btu/hr. The curves of Fig. E-L are plotted to show the thermal
history of the underground waste tank over a 5-year collection period
during which 27 batches are added; alsc the decay in the post-b-year
collection period is shown. The curve with positive slope represents the
buildup of heat generation rate from all batches accumulated up to the
indicated time. This curve is actually a stepped curve, but for convenience
it has been drawn smooth through the maximum point of each step. The waste
tank is designed for 30 years' collection, and the accumulated heat genera -
tion at this time can be obtained with little error by extrapolating the
positive-sloped curve of Fig. E-l.

Figure E-2 has been included to show the integrated heat generation
rate in the underground waste tank when the still residue is drained into
the tank immediately upon completion of the distillation cycle.

Figures E-1 and E-2 represent an upper limit for fission-product heat
generation. As pointed out earlier in this report, the values are for
gross fission-product decay, which includes nuclides that have been removed
prior to wvacuum distillation. Also the curves were calculated for a

reactor plant factor of 100%.

Basic Features of Tank Design

A previous studylLL showed that bulk storage in large tanks is the most
economical management for fluoride wastes. A 30-year periocd was chosen
because it coincided with the amortization pericd of the reactor plant, and
g single tank is sufficient because the overall waste volume is small. For
economy and reliability, cooling by forced air draft was adopted, and an
upper limit of 60 fi/sec was assigned to the velocity. Waste temperature

in the tank is not to exceed 750°C.

Meximum Allowable Heat Generation Rate

Under the above ground rules it is apparent that there is an upper
limit that can be tolerated for the volumetric heat production rate, and
that the waste will have to be diluted to wet sufficient cooling surface.

In 30 years at 80% reactor plant factor there will be 520 ft3 of radiocactive

When the still bottoms are drained directly to

Volume of Diluent

The total volume of fluid in the waste tank at any time is the summation
of individual batch volumes from the process plus the required diluent.

Expressed mathematically,

N
v(t) = % (h+7V )
n=1
where Vdn ig the reguired diluent volume for the nth batch, and the summation

is carried out over N batches. The above paragraph shows that the total

volume at any time is the quotient of':

integrated heat generation rate (Btu/hr)

allowable volumetric heat generation (Btu nr ft—S)

a(t)
= I
5.75 x 10

The required diluent volume for each batch can now be determined by solving

alt) - 3 (h+v, ) .
5.75 x 10 n=1
The value of q(t) corresponding to the nth batch is read from Fig. E-1.
It is apparent that the largest diluent volume is required when the
first batch is drained to the waste tank. Eventually the tank contains
sufficient volume so that no further inert diluent is required. This
behavior is shown on Fig. E-3. The total volume of diluent is 264 ft3,
meking the 30-year volume of waste plus diluent equal to 78L fts. In
actual practice, the total diluent volume would probably be added at the
beginning of waste collection rather than in discrete steps, as shown in

the figure.

Waste Tank Design

The 937 U-tubes are installed in the tank with one end open to the
interior of the vault, and the other end welded into an exhaust duct
leading to the stack. Air forced into the vault passes over the outside
of the tank before entering the U~tubes. This design provides about

6100 ft2 of tube cocoling surface, which is about 2.5 times the calculated

requirement. The relatively large number of tubes and the small waste
volume lead to a tank that has a low height ~to-diameter ratio. The tank
is 16 £t in diameter and 6.33 ft high and has a storage volume of about

86O(ft3. Monel was chosen asg the structural material.

Underground Storage Facility

The underground storage area is shown on Drawing 58080-D, Appendix F.
In addition to the vault for the fuel -stream waste tank, the area contains
a storage vault for solld Na¥ and Mg’F2 wastes from the UF6 sorption step.

The design of this portion of the waste system is discussed in Appendix B.
Fertile Stream Waste System

Design bases used for fertile-stream waste-storage were:

Thirty -year accumulation in a single waste tank.

Fertile stream power of 62 Mw (thermal).

Only one blanket volume (1783 £t3) discarded in 30 years.
Fission-product heat generation as shown on Figs. 3a and b.
Cooling by natural air convection.

V1w O

It was estimated that the integrated heat generation rate at the end of the
30 -year filling period would be only 5.9 x th Btu/hr, and, if the storage
temperature is allowed to be as high as 900°F, this heat can be dissipated
by about L0 ft2 of cooling surface. Therefore 1t 1s only necessary to
place cooling surfaces over the tank cross section in locations that shorten
the path for heat conduction thrcugh the salt. Twelve L-in.-diam pipes
equally spaced over the cross section are provided to remove internal heat.
Regions of salt most distant from a cooling surface might be molten during
some period in tank lifetime, but this will not present a corrosion problem
because cooling surfaces will always be covered with a Ifrozen salt layer.
The storage tank is 13.5 ft in diameter and 13.5 It high, providing
about 1900 ft3 of storage volume. ©Stainless steel can be used in the
construction because only occasionally will molten LiFJThFhufission product
mixture contact a metal surface. The tank is contalned in an underground

concrete vault as shown on Drawing 58081-C, Appendix F.
