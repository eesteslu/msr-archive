PRELIMINARY DESIGN STUDY OF A CONTINUOUS FLUORINATION—
VACUUM -DISTILIATION SYSTEM FOR REGENERATING FUEL AND
'FERTILE STREAMS IN A MOLTEN SALT BREEDER REACTOR

 C. D. Scott
. W. L. Carter

ABSTRACT

The purpose of this study was to make a preliminary
design and an engineering evaluation of a conceptual plant
for treating the fuel and fertile streams of a molten-salt
breeder reactor. The primary requirements of the process
aré to recover the unburned fuel (©33UF)) and fuel-stream

carrier salte (LiF -BeFo) from the fuel stream, and the
%83

LiF -ThF), plus the bred <33U from the fertile stream. Both
streams must be sufficiently decontaminated for attractive
breeding performance of the reactor. The plant was designed
to operate continuously as an integral part of the reactor
system, fitting into two relatively small cells adjacent to
the reactor cell. In thls study, the plant capacity is
based upon treating 15 f£t3/day of fuel salt end 105 ft3/day
of fertile salt removed as side streams. These capacities
are adequate for a 1000-Mw (electrical) power reactor.

As to the fuel stream, basically it is purified by
fluorination and vacuum distillation. The first step
removes uranium as volatile UFg; the second recovers the
LiF -BeF, by simultanecusly volatilizing these two compo-
nents from the less volatile fission products. Fortunately,

-the fission products so separated are primarily the rare-

earths, which are the most serious neutron poisons. The

- UFg from the fluorlnator is accompanied by some volatile
fission product fluorides,\primarlly those of Mo, Te, Ru,
.Zr, and Nb, which are removed by sorption on granular NaF

- and MgF,. Finally, the UFg is reduced to UF), by hydrogen
.and- recomblned with the decontaminated LiF-BeFp carrier in

e -single operation Fission products are removed from the

plant by discard of NaF and MgF sorbents and the still -

residue, which is a highly concentrated solution of the rare

.earths in LiF. Wastes -are permanently stored underground

With respect to the fertile stream, the process consists
only of fluorination followed by decontamination of the UFg
on NaF and MgFs sorbents. It is only necessary to remove the

. bred 33y sufficiently fast to keep a low concentration in

the blanket, thereby ensuring a low flssion rate and negligible

- poisoning by fission products. Discard of the barren fertile
stream at a slow rate suffices to keep the fission product
concentration at a tolerable level.

The chief conclusions of this study are: (1) that the
fluorination-distillation process for the fuel stream and the
fluorination process for the fertile stream comprise a compact
and relatively simple system that can be engineered with &
normal smount of developmental work, and (2) that integration
of the processing plant into the reactor facility is both
feasible and economical and the logical way to take advantage
of the processing possibilities of a fluid -fueled reactor.

The nominal cost of this plant is presented in the. follOW1ng
summary of maJor items:

Process equipment and building space $5, 302,000

Fuel salt inventory - o 89, 500
Fertile salt inventory - : 69, 200
NaK coolant inventory : 40, 000
Direct operating cost | 788 OOO/year

Thesg costs contribute about 0.2 mill/kwhr to the fuel cycle
cost when the reactor operates at an 80% plant factor and
capital charges are amortized at 10%/year. This cost is-
sufficiently low to add to the incentive for developing the
- molten-salt breeder reactor.

Some of the steps of the evaluated process are based_on
well -established technology, whereas others are based on

extrapolations of laboratory and small -scale engineering data.

Fluoride volatility and associated UFg decontamination by
sorption are well -known operations, having been demonstrated
in a pilot plant. However, vacuum distillation and liquid-
phase reduction of UFslto'UFg have been demonstrated only at
the bench. Certainly, more evelopment of these steps is
required for a complete process demonstration. A singularly
serious problem is the corrosive nature of the fluorine-molten
salt mixture in the fluorinator. However, this study shows
that this and other inherent processing problems can be solved
by proper design and operation of equipment. ‘

~ INTRODUCTION

A reactor concept that has a high potential for economic production of

“nuclear power and simultaneous breeding of fissile material on the thorium-

uranium fuel cycle is'the,molten-salt’breeder reactor (MSBR). This reactor
utilizes two fluid streams. .For this study, the stream compositions are:

(1) a fuel stream consisting of an LiF -BeF,, (69-31 mole %) carrier that
contains the fissile component, and (2) a fertile stream, which surrounds
the fuel stream, consisting of a T1L-29 mole % LiF—ThFh_mixture. In each
stream the lithium is about 99.995 at % T14. The above compositions are
not unique, other MSER designs might use different compositlons 39 The con -

from the fuel stream into the surrounding fertile stream, where capture
average temperature of about 650 C; fission energy is recovered in external.

Sustained breeding performance of the MSBR depends on the removal of
fission and corrosion products from the two fluid streams 80 that parasitic
neutron capture is. kept to a tolerable rate. Portions of the two circu-
lating streams are continuously removed,. processed for removal of fission
products, fortified with makeup fissile and fertile materials, and returned
to the reactor in a cyclic: operation.

A primary consideration of any process for recycling reactor fuel is
intolerable capital 1nvestment or operating expense. In the MSBR system,

above, the fuel is 33U, and one. carrier component is the highly enridhed
7Ld isotope. The other maJor constituents, beryllium and thorium, are less
expensive; yet large losses of ‘these cannot be tolerated either because of

© 'The work reported here 1s unique in that it examines a processing
plant integrated directly_into the reactor system, which, in effect,

accomplishes on-stream processing. This method obviates the cumbersome

 
 

 

 

. - h.o

and expensive transfer of highly iadioactive'material by'carfier shipment;-
furthermore, common use can be made of services and equipment necessary
to the reactor, thus avoiding the duplication that results in a separate
- processing bﬁilding.‘ Also, since the spent fuel flows directly into the °
processing plant, there is minimal out-of -pile inventory of valuable fuel
components.' | o

Another interesting feature of this study is the use of the relatlvely
recent,concept of wvacuum dlstlllatlon,as a means of purifying the carrier
salt. A modest vacuum of only l_t072 mm Hg is required, but the tempera-
ture (about 1000°C) is higher than any normally encounteréd in handling
mblten fluoride salts. The operation was explored first by Kelley> in
1aboratory experiments that indicated LlF-Be'F2 decontamination from -
fission products by factors of 102 to 103 ‘The attractiveness of the
process lies in the fact that it involves ohly a physical operation that
is easily controlled and that can be made continuous. Fission products
can be concentrated in the still residue (primarily TLiF) by a factor of
about 250 by using the decay heat of the fission produéts to volatilize
LJ'.'F--ZBeIF2
the valuable 7L:L. Cyclic operatlon of the still was assumed, allowing

This high concentratlon factor ensures a low discard rate for

the fission product concentration to increase with time. The corresponding
increase in the rate of decay heat generation limited the cycle tlme to
about 68 days. Although limited experience with the distillation step
indicates that high-nickel alloys are satisfactory structural meterials
 for use at this relatively high operating temperature, a more extensive
investigation is needed to define the design limitations. |

A novel idea has also been studied in the evaluation of liquid-phase
reduction of UF6 to UFh by hydrogen. Initial bench-scale experimentse6
have given promising data. The reaction is carried out by absorbing UF6‘
in a molten mixture of LiF -BeF, -UF) ai about 600°C followed by contacting
with Hé to reduce UF6 in situ. This technique avoids the troublesome .
problem of remotely handling solids (small Ur), particles) that would be
met 1f the customary gas-phase reduction of UF6 were used.

Aside from indicating the fea31b111ty and economy of the process,
this study also uncovered important design and engineering problems
associated with the scaleup of laboratory and batchwise operations to .

The dota presented in Table 1 are typical for the MSBR and were the
bases for this study Since the reactor concept is undergoing engineer-
ing and physics evalustion, these data represent no fixed design and are
subject to change as the studies progress. |

'DESIGN CRITERIA |

The follow1ng discuss10n delineates ground rules and. arguments for
the particular cholice of process and design used in this evaluation.
Cholces were made on the basis of eXisting knovledge and data. The study

presented here is expected to verify ba31c assumptions or 1nd1cate

~Judicious alternatives.

Basic Considerations |

One basic consideration concerns the fuel yield (the fraction of

fissile inventory'bred per year) which, for & breeder reactor, is inversely

.proportional to the total inventory of the reactor and chemical plant
'W-szstems.- This characteristlc is ‘essential to the _design of an MSER pro-
"dcessing plant and suggests close-coupling of the reactor and processing
iﬂplant to give minimal out-of-reactor inventory. A fluid-fueled system

is. readily amenable to this type of operation, and for this evaluation

-the processing plant is integreted with the reactor plant., This design

permits fast, continuous processing,'restricted only by the rather

"stringent design requirements for fission-product decayéheat removal and

"f'corrosion resistance._'-

The integrated plant occupies cells adjacent to the reactor cell, and

- all serv1ces available to the reactor are available to the chemical plant.

These include mechanical equipment, compressed gases, heating and ventilat-

ing equipment, electricity, etc. ~ The cost sav1ngs for an integrated

facility are immediately apparent when one conS1ders the large amount of
equipment and facility duplication required for separate plants.

A further basic con31deration is that there will be no large
extrapolation of technology in the process design. Accordingly, the
process is based on treating the molten salt by fluorination and distillsa-

tion, with the supportlng operations. of UF6 sorption on and desorptlon |

- from beds of pelletized NaF, followed by reduction of the UF6 to UFh- A

tion and reduction operations, both of which have been demonstrated in

engineering extrapolations to convert from the current batchwise operations

to continuous operations."
Process for the Fertile Stream

The two streams of the'breederrreactor require different processing

rates and must be treated separately to prevent cross contamination. The

first step in process for the fertile stream consists only of continuous

fluorination, which removes the bred uranium as the volatile hexafluoride
No other treatment is needed 1f this step is designed to maintain a low

uranium concentration. To accomplish this, the stream is required to go r

'.‘through the processing plant on a relatively short cycle, for example,

once every 20 to 50 days. The cycle time for this study is 22 days. The

'“ifission rate in the blanket is low, and the fission- products are kept at
“a tolerable level by periodic discard of barren LiF-ThFh salt. A 30-year
| discard cycle suffices. In the second step, the volatilized UF6 is sorbed

on NaF beds, desorbed, and finally caught in cold traps.

Process for the Fuel Stream .

The fuel stream of the reactor is processed by fluorination and

vacuum distillation to recover both uranium and carrier salt sufficiently

" deconteminated of f1351on products. A cycle time of 40 to 70 days is

required to maintain the f1551on-product concentration at a low enough

Jevel for attractive breeding performance The calculations of this study

 
 

 

~10 -

are for a 58-day cycle. The UF6 is recbvered by NaF sorption and cold
traps, just as for the fertile stream. Decontaminated fuel and carrier
are fecombined in a reduction step that converts UF6 to UFh and further
~ purifies by reducing corrosion products (iron, nickel, chrOmium) to their -
'getallic states. Makeup fuel and carrier are added at this point, and v
the stream is returned to the reactor.
The time that the fuel stream spends in the processing plant is kept

as short as practicable to minimize out-of -reactor inventory.
'Waste Storage | » -

The chemical plant provides its own storage system for protess

wastes. Incidental wastes, such as slightly contaminated aquéous_solﬁiions
.and flush salts, are assuméd to be handled by the peactor'waste system,
- thus such facilities are not duplicated for the processing plant. ‘Separate
storage is provided for fuel-and fertile-stream wastes, which are primarily
LiF plus fission products, and LiFJThFh, respectively. The facilities are
designed for a 30-year capacity and are located underground a short
distance from the chemical processing area. |

, The fuel -stream process also prbduces 8 less radioactive waste than the
LiF-fissionfprdduct mixture. This waste is in the form of pellets of sodium
fluoride and magnesium fluoride pellets used for decontaminating uranium hexa -

fluoride. Interim storage of 5-year duration is provided for these solids.
" Fission-product decay heat is removed either by foréed air or natural

]

convection, as required by the heat load.

Operating Policy

Summary of the Process Flowsheet

In Fig. i it can be seen that fuel-stream processing is achieved by
first removing the uranium (as 233UF6) and volatile fission products from ~
a side-stream of the molten salt by flﬁqrination. Then the carrier salt
is vacuum-distilled frbﬁ the residual fission products. Next, the UF6,
further purified by a sorption-desorption process based on the use of NaF
| pellets, is dissolved in the carrier salt. Finally, the UF6 is reduced |
to UFh by hydrogen, thereby reconstituting the fuel salt.

. Blanket salt is processed concurrently with the fuel salt by
'fluorinating a side-stream. The UF6,gas is separated from the volatile
fission-product fluorides by sorption and desorption, using beds of NaF
pellets as mentioned above. The blanket saltlneeds no further purification,
and a portion of the|233UF6 is sent to the fuel stream by dissdlving it in
the carrier salt and reducing it with hydrogen. The excess over that
needed to refuel the reactor is sold. | o

The two chemical reactions (fluorination and reduction) in the
process are simple, fast, and quantitative. The other interaétions are
physicél and require only heat and mass transpoft; however, in the case
of distillation, & rather high temperature (about 1000°C) is involved.

The salt is extremely stable at any temperature anticipated in this
process, and other physical properties, primarily vapor pressure and

solubility for fission products, are in accord with process requirements.

Fluorination

i

As noted above, uranium and volatile fiSsion products are removed
from both streams by fluorination. A batchwise, molten-salt fluoride-
volatility pfocess for recovering uranium has been under develbpmenf for
several years. Currently the process is in the pildf plﬁnt‘phase at

ornL. L7718

~ One of the steps in this process is batch fluorination of the

molten fluorides to remove'uranium:hexafluoride. As noted before, uranium

in these streams is in the form ofUFh.  This uranium and some of the

fission products are converted by fluorine to higher-valent, volatile 7 iﬁ)

fluorides which leave the salt and go to the uranium hexafluoride

purification system. The reaction for producing UF6 in the~preéent batch
processing is the same as that for the proposed continuous system.and mey

be represented as follows: |

Certain fission-product fluorides are also volatile. The principal
ones are: Ru, Nb, Cs, Mo, and Te. Zirconium is volatilized to a'lesser
degree. | _ |

Continuous processing of the MSBR fuel salt can be best achieved if
 the fluorination process is made cbntinuous, preferably with counter-
current contacting of the molten salt and fluorine. Such a 'process has
not been developed, and the present volatility process at ORNL is entirely
a batch proéess. Therefore, deveiopment work will be necessary to provide
for continuous fluorination. - _ |

__Rate data for molten-salt fluorination are limited and conflicting,
although the reported rafes have been sufficient for the batch process.
Mailen's datalg on the fluorination of falling droplets of molten salt
support the view that the reaction itself is very fast; whereas, the
slower rates that result from sparging a pool of molten Salt with fluorine
(Cathers 93_21:,20 Pitt,21 and Moncrief22) can be explained by assuming a
mass -transfer ~controlling rate mechanism due to inefficient mixing of the
gas and liquid phases. Contact times (fluorine and molten salt) of 1 to
2 hr have been shown to be adequate for uranium removal down to 10 ppm in
such batch tests. The countercurrent, continuous operation, eﬁvisioned
here, would probably give better contact. It is difficult to predict the
fluorine utilization in a continuous fluorinator; however, it should be
better than that for batch fluorinétion, which suggésts that a utilization
of 33-1/3% will probably be achieved. | |

A relatively low mass flow rate of gas must be maintained in the
fluorinator to prevent salt entrainment in the off-gas. The highest mass
flow rate that has been used succeésfully without entrainment is 0.28 slpm
per in.2 of fluorinator crOSé section.23 -

Experience in the Volatility Pilot Plant at ORNL showed that
corrosion on bare metal walls (L-nickel) in the fluorinator is relatively

Molybdenum fluoride is removed from the UFg by isolating the 100°C
NeF zone, desorbing the UF and molybdenum fluoride (by raising the
temperature to >150 °c and passing fluorine through the bed), and passing |
desorbed gas through a fixed bed of MgFQ, which is held at about 150 °c.
The MgF, sorbs the molybdenum but al}ows the purif;ed UF6 to pass through_
into the cold traps. ‘

The NaF pellets used in the hlghatemperature zone must be replenlshed
perlodically_81nce they accumulate fission products and corrosion‘products.
This discard constitutes one of the waste streams. The two NaF sorption
zones may be integrated into a single unit, one zone on the other, and, as
NaF is discharged from the lower zone, it can be réplenished by NaF from
the low-temperature zone, which is in turn fed with fresh NaF pellets.
Such a system has been used effectively in pilot plant operations, and a
similar system would be desirable for the MSBR processing facility. 17’18
In our concept, the system has a movable bed of NaF pellets, and, after
each sorption cycle, some of the lower NaF is mechanically ejected to.
-waste. Annular design with air cooling would probably be necessary to
allow removal of fission product heat (Fig. 7).

As the UF6 leaves the last sorption trap it must be collected and
ultimately used as feed for the fuel-reconstitution step. This is done
by collecting the UF6 in cold traps. Two cold traps are connected in -
series. The first, or primary trap, is operated at about -10%, and the
second, or backup trap, is operated at about -60 C. The principal design
" consideration is thelheat transfer rate. Convéntional désigns are avail -
able for such units in which there are internal cooling fins for collecting
UF,, and Calrod heaters for vaporizing the UF, for removal (Fig. 8).
Uranium hexafluoride from the heated cold trap is fed directly to the
reduction process. This calls for at least three primary-cold traps fprl
;continuous operation:; one for collecﬁing UF6,~one for feeding UF6, and
one in transition between these two functions.

A fixed bed of NaF at ambient temperature very effectively removes
trace amounts of UF6 frdm gas streams. Such beds are used as backuplUF6
traps in the fluorine exhaust from the cold traps and in other process
streams that might'contain UF6. Uranium is recovered from such traps by

using the NaF as charge material for the main absorption beds.

Since‘there is excess fluorine in the fluorinator off-gas (33-1/3%
utilization), fluorine is recycled. This recycle contains some fission
products, so it is necessary to remove & side-stream (10%) to prevent
their buildup. Fresh fluorine is used for\the‘desorption_step, for all

processing in the blanket section, and for fluorine makeup.
-Vacuum Distillation
The vacuum distillation;Step'applies to the fuel stream only and is

used to separate the'carrierISalt from the fission products after the
uranium is removed by fluorination (see above) The LiF and BeF,,

| volatilize, leaving fission products ‘in the still bottoms This residue -

consists largely of rare -earth fluorides. If the relative volatilities
of the fission products, compared with the volatilities of LiF and Be‘F2
are low, then a good separation can be achieved in a s1ngle-step
distillation without rectification.

At the average operating temperature (about 650 C) of +the MSBR itself,
the solubility of rare-earth fluorides in fuel salt is only a few. mole \
percent; however, at 1000° C, ‘the solubility in LiF alone is about 50 mole %
for the more insoluble compounds, for example, LaF 3? PrF3; and CeF3 Other
rare -esrth (RE) fluorides have even higher solubilities at this temperature.

Physics calculations on the 58-day—cycle MSBER indicate that at equilibrium

5

-the molar ratio of InF (RE)F in the fuel is about 1400, & number consid-
_J erably greater than the 1: 1 ratio permitted by the solubility limit at

J:lOOO C. It is therefore apparent that, hased on solubility data alone,

: distillation at about 1000 C can tolerate an extremely large rare-earth

concentration factor before precipitation occurs. The design of the
distillation unit is concerned. prlmarily with determining the approprlate

* Appendix D), ‘and the temperature is adjusted and held at about 1000°C..

Fluorinated fuel salt is~continuously admitted to the LiF pool in the
still, and distillation is allowed to proceed at the same rate as the
1nlet fuel rate 80 that there is no net volume change. \ |

The operating principle is to allow the rare-earth fission products,

- which have a much lower vapor pressure then either LiF or BeF2, to con-

centrate in the still. Thekliquid pool in the still reaches an equilibrium
concentration in LiF and Berg-and the two components then distill at the

rate at which each is entéring the still. The condenser is a conical

- region located just above the evaporating surface; it is kept at about

850°C by forced convection of heated air. Distillate is collected in a
circular trough and drained to a product receiver. The still is operated
in this way until the heat-generation rate due to fission-product decay
reaches the heat-removalrcapability of the NeX cooiing system. This

- point occurs after about 67 days of continuous operation, at which time

the fission product concentration in the still is about 1% mole %, a
value considerabLy less then the approxrmately 50 mole % solubility limit

at 1000 ®c. At this time,. the contents of the still are drained to a

permanent waste receiver, and ‘the cycle is repeated. These calculations
are conservative since they are based upon gross fiss10neproduct heat
release and do not subtract the effect of those fission products removed

or deposited in the reactor before chemical processing.
The attractive feature of carrying out the distillation in this way

';_1s that it minimizes the volume of expensive LiF relegated to waste.r
Since distillation is carried out after fluorination, less than 0.1% of
"the uranium removed from the reactor should enter the still, and at 1000°C
.. the’ vapor pressure of . UFh is favorable to the recovery of a significant
'~portion of this fraction, reducing the overall uranium loss. Beryllium
. fluoride losses should be insignificant ‘because the vapor pressure of -
"BeF at 1000 °c 1s about 100 times that of LiF, DistllLation probably
hlwill not effect decontamination from CsF and RbF; each of these com-
,pounds has a greater vapor pressure than ‘either BeF2 or LiF. Because

rare earths are concentrating in the still as a function of time, their

decontamination factor in the product will decreasse with time. It is not

possible with existing data to assess the:magnitude of this effect.

3.2 x 107 Btu/hr to 6.8 x 106, imposing less stringent design requirements

in the permanént waste receiver. The interim receiver is a shell-and-
tube type, similar to the still; however, no condensing surface or

provisions for air cooling are needed.
Reduction of Urenium Hexafluoride and Reconstitution of the Fuel

The combined UFy streams, that form the fuel salt and the fertile
salt, are reduced to lIF,_L, and only a sufficient amount to maintain
criticality is returned to the reactor. The excess 233U from the fertile
stream is sold. The usual method for this reduction has been by reaction
with the excess Hé in an H24F2 flame:

(H2+F2) : ’ -

> UFh + 2HF .

 

We + Hy
This reduction-is carried out in a tall colum into which UFg and H, are
introduced into an HééFe flame, and dxry UFM powder is collected as the
product. However, according to our proposal, a more convenient method
for preparing UFh for the MSBB is by reducing the UF6 to UFH with Hé
after the UF6 is dissolved in the molten salt. There'are some experimental
date indicating the feasibility of such a process; however, the kinetics
of the absorption and of the reduction must be further investigated.® It

is possible that this two-step process could be carried out continuously.

in a single column in which the molten salt flows upward, the UF6 is

lines which lead to the scrubber for remov1ng HF, fluorine, and volatile

_ when the vault contains 160 cylinders 1s ‘about 1.73 x 106 Btu/hr. Forced
- eirculation of about 11,300 scfm of air at a temperature rise of 125 °C is

used to remove this energy. The containers are constructed with a hollow

| core, allowing coolant to pass through the c¢ylinder as well as over the

outside.

Aqueous Waste from Off-Gas Scrubberr

’This waste, fission productS'in'a strong solution of KOH, will be

stored along with other aqueous wastes from the reactor system and.

'represents an insignificant contribution to the total amount of aqueous o

waste."

tion of vaste is prov1ded.: The 30-year capaclty was chosen since that is

. the expected 1ifetime of the reactor. After filling, the salt might

remain in the tank for additional decay or be disposed of by whatever

method is currently acceptable.'

Decey heat is removed by forced air convection. The heat load (Btu/hr) .
continually increases over’the filling_period but decreases rather sharply -
vhen no further additions are made (Fig. E-1, Appendix E). The time
behavior of the integrated specific heat gemeration rate (Btu hr T £t75)
for a 5-year collection period is shown in Fig. 11. This is a smoothed
curve for h-rt3 additions every 67.h'days? followed by an extended decay
period during which no waste is added;to the tank. The upper portion of
the curve might be extrapolated with little error to accommodate longer
filling periods. Figure 11 shows the specific heat generatioh for the
case of no dilution with inert salt; however, during the'initial stages , 2
of filling, it is necessaryrto add an inert diluent, for example, NaF -KF
eutectic mixture, to lower the specific rate to a tolerablé value. It
was calculated that 264 £t of diluent is required for the 520 £t3 of
LiF ~-fission product residue fo be collected over the 30 -year period. The
fission products being collected exhibit the decay behavior shown in
Fig. 2, which is repreéentative of gross fission products and does nbt

account for those that have been removed by processing or other mechanisms.

Fertile-Stream Waste

 

The fertile-stream discard is also stored in a large underground tank,
adequate for 30 years of waste collection. The tank is 13.5 ft in diameter
end 13.5 £t high. Since uranium is removed from the blanket on & rather
fast cycle, the fission rate in the blanket is low, makiné the waste
activity several orders of magnitude less than that of the fuel waste. | s
 Cooling is provided by natural\air convection around the tank and through
cooling tubes. All metal surfaces are expected to be coated with a layer
of frozen salt that will furnish excellent corrosion protection. ' o
The integrated heat production rate due to fission'producté for the
30-year period is 5.91 x th Btu/hr. Since this energy is associated
with 1783 £t of IiF-ThF) mixture, the moderate specific rate of 33.1 Btu
nrt e 3 presents no design problems. When first removed from the |

reactor, the heat production rate of the waste is about 1600 Btu nrt

ft '3,
but this value decreases by a factor of 10 in about U4 days.

Cooling System for the Waste

As mentioned above, the waste-storage system is designed for cooling
by forced air draft. Air is easy to handle, compatible with coqstruction
materials for extremely long times, and presents & minimum hazard in case
of contamination by the ﬁaste.r Blowers, capable of supplying 76,000 scfm
at a pressure drop of about 30 in. water, are located upstream from the
waste vaults. The air is fofced through the vaults end cooling tubes in
the waste tank and is exhausted to the atmosphere via a tall stéck, which
also disposes-of gases exhausted from the reactor system. The exit duct
contains the necessary fadiatioﬁemonitoring instruments énd absolute

filters for removing particles.

Possible Ultimate Treatment of Waste from Fertile Stream

Since a 30-year accumulation of waste from the fertile stream will
contain recoverable values (7Li, 233U; and thorium), not too highly
contaminated with fission products, it may be worthwhile to consider a
recovery system before relegating this waste to permsnent burial. Any
significant uranium value would probably be recovered by fluorinetion,
but_thé recovery of thorium_and.lithium requires further brocess develop-
ment. A potential method for Li-Th separation is the incompletely
investigated HF -dissolution process,l5 based on the principle of leaching
LiF from ThF) and rare-earth fission products with anhydrous hydrofluoric
acid. This process, however, leaves the thorium contaminated with fission
products, making it necessary to resort to an aqueous system (solvent
extraction by the Thorex process) or to develop a thorium recovery process
that utilizes fluoride chemistry. From a purely econcmic viewpoint, |
thorium would bevretained in the waste tank until its recovery beceme more
economical than mining new thorium. - |

On a 30-year discard cycle, an eﬁtire fertile stream inventory of
ThF), and LiE will accumulate in the waste tank.- In sddition, the wastg
will contain 233U, 233Pa, and fission products in amounts that depend on
the breeding ratio, efficiency of the fluorination step, and the blanket
power. The uranium loss is based upon & 90% efficiency in fluorination,

e value believed to be conservative. The largest loss of fissionable
 

 

e

material, however; is through'protactinium, which we assume to be non-
volatlle as the fluoride and which consequently is discarded in direct
ratio to its concentration. The amount of fission products is calculated

~ for a blanket power of 62 Mw (thermal) and an 80% plant factor; to account

for those fission products that have volatile fluorides or which are
plated out on parts of the system, & nominal figure of 80% is used for
the fraction that finally reaches the waste tank. .The 30-year inventory
of the waste tank is shown in Table 2. |

In view of the figures in Table 2, the de51gn presented here for the
fertile-stream waste system is not optimal. Nearly 99.5% of the 233U + 233Pa
value in the waste tank is attrlbutable to 33Pa dlscard this loss can be

| reduced to negligible proportions by providing 1n-cell decay storage

“decay to 33U It probably would not be necessary to provide additional
7ifluorination equlpment for this volume because the refluorlnation could be

- scheduled in exmsting equipment durlng reactor shutdown.

Flow.Control'ofthe Salt Streams

Flow control of the molten salt streams is'by freeze valves coupled

. with a controlled pressure drop. Thls can be achieved by the simple

freeze valve currently used in the MSRE (Molten Salt Reactor'Experlment),

 

 
 

 

- 36'-

. !‘ - .
coupled with a flow restriction such as an orifice or venturi. A dynesmic
freeze valve in vhich a controlled layer of salt is bullt up in a éooled
section of the line is being éxr;vestigated.; if successful, it will allow &

greater ease of flow control.
Removal of Decay Heat

Heat removal is a major problem in all process vessels that contain
~ short-cooled, highly irradiated fuel. In many cases, the heat flux and
operating temperature will be high, meking it difficult to use water or
' air as primary coolants. Water has an additional disadvantage in that it~
is incompatible with the process fluids, creating a hazard should there
be & leak in the salt lines. Therefore, a sodium-potassium eutectic
mixture, 22.3-77.7 wt % ﬁa-K; wis chosen as the primsry coolant for 7
process vessels at temperatures above 50000 where large amounts of decéy
heat must be removed. This coolant also has the capability of initially
heating the system to 600°C for startup purposes. Air was chosen as the
coolant for low heat fluxes at temperatures less than 50090.

Sampling the Salt and Off-Gas Streams

- A rather complicated mechanism is required to remove analytical
samples from a highly radioactive molten-salt system. A technique similar
to that tested for the MSRE will be used.,28 and the off-gas streams will

be sampled conventionally.
Shielding, Maintenance, and Repair of Equipment

All process equipment that handles material that approaches the
radiation level in the reaétor core will be shielded by about the same
amount of shielding as for the reactor, and maintenance will be indirect.
Process vessels in this area needing répair will be removed and sent‘to a
decontamination facility before repair. These include'the.fuel-stream
delay tanks, fluorinator, sorption-desorption systems, and distilletion

systen. All;other equipment for processing radioactive materials is

conteined in an area of direct maintenance with less shielding. In'the

1direct4maintenance area, decontamination for maintenance is achieved by

a molten-salt flush end an aqueous wash.

‘Materials of Construction

All process vessels and lines in'contact'with molten salt are made
of INOR-8 except the fluorinators, which are made of a special material,
Alloy T9-k. =8 Vessels and'lines that contain fluorine or fluoride -bearing
gases are made of Inconel or Monel, and cold traps are made of copper.

Otherrequipment is made of appropriately compatible material.
General Operating Policy
The overall policy for operating the fluorinator, vaouumfstill, NaF

beds, and related equipment is based on the projected simplicity of opera-
tion and small size of the equipment. The system is designed for a

* campaign-type operation of one month's duration, without shutdown except

for emergency maintenance. ;There will be no access to the operating areas
during'this period. At the end of the operating period, the entire system

~ will be closed down, routine maintenance accomplished, feed hoppers

replenished, acenmulated waste transferred to waste storage, etc. The

operating cycle is then repeated.

_PROCESS DE'S'IGN; '

' -pos51ble after previously designed and tested equipment. Each major

"'.component was studied for its application to the continuous proces51ng

requirements of the MSBR to ensure a practical design. Detailed designs

were made to the extent\that overall size, configuration; heat transfer

PIANT DESIGN AND LAYOUT

The inherent advantage of a fluid -fueled reactor is in closeecoupiing
the reactor and processing plants, thereby reducing capital investment,
inventory, and operating costs. This conceptual MSBR proceésing plant is
- located in two cells adjacent to the reactor shield; one contains the high-
radiation-level operations, and the other contains the lower-radiation- |
level operations. Each cell is designed for top access through & remov-j
able biological shield having a thickness equivalent to 6 ft of high-
density concrete. Both cells are served by & crane used in common with
the reactor plant. -Process equipment is located in the cell for remote .
removal and‘réplacement from above. No access into the cells will be |
required; however, it is possible with proper decontamination to allow
limited access into the lower-radiation-level cell. A general plan of
the processing plant and a partial view of the reactor system is shdwn
in Dwg. 58050D in Appendix F. |

The highly radiocactive cell contains onlyrfuel-stream processing
equipment: +the fluorinator, still, waste receiver, NaF and MgF2 sorbers,
and associated vessels. The other cell houses the blanket-processing Qi)~
equipment, fuel- and fertile-stream cold traps, UF6 reduction equipment,

and fuel- and fertile-stream makeup vessels. - S | .

© The high-radiation-level cell has a cross section of about 19 by

22 ft; the less radioactive cell measures about 27 by 30 ft. Each cell
is about L0 ft high, the same as that of the ad301n1ng reector cell. A
"cold" operating area, 1ocated along the face of the cells, has dimensions

212 by 62 ft and contains the cold makeup equipment, product receivers, and

process -gas supply. All process operatlons are carried out remotely from

the reactor control room.
COST ESTIMATE

One of the major goels in this des1gn study was to estimate the cost
of an integrated facility for processing the fuel and blanket salts for

‘this conceptusl 1000-Mw (electrical) MSBR. The estimate arrived at

includes the total fixed capital cost and the annusl operating cost B
which are, respectively, $5,301,510 and $787,790 per year. In general,
conventional - estimating practices were used except where past experience
in the nuclear energy field indicated changes. 29-32
It is difficult to separate the process building and its equipment

from the total reactor facility for costnestimating purposes, since the

"building must be an integrsl part of the reactor installation. To

determine the relationship between the costs of integrated processing
plent and the reactor building, it was assumed that the Molten Salt
Converter Reactor (MSCR) facility, des1gned by Sargent and Lundy
Eng1neers,33 represented the nonprocessing part of an MSBR.. Any required

"~ addition to the structure, facilityy or operating cost of the MSCR dne to

the addition of the proce851ng facility was considered a cost of the-

7processing facility. . o oy

ﬂTne installation charge for a conponent to be installed in an .

Structure and Improvements

Structure and improvements costs for the processing facility were
determined by assuming that these’cosfs are directly related to corre-
sponding costs developed for the MSCR by Sargent and Lundy Engineers.33
Addition of the processing faclility proposed here called for an additional-'
16.56% of floor spaece in the reactor building, and this factor was used |
to determine the cost from the corresponding MSCR data. The cost of the
crane and hoist was also increased by this amount. This additional space
includes a 10% increase in analytical and decontamination facilities. |
The processing facility addition was 7.3% of the total building area;
therefore, cost of the grounds and stack was increased by 7.3%. The
total increase in cost of structure and improvements due to the processing

facility was $556, 770, which was obtained as follows:

Structure - 0.1656 x $2,932,400 = $485,610
Crane and hoist - 0.1656 x 195,000 = 32,290
Grounds - 0.073 x 501,500 = 36,610
Stack _ ~ 0.073 x 31,000 = 2,260

- Other Plant Costs

Significant cost items in the indirectémaintenance area of the plant
are the process line "jumpers", which have remote connectors necessary
for indirect connection of pipelines, instrumentation-lines; and electrical
) 1ines' The following cost schedule, based on experience at ORNL, was used

for estimating the cost of these connections 32
Mejor pipelines | $1,5oo/1ine
Multiple pipe and instrumentation lines $l,700/set
Electrical heater connection, including the |
heater . a $2,000/set'

The above cost schedule results 1n a total processfpiping cost of $155,800.
The electrical auxiliaries consisted of the electrical substation,

) sw1tching gear, feeders, and 1ndirect connectors and Jumpers. Cost

schedules used for these auxiliaries were: 29

~ Process instrumentation is estimated to be $272 100, radiation
p~monitoring to be $100,000, and sampling connections to be $20,000.

~ The costs of service lines and highatemperature insulation are based
on the installed cost of the process equipment in the mein processing

 

 
 

areas'and in the waste storage facility. The cost of éervice.lines, faken'
at 15% of the total installed cost of this equipment, amounts to $128,060;
the cost of the insulation, taken at 6% of this installed cost, amounts to
$51, 220. |

Total Fixed Capital Cost

‘The total direct plant costs are estimated to be $2,609,980 (Table 5).

Past experience was used to determiﬁe percentage costs of indirect capital

items. These percentages are higher than those for other chemical indus -

‘tries buf represent actual cost experience in other ORNL projects.32

Construction overhead is estimated at 30%tqf total direct plant cost to

give a total construction cost of ‘$3,392,970. Engineering and inspection

at 25% of total construction cost is $8u48,240, which results in & sub-

total plant cost of\$h,2hl,216. Contingency at 25% of the subtotal plant

cost is $l,060,300, and the total construction cost is $5, 301, 510.
Inventory costs include the cost of the molten salt held up in the

system and the initial cost of the NaK coolant. Total fuel-salt holdup

for this system is 63 3. At $1,h20/ft3, the charge is $89,h6o; Blanket -

salt holdup is 120 ft3,'and at $560/ft3 the cost is $67,200, Fuel - and.

. blanket -salt charges do not include the cost of fissile material.- The

400 -£3 holdup of NsK at $100/f'b3 costs $40,000. The total inventory

cost is then $196,660, giving a total fixed capital cost of $5,498,170.

" Direct Operating Cost

| The direct operating cost includes the cost of operators, chemical
consumption, waste containers, utilities, and maintenance materials. The
" number of operating and support employees is based on a work schedule of
four éhifts of 40 hr each per week. These include immediate supervisory,
operating, maintenance, laboratorj; and health physics personnei, pius
two people for routine clerical and jenitorial work (Table 6).

 No attempt was made to prorate the cost ofrhigher supervisory,
clerical, or plant protection personnel for the processing facility since

some of this cost is included in labor overhead costs.

The cost of utilities, waste containers, and consumed chemicals is
based on a 300 day/year operation for both the reactor and pfocessing'
plant. | . |

Total direct operating cost for one year is $610,190 (Table T);

this includes fuel and fertile salt makeup.

Processing Cost

The processing cost per year is estimated at $1,L4U7,570 (Table 8).
This cost is obtained by combining the direct operating cost, the indirect
cost of labor overhead (80% of direct labor cost), the fixed cost due to
depreciation (10% of fixed capital per year), taxes (1% of fixed capital
per year), and insurance (1% of fixed capital per year). The pércentage
used for the indirect labor cost is arbitrary; however, 1t is within the
range of usual practice. , ' |

On the basis of 300 days of operation per year for the 1000-Mw.
(electrical) MSBR, the fuel -processing cost is 0.201 mill/kwhr. The fuel-
cycle cost is composed of this cost plus the in-reactor inventory of fuei,
fertile, and carrier salts, plus makeup fertile and carrier salts, and
less the credit for excess 233UF6 produced. In-reactor inventory, makeup,
and credit were not considered in this study. | o -

Within the applied. ground rules, these costs are bélieved to be a

reasonably accurate representation of the cost for regenerating the fuel
and blanket in an integrated MSBR processing plant. A more thorough
study would have included detailed design of equipment and layout of the

integrated processing plant, the reactor and its auxiliaries. Such a

thorough analysis was beyond the scope of this study.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The central issues in this preliminary study were to analyze the

feasibility and cost

the fuel and fertile

of a conceptual system for continuously regenerating

streams in the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor. Briefly,

the system consists in (1) fluorinating, distilling, and recomstituting

the molten fluorides
233U from the molten

used in the reactor core, and (2) recovering the

breeder blanket by fluorination and using the

uranium to reconstitute the core salt. The éxcess is to be sold. The

pover of the breeder

reactor was set at 1,000 Mw (electrical) for this

A number of basic conclusions and essential recommendations were

developed. The conclusions relate to the projected feasibility and

anticipated costs in

terms of established technology and cost-accounting

practices, and the recommendations refer to what must yet be learned‘with

respect to technology and chemical data before a complete engineering

analysis can be made.

It is our opinion that it will be very useful to

In the conclusions and recommendations presented below, the

'_'reoommendations-are undeflined.; The first four numbered' paragraphs

relate to'general'characteristics of this fuel -processing piant; and

the others to spec1fic unit operat;ons.

1.

FEASIBILITY Fluorinatlon followed by distillatlon is a
feasible process for regenerating MSBR fuel (LiF -BeF,-UF)).
Fluorination alone is sufficient processing for the fertile
salt (LiF-ThF) ). Reactor physics calculations indicate that

attractive breedlng ratios can be obtained for such & process.

Engineering problems in the processing plant appear to be
amenable to solution through & well -planned developmental

~ program &t the unit-operations level. Fluorination-distillation

 

should be developed as the processing method for the MSBR. Con-
currently, other attractive processes should be investigated at
the laboratory and/or engineering stage as potential alternatives.

 

. INTEGRATED PIANT. Integrating processing and reactor facilities

is of primary importance in lowering the processing cost. Com-
plete advantage is thereby taken of the ready adaptability of a
fluid -fueled reactor for continuous processing with corresponding

‘minimum inventory. The relatively small size of this side-
~streanm processing plant, about 12 ££3 salt per day for a 1000 -Mw.

(electrical) reactor, is amenable to integrated construction, -
thereby separating the economic dependence of the processing

~industry upon a large amount of installed electrical capacity.

The same finsncing convention that applies to the power plant

‘applies to the processing plant; this type of financing is

normally avallable at a lower rate than is avallable for &
separated processing fac1lity.

ECONOMY. - The estimated capital cost, excludlng 1nventory) of.
the plant is $5,30l,000, and operating costs are about $788,000

& year. It is significant that the capital investment in the
‘integrated processing plant proposed here is only about h% of
- ‘the total cost of the reactor system it serves..

,'CORROSION. There are at least three areas in the chemical
- processing plant in which corrosion behavior of construction

 

materials should be studied. These are the vacuum still, the

- reduction unit, and-filters. -The still temperature of about

 

1000°C is much higher than has been contemplated for any other

| part of the MSER system, and the resistance of INOR-8 and

- nickel to corrosive attack at this temperature is not known.

- A reducer, hydrogen, enters ‘the reduction unit and probably

Y

helps limit corrosion there,- ‘but this should be verified.

 Filters are subject to attack because of the large surface
area exposed to the fluid being filtered. '

FLUORINATION DEVELOPMENT. Batchwise fluorination of molten
fluoride salts for uranium recovery has been rather thoroughly
investigated at ORNL; however, it is recommended that engineering
development of a continuous fluorinator be glven high priority.
The need for continuous fluorination is evidenced by the require-
ment of low fuel and carrier salt inventories in the processing
plant. The reactor fuel system contains about 650 ft3 of salt,
and, without continuous fluorination, the out-of-pile inventory
could possibly be as large as the in-pile inventory. This

study indicates that in a continuous fluorination-distillation
process the holdup represents about lO% of the reactor fuel
volume.

It is recommended that the frozen-wall concept for a
continuous fluorinsastor be developed and demonstrated. Thils
concept calls for a 1/2- to 3/L-in. ~thick layer of frozen salt
on the inside wall of the fluorinator to prevent the serious
corrosive attack by the molten mixture during fluorination.

Basic information needed includes fluorination rate data, process
control in continuous operation, and method of establlshlng and
maintaining a frozen wall.

- Fluorination of the fertile salt introduces problems
51m11ar to those encountered for the fuel stream. However,
fertile-stream processing rates are 8 to 10 times higher, and
the fission-product activity is several orders of magnitude
less. On the other hand, & lower fluorinatlon eff1c1ency can
be tolerated in blanket processing.

Another method for continuous fluorination is the gas-
phase continuous operation in which fluoride microspheres are
generated and fluorinated as they fall through a tower. This
process should be recognized as a potential alternative to the
continuous method of fluorination studied here, but its
development should be subordinate to that of the frozen-wall
concept.

DISTILIATION DEVELOPMENT. The vacuum-distillation concept for
separating the LiF -BeFo (fuel-carrier salt) from fission products
is feasible_from an engineering viewpoint. The theoretical net
discard of 7Li in the still waste is low enough that its cost is
insignificant compared with other fuel cycle costs. Thermal
problems require that sufficient volume be maintained for wetting
a large heat transfer surface, and the buildup of fission products
in this volume will almost surely have an adverse effect on the
decontamination factor of the distillate. Relative volatility
data are needed for the multicomponent mixture, LiF -BeF,-fission
products, in which compositions are in the range 99.5-0.5-0 mol %
To B4.5-0.5-15 mol % LiF -BeF,-rare earth fiuorides. It is
- strongly recommended that a continuous vacuum still be built and
operated to demonstrate a workable de51gn and to obtain rate and
entrainment data.

The redu01ng conditions that exist in this operation are

- consistent with those required for purging nickel, chromium, and

Therefore the potentiality

SOLID-LIQUID SEPARATION. The general area of high-temperature,
solid -liquid separation in remote operations needs development.
Filtration techniques should surely be investigated to determine
operability and reliability in molten-fluoride systems.

product behavior throughout the processing plant is needed. In

particular, 8ata are needed on the ways in which the various
nuclides partition in-the several processing steps and on the ,

PROTACTINIUM REMOVAL;:"The_most significant advancement in
fertile-stream processing can be made in the development of a
process that removes protactinium. To be effective, the process

- must remove protactinium five to ten times as fast as its decay
~rate; that is, the blanket ‘volume would have to be processed
‘every four to eight days. Simplicity and ease of operation are

obvious requirements. Thus, & process based on forming protac-
tinium oxide by ion exchange appears promising and should be

studied.

 
 

 

- 66 -

Effective removal would obviate the need of sending any
portion of the fertile stream to waste and possibly reduce
makeup cost to that represented by thorium burnup alone. Such
& process is not required for economic operation of the MSER
since fluorination and fractional discard can adequately control
the fission product concentration; however, the potential
advantage of reduced waste cost and improved breeding performance
argues for basic development of a process.

12. FUEL-STREAM WASTE SYSTEM. The most economical method of waste

- management consists in bulk storage in a large heat exchanger
tank. The heat generation problem is so severe that the plant
~waste must be diluted with an inexpensive, inert material, which
complicates future processing fo§ recove£§ of any contained
values. The calculated loss of 'Li and 3U in the fluorination-
distillation process is small, being only 1.5 to 2% of the fuel-
- ecycle cost. *

The possible use of fission-product decay heat should not
be overlooked in the evalustion of an MSBR. The accumulated
waste generates about 4.5 Mw (thermal) throughout most of the
filling period of the waste tank. Thus salt-storage temperature
can be maintained high enough to make the waste tank a source of
high-temperature energy. , ,

13. FERTILE-STREAM WASTE SYSTEM. The fertile-stream waste contains
a significant inventory of valuable materials whose recovery is
probably warranted. At the end-of the 30-year filling period,
the waste tank contains about %hl, 000 kg of Th, 10,400 kg of
TLi, and 116 kg of 233U; the 233U is isotopically pure material,
having been formed almost entirely out of the fission zone.
Although not considered in this study, an in-cell decay period
of about six months followed by refluorination appears to be
advisable for grestly reducing the amount of 233Pa that enters
the waste tank. '

1h. PROCESS CONTROL. This aspect of plant operation was given only
a cursory review in this study, and no areas of unusual control
difficulty were observed. A flow-control device for the molten-
salt stream is needed, and the dynamic freeze-valve concept
should be developed. Analytical and sampling requirements
require a more thorough study than was given here.

APPENDIX A. DESIGN CALCULATIONS FOR FUEL

The unit operotion of fluorination requires temperature control at

thls decay heat through the- walls .of a fluorinator whose size is fixed by

- other process requlrements, such as throughput and re51dence time. If

there is insufficient heat transfer surface’ available for this purpose,
then the salt must be allowed to "cool" before entering the fluorinator.
The solution to this problem is to insert a cooling tank immediately
upstream of the fluorinator. - |

The following calculations pertain to the thérmal design and size of

the fuelfSalt fluorinator.and'the size of the cooling tank. It was

determined that the maximum permissible heat flux for the fluorinator is |
5.31.x th Btu hr"~ ft -3 and that the size is k.75 in. in diameter by |

result of this calculation is a graph of heat generation rate at. the

APPENDIX B. FISSION-PRODUCT HEAT GENERATION RATES
IN THE MOVABLE-EED SORBERS AND NeF WASTE TANKS

Heat generation rates for the following components are presented here:
| Movable -Bed Sorber |
Sodium Fluoride Waste Tanks

Short -Term Cooling Station
for Waste Sodium Fluoride

Interim-Storage of Waste

Fission products, which are volatilized in the fluorinator, accumulate
in the movable-bed sorbers and create a heat source that must be cdnsidered
in the design of these units. Excess heat must be removed so that it does
not interfere with control of bed temperature. Actual removal of the heat
-is not the problem hefe since sorbers, which accomplish this énd,.have'been ‘
designed -and used in the ORNL Volatility Pilot Plant.

The essential problem is to estimate the heat generation ratevdue to
-radiocactive decay of the fission products present in the system projectéd
here. This was done by first assuming that,half the'fissionfprodﬁct heat
generating capacity which reached the fluorinator would exit to the sorber.
Further, all the fission-product heat is concentrated in the‘lower'zone in
the sorber, and it was removed in the NaF waste stream. As noted before,
Qne-fifth of the lower zone is exhausted per day; and there are two parallel
.éorbers alternately operating for 12 hr each. This results in an accumula - |
tion of decaying fission products or of decreasing heat sources in the
sorber, in the NaF waste tanks, and finally in the interim waste -storage’
facility. . 7 |

The heat generation rate for various process components was approximated
by determining the average heat generation rate during a specific time
period, and by assuming that this rate decayed as the total fission-product
heat rate decayed as shown in Figs. 2a and b. The accumulated heat |
generation rate could then be expressed as a rate characteristic of fission
products having an "average" age intermediaté between the oldest and the

most recently éorbed.

‘Movable-Bed Sorber

In the movableAbed sorber, the heat load can be approxxmated by

~assuming that the volatile fission products from the fluorinator accumulate

for 5 days and that those_flrst accunuleted will decey or cool as additional
accumulation occurs. A table can be prepared for accumulated heat genersa-
tion rate, derived from the residence time of fission products in the

sorber:

The NaF waste tanks accomulate NaF and fission products from the

two sorbers (lO days’ accumulation of fission products in one—day incre-

APFENDIX C. ESTIMATION CF DISIILLATION
RATE IN VACUUM STILL '

Here, calculations,arefgiren whereby the distillation rate of the

“vecuum still is estimated.r The configuration of the still is shown in -

Fig. 9 of the text. The calculational method used is a—modifiCation of

- the procedure for calculating the rate in molecular distillation as given
»by'Burrows.16 For our still, it is estimated that at lOOO C and ata °
- pressure of 1 mm of Hg, the dlstillation rates for LiF and BeF

o are,
respectively, 3. 32 x 10 3 and 2 02 x 10 =3 g sec :L,cm-2 ‘
For molecular distillation, & still is designed so that its condensing
surface is located quite close to its evaporating surfece, thereby
mlnlmizlng the transport distance for the Ve.por« If the separatlon
distance is small enough and if the pressure is low enough, a molecule
leaving the liquid surface’ has a very high probability of reaching the
condenser without colliding with another molecule. This is the essence

of molecular distillation. Our still cannot be described precisely as a

~ molecular still because its'operating pressure 1s oo high; however, the

pressure is low enough that conditions for molecular distillation are
approached. For this reason, the calculational methods of molecular
distillation, modified to apply to pressures slightly higher than those
for true molecular dlstillatlon, are used here to estimate the distillation
rate for our still. -

his treatment considers three events that can occur to the molecule in the

vapor space:

1.

Some molecules can reach the condenser without & collision; this

fraction is e“K; vhere K is a dimensionless factor depending upon

the distance between evaporator and condenser, the equilibrium

mean free path of the molecules, and the shape of the evaporatlng

surface.

The fraction of molecules that collide is (l _e® ),'and the
fraction of these molecules that reach the condenser is (1 - e”
approximately. :

From purely geometrical considerations, the probability of a

molecule's striking the condenser after many collisions, which

result in random motion, is a factor F, the ratio of condenser

- area to condenser area plus evaporator area. The fraction of.

these molecules that reach the condenser after many colllslons
is F(1 - eX)(1 - eX),

A more rigorous representation of Eg. (0-7) would include the activity

account for deviations from ideality. However, the activity coefficients
are not known for these salt_solutions, so for this study it will be assumed
that Eq. (C-7) gives a reasonably valid estimate of the distillation rate.

Since the still operates at constant volume, a material balance

requires that BeF and LiF distill at the same rate at which they enter
the still. The vapor composition is therefore sbout 69-31 mole % LiF -BeF,,
the same as it is in the stream entering the still. If the total pressure
in the vapor space of the still is kept at 1 mm Hg, the partial pressures

of LiF and BeF. are 0.69 and 0.31 mm Hg, respectively, assuming that there

APPENDIX D. FISSION-PRODUCT ACCUMULATION AND HEAT GENERATION
RATE IN LITHIUM FLUORIDE POOL IN VACUUM STILL

Nonvolatile:fission products accumulate in the'vacuum'still as the

LiF -BeF, fuel carrier and volatile fission products are distilled away.

2

‘The st1ll is initially charged with L £t° of mekeup (LiF, evacuated to &

pressure of 1 mm Hg or less and adjusted to a-temperature of about 1000° C

_ Fluorinated fuel salt, containing fission products, is allowed to flow
- continuously into the pool of LiF, and the still is operated so that the

rate of distlllation is exactly equal to the féed rate. There is no bottom | &
discharge, and the volume remains constant. KElly 8 work 25 showed that the
o distillate is decontaminated by a -factor of 100 to

1000 from rare ‘earths. Operation is continued at the above pressure and

temperature until one of two phenomena. forces termination: (1) Either the

solubility of fission products in the L ft3 of LiF is exceeded and trouble-
some precipitation occurs, or (2) the accumulated heat generation rate from

fission-product decay begins to tax the capacity of the cooling system.

When the distillation is terminated, the LiF—fission-product residue in the
still is dralned to 8 waste receiver end eventually'to permanent storage.

 The operating cycle is then repeated.

The aim of the follow1ng calculations is to determine the operating

 cycle for the still and the-limiting conditions for the design shown in

Fig. 9. Since one design criterion is to process the fuel streem with

;minimum out-of—reactor holdup, and since the solubility of the rare earths

in LiF at 1000 C is about 50 mole %, it is apparent that condition (2)

’*'above will be controlling. DecayAheat removal w1ll be a serlous prdblem |
-long before solubility 1imits ‘are approached. It has been determined that
:__the h-ft3 sti1l can operate contlnuously fér about 67. 4 days at a distilla-

's:tion rate of 15 ft3/day, processing fuel that has the heat generation

‘ 'characteristics shown in Figs. 2a and b of the text. The 31gnificance of

. - this number is that it represents the rate of 7Li discard to waste - 116 kg
‘every 67 li days. The heat. generation rate &t this time is 31 X 106 Btu/hr,

versus decay time represent gfoss values and hence do not exclude the
contributions of those fission products removed-by the reactor gas sparge,
by deposition on metal surfaces in the reactor éYstem, dr.by the fluorina-
tion step in chemical processing. Furthermore, the 15;ft3/day'deSign rate
is probably excessive for a 1000-Mw (electrical) MSER; the economic optimum
rate is perhaps nearer 12ft3/day. Also, no credit was taken for periodic
interruptions in processing due to the reactor's operating at less than
100% plant factor. All these factors tended to shorten the still operating
cycle and increase the discard cost. ' )

The calculations are arranged as follows: First, an analytical
expression is derived for the heaﬁ generation rate of fission products
in the etill as & function of elapsed time since discharge from the
reactor. Second, this equation is then used to evaluate the still design.

Analytical Expression'for Heat Generation Rate

When irradiated fuel salt is discharged from the fluorinator, it has
been out of the reactor about 38 hr. A cooling tank downstream from the
- fluorinator adds another 24 hr of holdup, so that the salt is about 62 hr
old vhen it reaches the still. The heat generation characteristics of
the salt during this period were calculated by assuming an infinitely
mixed system; these calculations are described in Appendix A, and the
results are shown graphically in Fig. A-l1. Continuous operation'is
assumed throughout the system, and, by the time the fuel reaches the
still, its heat generation (Fig. A-1) is about 4.45 x 10h Btu_hr'l'ft‘3.
The still is a sink for fission products that exhibit decay behavidr
like that shown in Fig. 2a and b. Initially at t = 62 hr = 2.58 days, |
the 4 ft3'of LiF in the still is fresh material having & zero heat geners-
tion rate, but this condition changes rapidly when the still is pﬁt on - '_
stream. Flow into the still is continuous;‘and the rate of heat generation
will rise until flow is stopped. The magnitude of this rate at any future
time T is therefore an integrated quantity over the accumulation period:
Tt = 2.58 days to T. To describe the behavior of the still during this

o
period, define the quantities

-Ev_aluation of Vacuum-Still Design

Two principal conditions had to be satisfied in the still design

(1) the evaporating surface had to be sufficient for obtaining the required
15 -ft% /day distillation rate, and (2) maximum heat transfer surface had to
be provided to minimize the'frequency'with which the still'is drained to

the waste tank. The choice_of dimensions was somewhat arbitrary; 2 tube-
sheet diameter of 2.5 ft was chosen because it gave an evsporating surface
that was sbout 2.5 times the calculated area,land &8 closely spaced arrange-
ment of 2.5-ft-long by 1/2-in.-diam tubes was used for high cooling-surface-

'~ to-volume ratio._'The'primary unknown operating condition is the length of

time that fission products can be accumulated before the integrated heat
generation taxes the capacity'of,the cooling system; an estimate of this

time is determined in_theifollouing calculations. The schematic diagram

in Fig. D D-3 depicts the still operation end summarizes calculated performance

and physical data.

The calculations which are described.'below indicate that the still

- can accumulate fission products for sbout 67.l4 days in 8 h-ft3 LiF pool

when the still is Operated continuously at e feed rate of 15 ft3/day. The
discard rate for LiF is therefqre 8 very small fraction of the processing
rate, being about'o.h%., As?mentioned;above, the heat generation rate

predicted by Eq. (D-8)-is prohably excessive because gross instead of net

fission-product data were used therefore this accumulation time can be

;treated as & lower limit. S

Applicable data are given on Fig. D-3.

o 'Heat Transfer Characteristics »

 

The lOOO °c temperature of the LiF pool in the still was chosen to
achieve adequate distillation rate and fission-product solubility. The

t pool transfers heat to the tube walls by natural convection, and this heat

is picked up on the outside of the tubes by NeK (22.3-77.7 mole % Na-K

eutectic) under forced convection.- The NaK coolant enters the still at

of 340°%C (612°F). Heat transfer characteristics of LiF were calculated by }

“using the Nusselt equation for natural convection, in conjunction with the

physical -property data given in. Appendix F. A Nusselt-type equation for
flow normal to banks of tubes was used for calculating the heat transfer
properties of the coolant. Since the total heat dissipation requirement

of the still was unknown (because fissionfproduct accumulation time wes
not known), the coolant heat trensfer coefficient was expressed as 8
function of the heat ‘generation rate. It was determined that the still
could dissipate about 31 x 106 Btu/hr for the Nak flow conditions shown

in Fig. D-3. The overall heat trensfer coefficient for maximm heat flux

is about 190 Btu hr -1 ft*e_QF l. From Fig. D-2, the time after ‘discharge

70 days. The fission-product accumulation time is 2.58 days less or 67.L

If it is assumed that the fluorination step is 99.7% efficient for uranium

slightly higher than this is satisfactory. If there are deviations from
ideal operation so that a higher-melting composition distills, the con -

APPENDIX E. DESIGN CALCULATIONS FOR WASTE-STORAGE SYSTEM

Separate storage iSprorided for fuel and fertile stream wasﬁes as
fluorides in;underground tanks designed for bulk accumulation over & 30-
year period. Waste'msnsgementlin the post-30ayear period was not con-
sidered in this study. However, as mentioned in the text (see Table 2), |
it will probably be desirable to reprocess the fertile-stream waste, vhich |
is only mildly radioactive, at some future time for recovery of thorium,
lithium, end uranium values. About 116 kg of 33U will be present. Fission
products,.sepsrated‘in this recovery, could be stored longer, depending on
the activity. f o S - | |

" In the fuel-stream waste, the only significant value, other than the

‘possible future value of 1nd1v1dual-fis51on products, is 7Li. However, as
~expleined below; it is necessary to add a mixture of NEF-KF to this waste
- to facilitate heat transfer. Since these compounds are chemically similer

to LiF, recovery of the 11thium is difficult. In any event, at the end of
the 30 -year period, the desirability of recovery would have to be analyzed

~in light of the prevailing costs.-

Two basic problems must be solved in de51gning the waste storage
system: (1) the 1ntegrated rate of heat generation by fiSSionfproduct

_decay'mnst be determined, and (2), using the results of (l), the most

economic design for the prevailing conditions must be found. The heat
generation rate is computed from the'fissionfproduct decay behavior

-exhibited in Figs. 2a and b (see text), and the results are shown in

Figs. E-1 and.EAE. A preV1ous study by Carter and.Ruchlu examined &

similar waste—storage problem, and, in ‘accord w1th their" recommendation :

i_ffor_economic wvaste managoment, bulk storage in large, heat-exchanger ‘tanks

: is'adopted'for our wastes. Conceptual designs of the waste facilities are

shown on ‘Dwgs. 58080 D and 58081 C in Appendix.F , -
over the 30-year period, 78h ft3 of fuel-stream waste are collected.

b”.This volume includes 520 ft3 of LiF-fissionfproduct mixture drained from
 the processing cell, plus 28k £t3 of NeF XF diluent. ‘The storage tenk 1is
'r;fl6 £t in diameter and 6. 33 ft hlgh. The corresponding volume of fertile-
‘stream waste is 1783 ft3 this is stored in a tank 13 5 ft in diameter by
. 13.5 ft high '

Most of the following calculations are conéerned’with the design of
the waste tank for fuel-stream effluent because the most difficult design
problems occur for this waste. After the decay characteristics of the
fission products and integrated heat generation rate are determined, the
calculations examine, in the following drder, the basic features of tank
design, maximum allowable heat generatlon rate, volume of diluent, waste-
tank de51gn, and the underground storage fa01llty. Once these calculations:

are made, computations for the fertile-stream waste are almost incidental.
Fuel Stream Waste System

Decay Characteristics of the Fission Prodﬁcts

The initial problem in designing the waste tank is to determine the
decay in terms of the time-related characteristics of the salt being added.
to the tank. That is to say, the still bottoms, which represent an accumule -
tion of fission prdducts having ages in the range 2.58 to TO days, generate
heat at a rate characteristic of fission products having an "average" age
somevhere between these values. The time -related behavior of the integrated,
specific heat generation rate is shown in Fig. 11 of the text for the case
of no inert salt dilution. The graph covers a S-yearfcollection.period.of
L-£t3 batches every 67.4 days. The initial point on the graph begins at
about 140 days; this is the accumulated time in the processing plant with a
reference time of zero taken as the day the fuel is discharged from the
reactor. An in-cell delay period of 67.4 days after removal from the still
is included in this time to pefmit some initial cooling before draining‘to
the underground tank. -

The decay curves of Figs. 2a and b can be used to determine the decay
behavior when this "average" age has been found. The volume of fuel salt

from which f15510n products have accumulated is:

15 £t3/dsy x 67.h days = 1011 ft3 :
It was determined in Appendix D that the heat generﬁtion rate at age equal’
to T0 days out of the reactor is 31 x 106 Btu/hr. Therefore on the basis
of unit volume of core salt the average heat generation rate is:

If t lies in the range 2 to 10 days, theﬁ\its value can be found directly
from Eq. (E-4) by utilizing k = 6. 69 x 10” and n = 0.43 from Eq. (E-5).
However, if tavg is in the range 10 to 20 days, Eq. (E-4t) contains a second |
term in the numerator involving the constants k = 9.686 X 10_ and n = 0.59
of Eq. (EA6) Similarly for t ave in the range 20 to 100 days, the numerator
of Eq. (E-4) conteins a third temm involving the constants of Eq. (E-T).

The solution is easily determined by trial, ‘and for this case the proper

form of Eq. (E-4) contains the constants k and n from Egs. (E-5) and (E-6):

Integrated Heat Generation in Waste Tank

When the vacuum still is taken off stream and drained, its h-ft3
volume is generating heat at 31 x 106 Btu/hr, but this rate is decreasing
in & manner characteristic of 11.6-day-0ld fission products, as shown on
Fig. 2b. At this point, the change in rate is rather rapid, indicating
that a short delay time in the cell before draining to underground storage .
will sppreciably alleviate design requirements for the large tank.
Installation of a second h-£t3
is a convenient way of prov1d1ng a 67 4 day holdup, during this time the

vessel quite similar to the vacuum still

heat generation rate decreases by a factor of sbout L. 5.

A decay curve was calculated for a typical batch of still residue by
assuming that the curve was parallel to the decay curve of Fig. 2b for MSER
fission products after 11.6 days. The 67.4-day in-cell delay mekes the

accumulated time from reactor discharge to underground storage equal to
 

 

- 103 -

- '137.4 days; at this time the heat generation ,rate_of'the L-£t3 vatch is
6.8 x 106 Btu/hr. The curves of Fig. E-l are plotted to show the thermal
history of the underground waste tank\over a 5-year collection period
during which 27 batches are”added'-also the decay in the post-5-year
collection'period is shown. The curve with positive slope represents the
buildup of heat generation rate from all batches accumulated up to the
indicated time. This_curve is actually a stepped curve, but for convenience
it has been drawn smooth through-the maximum point of each step. The waste
tank is designed for 30 yearsf collection, and the accumulated heat genera-
tion at this time can be obtained with little error by extrapolating the
positive-leped curve of Fig. E-1. | | 7

- Figure E-2 has been included to show the integrated heat generation
A rate in the underground waste tank when the still residue is drained into
the tenk immediastely upon completion of the distillation cycle.

Figures E-l.and E-E,represent an upper limit for fissionfproduct heat

~ generation. As‘pointedrout earlier in this report, the values are for‘
- gross fission-product decay, which includes nuclides that'have‘been removed
prior to vacuum distillation. Also the curves were calculated for &
reactor plant factor of 100%. | |

Basic Features of Tenk Design -

A previous study 1h showed that bulk storage in large tanks is +the most
economical management for fluoride wastes. A 30-year period was chosen
because it coincided: with the amortization period of the reactor plant, and
a single tank 1s sufficient because the overall waste volume is small. For
economy and reliability, cooling by forced air draft was adopted, and an
‘upper limit of 60 ft/sec was assigned to the velocity  Waste temperature
'_'1n the tank is not to- exceed 750 C S S

. Maximum Allowable Heat Generation Bate

Under the above ground rules it is apparent that there is an upper
limit that can be tolerated for the volumetric heat production rate, and

_' that the waste will have to be diluted to wet sufficlent cooling surface.
~ In 30 years at 80% reactor,plant factor there will be 520 ft3 of radioactive

5. Cooling by netural air convection.

It was estimated that the 1ntegrated_heat generation rate at the end of the

temperature is allowed“to'beiasrnigh as 9009F, this heat can be dissipated
