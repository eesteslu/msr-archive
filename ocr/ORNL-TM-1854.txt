MATERIALS DEVEIOPMENT FOR MOLTEN-SALT BREEDER REACTORS
H. E. McCoy, Jr., and J. R. Weir, Jr.

- ABSTRACT

We have described the materials development program
that we feel necessary to ensure the successful construction -
and operation of a molten-salt breeder reactor, The pro-
posed reactor is a two-region system utilizing a uranium-
bearing fluoride fuel salt and a thorium-bearing fluoride
blanket salt. A third lower melting fluoride salt will be
used as a coolant for transferring the heat from the fuel

and blanket salts to the supercritical steam. The primary

structural materials are graphite and modified Hastelloy N,
The individual fuel cells will be constructed of graphite

tubes. These tubes must withstand neutron doses of the order

of 1072 neutrons/cm and must have very low permeability: to

gases (because of 137Xe entrapment) and fused salts. These

requirements mean that we need a graphite that is slightly

. better than any currently available. We have described in

detail what graphites are available and their respective
properties. A line of action for obtaining improved grades
of graphite is proposed along with a test program for
evaluating these new products.

Modified Hastelloy N will be used in all parts of the
system.except the reactor core. Since standard Hastelloy N
is embrittled at elevated temperatures by neutron irradiation,

‘it has been necessary to modify the composition of the alloy

with a small addition of titanium., The program necessary for
fully developing this modified alloy as an. engineering material
is described in detall ; \ ,

An integral part of the proposed system is a JOlnt between
the tubular graphite fuel channels and the modified Hastelloy N.

‘Brazing alloys have been develoPed specifically for this job
“and a reasonable design for the joint has been made. The

1ntegr1ty of the goint must be demonstrated by engineering

_tests.

. Several areas requlre the development of suitable inspec-
tion techniques. These techniques are further complicated by

the fact that they must be adaptable to remote 1nspection

inside the Ieactor cell

_ Although numerous problems exist which will require Turther
development, none of these appear insolvable. Hence, we feel
that the materials development program can proceed at a rate
consistent with that proposed for the Molten-Salt Breeder Reactor.

INTRODUCTION

The proposed molten-salt‘breeder'reactorsllwiiljrequire some advances
in materiais technology. However, the'construction and operatioh of the
_Mbiten-Salt Reactor Experiment have given us iovaluable iasight concerning
what advances are necessary. We feel that we can make these advances on a
time schedule that is consistent with that pr0posed for the Mblten-Salt
. Breeder Reactor A

From & materials standpoint, the reactor 1s easily divided into two
sections: (l) the core and (2) the reactor veseelrand associated piping.
The requirements of the material for use within the core are (1) good
moderation, (2) low neutron absorption, (3) compatibility with the molten
salt~Hastelloy N system, (4) low permea.bility to both salt and fiseion ga.ses,
(5) fabricable into tubular shapes, (6) capable of being jolned to the rest
- of the system, and (7) capable of maintaining all the above. properties after

A

accumulated neutron doses of 1023 neutrons/cm . Graphite 1s the preferred
material for the core, and the Grade CGB graphite used in the MSRE satis-
fies most of the stated requirements. The main additional requirements.

Nh

®

are that we develop the technology for producing tubular shapes of a com-
parable material with slightly improved gas permeability and then demon—
strate that this material will retain its integrity to neutron doses of

1023 neutrons/cm®. Tubes of the desired quality can be produced in the

near future. .Available data on the radiation damage of graphite to doses'
of 2 to 3 X 1022 neutrons/cm? indicate that the material is capable-of the
anticipated doses. , : o

| The rest of the system — the core vessel, heataexchahgers, and piping -
- will see & considerably lower neutron flux. The requiremeats of.a‘material
~ for this application include (1) resistance to corrosion by fluoride salts,
(2) compatibility with'the core material (3) capable of(being fabricated
into complicated shapes by conventional processes such as rolling, forging,
and welding, (4) good mechanical strength and ductility at temperatures over
the expected service range of lOO to 1300°F, and (5) capable of maintaining-

“reasonable strength and ductility after eXposure to a neutron environment.

Hastelloy N satlsfies most of these requirements This alloy was developed

- at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory specifically for. use in molten-salt

lsystems.' HOWever, our experlences w1th this alloy in the MSRE indicate

~that 1t has at least two disadvsntages: 8 propensity_forxweld cracking

and severe reduction of high-temperature ductility after irradiation. The
- first problem can be solved by using vacuum-melted material, but slight

changes in the alloy comp051tion will be necessary to minimize the radia-
tion damage problem, We have found that a slightly modified alloy con- -
taining O 5wt % Ti has good weldability and reasonable resistance to
radiation damsge - _

 This report presents the present stste of knowledge of these two

'materials, graphite and Hastelloy'N, as they affect an MSBR. The first

section discusses Hastelloy N and the second discusses graphlte The
final section briefly presents the program requlred to extend the develOp-
ment of these materials to_s stage where they may be used in the MSBER
Wnilke considerable development and testing must be accomplished to pro-

vide the aSSured.performance'necessary for a resctor_system, it appears

that adequate materials can'be'obtsined for a molten-salt breeder reactor.
STATUS OF THE DEVELOFMENT OF HASTELLOY N
JGeneral\PrOperties

'3 During the early stages of the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Program,

'.msny metals and’ alloys were: screened to determine their re81stance to.

';,f'molten fluorides. Primsrlly on' the. basis of these reSults, ‘the nickel—'

'r,molybdenum system was selected as the most: promising for additlonal study.

A molybdenum concentration range of 15 to 20% was selected since this

Vylelded s1ngle-phase alloys with their inherent metallurgical stability

 The Hastelloy N alloy reSulted from this program and was used for the MSRE.

has been controlled to preclude aging embrittlement. The aluminum, -
titanium, and carbon contents are limited to minimize severe fabrication
and corrosion problems, and the boron content is limited to prevent weld
,cracking. Iron is included to allow more choice of starting materials
for melting. The extreme examples of permissible combinations of elements
'allowed by the chemistry specification were studied, and in no case did.
any undesirable brittle phases develop. Carbides of the form Mé305 and
M¢C exist in the alloy and are stable to at least 1800°F.

The MSRE was constructed using conventional practices (comparable to
those used for a stainless steel system) and from material obtained from
commercial vendors. The major materials problem encountered was one of

weld cracking, which was eventually overcome by slight changes in melting

Physical Properties

Several phy51cal properties of Hastelloy N are llsted in Table 2.
Specific heat, electrical re51stiv1ty, and thermal conductiv1ty data all

»show inflections with respect to temperature at l200°F This is thought

to be due to an order-disorder reaction, however, no changes in mechanical

v
pr0pert1es are detectable as a result of this reaction. -

Mechanical Properties

The composition and the fabrication procedure for Hastelloy N have been

optimized with resPect to. resistance to salt corrosion, ox1dation resistance,

 and freedom from embrittling aging reactions. The strength of the alloy

is greater than the austenltic stainless steels and comparable with the
stronger alloys of the "Hastelloy type." |
‘Design data for this alloy were established by performing mechanical

prOperty tests on experimental heats of commercial size. Data from this

study were reviewed by the. ASME Boller and Pressure Vessel Code Committee
and Code approval wa.s obtained under Case 1315 for Unfired Pressure Vessel

construction and Case 1345 for Nuclear Vessel constructlon.l The recognized

-~ allowable stresses are tabulated 1n Table 3. The" commercial heats used
for MSRE construction exhibited strengths equal to or greater than the
- experimental heats...

Effects of Irradiation.

Although it has been shown thattHastelloy N'has suitebie:properties
for long-time use at high temperatures, a deterioration of high*temperature
properties occurs in a hlgh neutron-radiation field 5 we have found
that Hastelloy'N is susceptible to a type of high—temperature dirradiation
damage that reduces the creep—rupture life and the rupture ductillty
Data from 1n-reactor creep-rupture tests run on a. heat of MSRE material
are_presented in Fig. 1l. The rupture life has been reduced by a factor |
of 10 and the rupture ductility to strains of 1 to 3%. There is,.however,
an inuicatiOn that the radistion effect becomes less as the'strese'levels

are reduced.

. The amount of damage present is a function of the thermal flux and is

| essentially independent of fast flux.  This supports the hypothesis that

the damage is due to the thermal neutrons with the 108 transmutation to
lithium and helium thought to be the most probable reaction. The helium

| __collects in,the grain boundaries and promotes the formation of intergranu-

lar cracks ThlS type of irradiation damage has been found to be quite

"'general for iron- and nickel—base structural alloys.

Helium.may be formed in Hastelloy'N from two sources. - The normal

alloys contain 30 to 100 ppm. B, and, when exposed to thermal neutrons,

the transmutation of the 10B Just discussed is by far the predominant
source of helium A second source is the (n,q) reactions of fast neutrons

with nickel molybdenum, and iron. Thise source of helium predominates

after all the 10B has been transmuted (requiring a thermal dose of

approximately 1021 neutrons/cmz) or in materials Where the 108 content 1s

- extremely low.

In the reference MSBR there is no- stressed metal in the core and the

3Hastelloy'N is shielded from the core by the breeder blanket Most of the

neutrons reaching the metal will originate as delayed neutrons that are
born with t00 low an energy level to produce the fast neutron reactions.\-
Therefore, the best way to reduce the amount of helium in the metal is to

reduce the boron content
. The main source of boron in commercial alloys is the melting crucible,

and we have found that with reasonable care ‘commercial heats can be prepared'

»,;with boron in the range L—5 ppm. However, the proPerties of irradiated
. metal of this low boron content are no better than ‘those of metal contalning

ﬁ750 ppm B 1ndicating that the threshold helium levels necessary for damage

can ‘be. produced in metal containing below 1 ppm- B. Hence, it appears that

ffreducing the boron level alone is not an adequate solution to the prdblem.

We have found that the resistance of Hastelloy N to irradiation

o damage can be improved by slight changes in chemical composition. A

r*reduction in the molybdenum content seems desirable to prevent the forma-

tion of mass1ve MSC in the alloy. Flgure 12 shows the 31mpler micro-

ldd;structure of the a110y containing 12% Mb Further increases in the

Corrosion by Molten Fluoride Salts

A unique feature of the molten-salt\type reactors_ie'the_circuiation
of molten salts both as the fuel and the coolant media. The Salts_being
" used are mixtures of metal fluorides. Essentially no experience is |
available from‘indnstry on handling such salt mixtures at the proposed
temperatures,‘tut much information has been produced at ORNL. B o
Studies on molten fluoride mixtures for reactor applieatione began . .
in(the early 1950's and gave-prinafy consideration to the compatibility
of these salt mixtures with stiucturel materials. In the intervening
15 years, an extensive corrosion program has been conducted at,ORNLrwith"
several families of fluoride mixtures using‘both commercial and develop-
mental high-temperature alloys.”™ 15 As a consequence, the corrosion - :

of development Furthermore, container materials are. available that have

ghown extremely low corrosion rates in fluoride mixtures at temperatures

_ considerably above the 1000 to 1300 F range proposed for the MSER.

- Unlike more conventional oxidi21ng media, ‘the . products of oxidation
of metals by molten;fluorides tend to be completely,soluble in the cor-

Loop Studies

The origlnal studies that serve as a base for the MSBR corrOS1on
studies were conducted at ORNL a8 part of the Aircraft Nuclear PrOpulsion
Project 713 Work on this project wag aimed at a 1500°F maximum tempera-

v'ture. Nickel alloys were shcwn to be the most promising for containing
the fluorides however, strength considerations restricted the candidate
-materials to the commercial nickelvchromium group,_with Inconel 600

‘receiving the most attention. These‘alloys’incurred corroSion by selective

oxidation of chromium through trace impurities and by mass transfer of

chromium through a redox reactionrinvolv1ng UF4.' Corrosion‘was in the

form of subsurface vbids'withﬁthe-depth'prop0rtionalrto the test time

and temperature.

 
 

 

 

Using information gained in corrosion testing of the commercial |
alloys and from_fundamental,interpretations ofthe.corrosionprocess, an .
alloy was developed at ORNL to provide improved coerSion resistance as
- well as-acceptable mechanical:prOperties; The alloy system used as the,-
basis for this'deveIOpment wasrcomposed_ofrnickel with a_prinary_strengthe
ening addition of 15 to 20%-Mb.. Evaluations of other'strengthening addi-

- tions culminated in the selection of an alloy containing 16% Mo, 7% Cr,
and 4% Fe (INOR-8, now Hastelloy N). | . S

'The corrosion testing program for Hastelloy N involved three sequential
phases., In the first phase, the corrosion properties of 13 fluoride salt
mixtures were compared in Hastelloy N thermal-convection loops operated
for 1000 hr. Specific salt mixtures, whose compositions are_listedhin
Table 4, were selected_to_provide an evaluation of (1) the corrosion
properties of beryllium-bearing fuels, (2) the corrosion properties of
beryllium-fluoride mixtures containing large quantities of thorium, and
(3) the corrosion properties of nonfuel-bearing fluoride cooclant salts.
The second phase of testing, which again used thermal-oonvection 1o0ps,
involved more extensive investigations for longer time periods and at
two teaperature levels. The third phase of the'testing was conducted'in
 forced-circulation loops at flow rates and temperature conditions simu- '
lating those of an operating reactor system. These 100ps Operated with
maximum fuel-salt temperatures of 1250 to 1500°F, ma.ximum coolant salt
temperatures of 1050 to 1200°F, and all with approximately 200°F tempera-
- ture drOps. A total of 49 thermal loops and 15 forced-circulation loops
- were operated during these phases of the. program | o |
Essentially no attack or deposition was found with any of the
- fluorides in Hastelloy'N lOOpS in the phase-I studies. The max1mum‘ |
attack found after 8760 hr in the phase-II tests was a 1imited surface 7
‘roughening and pitting to a depth of 1/2 mil Attack in most cases was
accompanied by a thin surface 1ayer. ‘The typical appearance of a hot-
leg surface is shown in Fig. l4 Nb deposit or other evidence of mass
transfer wvag found in any of the cold legs | A -

In the third phase of the _progranm, employing forced—convection lOOpS,
tubular inserts in the heated sections of some of the 100ps provided infor-
mation about the weight losses occurring during the tests. 8Salt samples

;;~MSRE 0perating ExperiEHCE ;3{:4ff;v

The MSRE initially underwent a series of zero- and low-power tests.

, sThe chemical analyses of the MSRE fuel and coolant salts showed very little
”-change, indicating a 1ow corrosion rate ‘of the Hastelloy N-and negligible
_Ttransfer of impurities from the graphite to the salt, This was substanti-

ated by the examination of graphite and metal sPecimens after the initial
tests, ' N . » '

The full-power operation of the reactor began in March 1965 The
first group of metal and graphite surveillance Specimens was removed in

July 1966 after eXposure to the reactor core environment for 7612 Mwhr

_ which included a - thermal exposure of 4800 hr at 1200°F The peak thermal

dose was 1.3 X 1020 neutrons/cm and the peak fast dose >l 2 Mev was

3 x 10%° neutrons/cm The concentration of chromiwn in the fuel salt
increased from an initial value of 37 to 48 ppm where 1t remained fairly
steady during the 7612 MWhr run The iron and nickel concentrations
remained constant at values of lO and l ppm, respectively Visual exam-
ination indicated the metal and graphite specimens to be in ‘excellent
condition. Machining marks were quite visible on the graphite gpecimens,
Several of the graphite and metal specimens were given to the Reactor
Chemistry Division for analysis with respect to fission product content 17
The graphite specimens have heen stored and mechanical property tests will

mhe run in the near future.i The Hastelloy N specimens were examined metal-

specimens for ccmparison purposes were exposed to MSRE—type fuel salt and

from the MSRE had propertieS"rery'similar'tO“those observed for specimens

- irradiated to comparable doses in the ORR.

The most 1mportant question to be answered concerning these data is

how - they apply to the operation of the MSRE

The surveillance specimens were exposed to a thermal dose of

1.3 x 1020 neutrons/cm ~ (The MSRE vessel will reach this dose after
about 150,000 MWhr of operation.) ‘This burned out about 30% of the 10B
~and produced a helium content of about 107 5 atom fractlon 1n both heats.

The high- temperature tensile and creep-rupture properties are exactly what

- we would expect for this dose Our work indleates a saturation in the
| degree of radiation damage at a helium atom fraction of about 10'5 and we

feel that the properties of the material will not deteriorate further

| The.lowetemperature_ductility reduotionmwas not expected. It is thought

tO'be_a‘result'of graineboundary‘precipitates forming“due to the long
thermal exposure. Irradlation playa some role in this process that is yet
undefined The low-temperature properties are not "brittle“ by any stan-
dards, but will be monitored closely when future sets of surveillance
speC1mens are removed. L -' ' o . |

The MSRE has since operated for a total of approximately 32,500 Mwhr.

- The chromium content of the salt has been somewhat higher during this run
at approximately 60 ppm we removed a group of surveillanoe speoimens |
,(graphite and Hastelloy N) for study about May 15, 1967. The Hastelloy N

VOxidation Resistance'h .

The ox1dation resistance of nickel-molybdenum alloys depends on the

.l_rservice temperature, the temperature cycle, the molybdenum content - and
“'dthe chromium content, . The ox1dat10n rate of the binary nickel-molybdenum
--alloy passes through a max1mum for the alloy containing 15% Mo, and the
'-scale formed by the ox1dat10n is- N1M004 and NiO. Upon thermal cycling

 
 

 

32

from above 1400°F to below 660°F;_the'N1M004'undergoes a phase transfor-
mation that causes the protective scale on the oxidized metal to spall.
Subsequent temperature cycles then result in an accelerated oxidation
rate. Similarly, the oxidation rete of nickel-molybdemum alloys contein-
ing chromium passes through a maximum as the chromium content of the
alloys is increased from 2 to 6% Cr. ‘- Alloys containlng more ‘than 6% Cr
are insensitive to thermal cycling and to the molybdenum content because
B the oxide scale is predomlnantly stable Cr203 An abrupt ‘decrease (by a
factor of about 40) in the oxldation rate at 1800°F is dbserved when the
chromium content is increased from 5.9 to 6.2%. | - |

The oxidation resistance of Hastelloy N is excellént#‘and'centinuous"
~ operation at temperatures up to 1800°F is feasible. Intermittent use at
- temperatures as high as 1900°F could be tblerefed.'-For'temperetures;up'__
to 1200°F, theVOxidatiOn'rete is not measurable; it'is*essentielly zero
after 1000 br of exposure in static air; as well as in nitrogen containing
small quantities of air (thefMSRE'cell environment). It is estimated
that oxidation of 0.001 to 0.002 in. would occur in 100,000 hr ef opera-
tion at 1200°F. The effect of temperature on the oxidation rate of ‘the
alloy is shown in.Fig 21. '

Resistance to Nitriding

 

Hastelloy N does not-react-noticeably with nitrogen at temperatures
up to 2200°F in the absence of irradiation. 'waerer, in a neutron
environment, the nitrogen is dissociated'and same shalloW‘surface-reac-“
tion (a few mils) is encountered. Although only limited data are avail-
able, there appears to be a considerable variation in the depth of such |
layers with various lots of material. While such layers are not thick
- enough in themselves to affect the strength of the proposed cemponents, -
they are brittle and crack eas1ly, 50 that they could possibly act as

stress risers.

 

Compatibility'with Superheated Steam
In parts of the system Hastelloy N will be exposed to'snpercritical"'

steam having & maximum temperature of 1050°F and.a pressure of 3800 psi.

failure in boiling water and in superheated steam systems'has_been cbserved
for the austenitic stainlese steels in several nuclear systems;l?’zo_ The
resistance of high-nickel alloys'to this type of attack has also been
established and it seems reasonable that our system should utilize such an
alloy. 19, 20

, Hastelloy N has been included in steam-metal compatibility programs
 at BNWL, 21522 gn3 some of the results of these studies are sumarized in
Table 8. Hastelloy N exhibited much better resistance to corrosion by
steam than type 304L stainless steel. It also compared very favorably
with the other nickel-base alloys that were included in these evaluation
programs (e.g., Hastelloy X, Inconel 600, and Incoloy 800). Although the
depth of attack varied slightly with steam pressure and oxygen content, a
.rather pessimistic value for the corr081on rate is about 0. l mil attack
in 2400 hr. Assuming a linear rate of attack, which again 1s on the pessi-
mistic slde, the depth of attack in 20 years would be about 7 mils.
Assuming the more realistic parabolic behavior, the expected depth of
attack would be only 0.8 mil. Either of these values is quite acceptable |
and we feel that Hastelloy N is a very attractive material for use in the

steam circuit

Fabrication of Hastelloy N Systems and Components

The fact that Hastelloy N is a'material_from which a complicated
reactor system may be constructed has been demonstrated by the'successfnl
construction and operation of the MSRE. Evidence of its general recog-
nition by industry is demonstrated by its acceptance and.approval by the
ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, |

" Raw Material Fabrication

Hastelloy N has proven to be readily fabricable into the many raw
material forms (pipe, tube, plate,'bar, castings,etc.)‘required in the
fabrication of a compdex engineering system such as a nuclearreactor.
Fabrication of the various rew material items required for the MSRE was
by normal commercial sonrces Forming techniques'deveIOPed'for austen- .
itic stainless steels can usually be used for Hastelloy N with a small
increase in temperature.

Melting and casting is carried out by using conventional practices
for nickel and its alloys. Ingots for the MSRE were prepared by both
air- and vacuun induction or consumable arc melting Individual.melts up
to 10,000 1b and a total quantity of almost 200,000 1b were produced

| Castings have been made in molds of water-cooled copper, graphite, rammed ,

magnesia, cast iron, and sand. While castings are considerably weaker
than wrought metal at room temperature, they are slightly stronger at
MSBR.operating temperatures. It is easier to control the chemical anal-
ysis by vacuum melting and the metal has better mechanical properties
and fabricability. Vacuum melting has become & common commercial'practice
during the last few years, and this melting practice will probably be used
in.preference to air melting in the future for nuclear grade materials

In making the many different forms and sizes of material required
during the developnent and construction of the MSRE, Hastelloy N was fab-
ricated using the normal technigues for nickel-base alloys. The initial

fabrication or'breaking down of the ingots was accomplished by forging.
or extrusion. Temperatures varied from 1825 to 2250°F. - Secondary fabri-

_cation was accomplished hot and—coid; Acceptable techniques included
rolling, swaging, tube reducing, and drawing. The alloy work_hardensr

| when‘fabricated cold, but reductions in area of up to'50% are possible
7between anneals.. Temperatures of 2100 to 2200°F are used for hot rolling
“with reductions of about -10% per pass. L
~_ The standard finished annealing temperature for this alloy is 2150°F
~All material for the MSRE was annealed after forming or working. After
lfinal fabrication, all material was. stress relieved at 1600°F. For any
‘heat treatment the'cooling;rate to 600°F was limited to 400°F per hour
per inch of thickness. The slow cooling'helped to impart dimensional
stability and improved the ductility in the 1400 to 1800° F range.
A necessary adgunct of fabrication is an inspection to demonstrate

the acceptance of the product - Products fabricated from Hastelloy N
may be inspected With the same nondestructive testing procedures used

for other high-nickel alloys or austenitic stainless steels Tubing and
pipe received for the MSRE'were inspected using 1iquid penetrants, eddy

'currents, and ultrasonic techniques.
Weldingland Brazing of Hastelloy N

Extensive experienceuith-ﬂastelloy N has shown-that it exhibits
relatively good weldability. mhe MSREtcontains literaily'hundreds of
satisfactory tungsten-arc welds in varied section sizes. The welds were
- made using procedures developed at ORNL for nuclear quality applications
The subsequent inSpection of these welds showed that they met the very
tight 'ORNL requirements ' '

| Hastelloy N has also been shown to be readily brazeable. Good
:_wetting and flow have been demonstrated using commerCially available
brazing alloys and conventional brazing techniques.; o

During the course of the investigation of the weldability of
: Hastelloy N} welding prdblems were encountered _ Hot cracking of the type.
’occasionally encountered in welding high nickel alloys was sometimes
iobserved in heavily restrained JOints both in experimental heats and in

';'later commercial heats. In some of these unacceptable heats, the cause -
7of cracking was established as high boron content, however,'certain lower

boron heats were stil1l crack-sensitive for unknown reasons Although the

exact cause of the trouble;was never,established,.indications‘were that

 
 

38

it was associated with the proprietary melting practice used by the manu-
factnrer;. The impurity specifications were relaxed slightly, the melting
practice was revised, and weldable heats were produced. ' :

Although these changes upgraded the quality of the commercial pro-
ducts they did not assure the complete elimination of the propensity
toward cracking. A crack test was conceived and used &s the basis for
segregating unsatisfactory heats.”” Since the effects'of processing vari-
ables and impurity levels on welding were not determined' the‘weldabilr'
ity of a particular heat had to be determined by a test weld. Conse-—
quently, metallurgical studies aimed at understanding the basic reasons
for cracking and-eventually reaching'a more permanent solution were ini-
tiated. Cracking was shown to be essociated-with'the segregetionof
alloﬁng elements in the heat-affected zone of Hastelloy N weldments. 23
Figure 22 shows the microstructural changes that can occur'ée a result
of welding; microprobe analyses of these samples showed that the brittle
eutectic-type structure had a markedly different composition from that
of the matrix. ' - - _

To date, the gas tungsten-arc welding process is the only technique
that haS'been used for the construction of reactors'of this naterial |
The MSRE experience has proven the applicability of this process " The
weld filler metal used for Joining Hsstelloy N has been of the same
basic composition as the wrought product.

The room-temperature mechanical properties of Hestelloy N'weldments.
have been extensively investigated. In the course of qualifying welding
procedures for this alloy in accordance with the ASME Boiler and Pressure
Vessel Code, numerous bend and tenS1le tests were conducted The results
readily satisfied the Code requirements However, as was expected the
ductilities of the welds were not as good as those obtained for the base :
metal. Elevated-temperature studies of welds24,25 showed that_theychadr

Remote Joining

‘Molten- salt reactors have: the characteristic that the fuel circulates
through much of the external piping system \ During operatlon, residual
activity is 1mparted to the walls, and during drainlng some fuel always
remains either in the crevices or by sticking to the wall. The resulting
radioact1v1ty requires that remote maintenance procedures be used, and

they include remote Joining

Remote Welding

While'many'remote'joining methods'have been-developed for the nuclear:
industry,they'were_alwayS”for'special-applicatiOns such as replacing the
seal weld on a vessel, —or'making-a closure weld for'a'capsule or a fuel
element, %° Commerc1al equlpment is not generally available for such
aIgﬂications.. The nearest approaches to developed remote maintenance
systems for a large reactor were one designed and partially developed by
Westinghouse Electric Corporation, Atomic Power Departmentjrfor use with
the proposed Pennsylvania Advanced Reactor,30 and one at Atomics

International for use with'aflarge sodium graphite reactor.3! However,

these projects were terminated_before'the developed techniques could be

demonstrated. ':Includediwere-teChniqnes for plugging heat exchanger tubes
and for butt welding of pressure Piping. |

The practicality of remote operations has been- improved by the '
recent rapid advances in the automatic welding field aimed at the nuclear
and aerospace 1ndustr1es, an excellent example of an automated machlne is
the one developed for welding the HFIR fuel elements. The only function

“of the operator is to pos1tion the torch and o press the start button;

'both of these operations could also be done automatically 1f de51rable.

Brazing and Mechanical Joints

 

 Studies on remote Joining,hsve also included brszing and'meohsnical

joining techniques. Standard ring joint flanges were used at high pres-
sures but lower temperatures in the Homogeneous Reactor Expériment.; |
Freeze flanges are used to join the major pieces of equipment:in the'
MSRE. Similar developments have been made for other reactors and for
fuel reprocessing plants. in all cases the jolnts were developed for.
use in smaller pipes than are being proposed for the MSBR. The principal

deterrent to the use of mechanical joints is the dlfficulty in repeatedly
| assuring a seal, particularly in high-temperature cyclic service.
| - Equipment was developed and tested for remotely cutting and bra21ng

the drain line and the salt piping in the drain tank cell of the.MSRE.
The piping is standard 1 1/2-in. sched-40 pipe. These joints were .
cafefuiiy inspected _snd ﬁere determined to be of high qus.lity. '

Remote Inspection

 

A.necessary accompaniment of remote welding must be a remote inspec-__‘

tion. Less development has been done on inspection than on weldlng
Sufficient work has been done at ORNL to show that such operations are |
feasible and the required techniques should be possible with a_limited B
development program. | |

developed and used for the remote measurement of the wall thickness of

STATUS OF. Dm_aomm oF VGRAPHITE

In the proposed MSBR, graphite is used in the core as & pipe mate-

‘rial for separating the fuel and blanket salts and also for moderator

blocks around the tubes The former is the more critical use. The
graphite in the tubes must have low permeability to salt and must be free
from flaws that would permit appreC1able seepage of- salt between the

 fuel and blanket streams. A,value for the permeability to gases has not

been specified yet but a very low one is de51rable to minimize the rate

of diffusion of xenon- into thefgraphite and thereby minimize the loss of
neutrons to +>%Xe. - Although high strength is desirable, 1t need not be

‘higher than has already been obtained readily Techniques sre required
- for joining graphite to graphite and graphite to metals. Finally the

graphite in the MSEBR will be irradiated to a dose as high as

2 % 1032 neutrons/cm (E >'0 18 Mev) per year and the tubes must perform -

satisfactorily at this irradiation level for at least three and poss1b1y:
five years to have g practical power reactor

Graphites have been used for many years as. the moderator in a

,.variety of power and pdutonium production reactors where the require-
‘ments are less. severe and the radiation levels are much lower - The type

Grade CGB Craphite

_ Grade CGB graphite was designed for use in molten-salt reactors and
was first made in comnercial quantities for the MSRE. dIﬁ is'basicelly x5
a petroleum needle coke that is bonded withdceei—tar pitch, extruded to
rough shape, and heated to 5072°F. Improved dimehsional”stabilifyfunder =
irradistion is ensured by not using amorphous carbon ma%erialsrsuch-ase
carbon black in the base stock.- High density and low permeation are
achieved fhroughfmultiple'impregnatiens'and'heat treatments. All compo-
nents are fired to 5072°F or higher. The product is essentially a well-
graphitized material and.is'highly"anisotropic.w Its properties are
tabulated in Table 9. LT e Tl

Grade CGB graphite represents significant progress in the develop- “,
ment of a low-permeability radiation-resistant graphite. Ekperiments '
have demonstrated that the multiple 1mpregnations required to dbtain the
low permesbility and small open-pore size do not appreciably alter the |
dimensional stability compared to conventional needle-coke graphites.

In manufacturing the material for the MSRE, - experimental equipment
and processes were used on a commercial scale for -the first time by the
- Carbon Products Division of Union Carbide Corporation to‘pfoduCe'bars
2.50 in. square and 72 in. long which were machined to the shapes -
required for the MSRE. The bars were the 1argest that could be produced
by the then-current technology to meet the requirements of. low permeabil—-
ity to salt and gases end resistance to't&diatibn'effects. Assembly of
the MSRE core from bars of the graphite is shown in Fig. 25

 Permeability

'Some'of the more”stringent specifications on graphite for MSER will

_ be on permeability. 4O Values will be specified for perrieability to both:

molten salts and to helium The screening test for salt permeability is

to expose evacuated specimens for 100 hr to molten salt at 1300°F under

8 pressure of 150 ps1g.4 The MSRE de51gn spec1f1cations reqnired that

f-less than O. 5% of the bulk’ volume of the graphite should be filled with
salt and that the salt should not penetrate the graphite matrix Speci~
‘mens of grade CGB had an average of less than 0. 2% of their bulk volume

permeated by salt in these screening tests, and . the salt distribution

-~ . was limited to shallow penetrations at the surfaces and along cracks
" which intersected ‘the exterior surfaces. The salt that entered the

cracks was confined to the cracks and a8 shown in Fig 27, did not

.. permeate the matrix. The permeation characteristics of the graphite as

 determined by test should be representative since irradiation does not

appear to change the wetting characteristics of the salt and the screening

pressures are three times the maximum design preBSure for the MSRE core.
The limit on gas permeability ‘has played a major. role in establishing

the fabrication sequence for the graphite Low permeability to gases is

desirable to prevent gaseous fission products from entering the graphite.

We would like a graphite for the 'MSER with a helium permeability of

10"7 2/sec. While it has been possible to obtain graphites meeting the

o salt-permeability requirements, 1t has not been possible to reduce the

- gas . permeability to the lO 7 level | Crack-free CGB graphite in the MSRE

f;pexhibited average helium permeability values of 3 X 10'4 cmz/sec As
"jpjpreviously discussed this graphite was fabricated using special proce—_.

f;fdures aimed at low porOSity.. The graphite tubes for MSER'will have much
_"ihthinner cross sections and should be less permeable. ‘At present, it
pf'ﬁwould appear. that values of O s cmz/sec would ‘be about 2ll that cen be

The isotropic graphite is made in various shapes with conventional
carbonraad'graphite molding and extruding equipment. Bulk densities can
range from < 1,40 to 1.90 g/cm3. The strengths of various grades tend
to exceed those of grades of conventional, anisotropic graphite.

Past work has not been directed toward producing isotropic graphite
with the low permeabilitles required for molten-salt breeder reactors.
Pipes of grade H-315-A (Table 10) have been made that are approximately
4.5 in. in diameter with O. 50-in.-wall thickness which would correspond
to the large MSBR pipes. These pipes had an average bulk den81ty of
1.83 g/cm3 and radlally they had a permeability to helium of 2 X 10‘3
to 1 X 10”2 ecm?/sec. The lower value refers to the unmachined pipe and
the higher value to pieces machined from the pipe. walls. Pore spectrum
measurements indicated that approximately 50% of the pore volume had
pore entrance diameters betweeh 0.5 and 3.5 p and less than'lﬁ% of the
pore volume had pore entrance dismeters > 3.5 p. This pore spectrum  '
suggests that this material, although it was not designed for it, might
be suitable base stock to impregnate to preduce 1cw-permeabi1ityrgraphite.
of ceurse, in fabricating graphite for MSBR use one woald want to opti-
mize the base stock for impregnation which would mean that the base

stock would be fabricated with pore entrances less than 1 p in diameter.
| In the following program, the isotropic graphite will be considered
as the reference material. However, until its development has proceeded
to the point that meeting the MSBR requirements is reasonsbly assured,
it will be necessary to continue the development of the anisotropic
needle-coke graphite as backup material. Most of the data obtained to
date have been with needle-coke graphite; however, much of this
technology is transferable to the 1sotropic graphite.

Joining

The MSBR is unique among reactors in that it uses graphite as an

engineering material and the present conceptual design calls for graphite-

Only 8 few brazing alloys are suitable for brazing graphite for

the graphite. These transition materials_would, in\turn,”be joined to
the Hastelloy N by brazing. Therefore, refractory metals, such as
molybdeﬁum and tungsten, which have thermal expansion coefficients more
closely matched to graphite as well as much higher strengths, have been
selected as prcmising transition materials.
The joint utilizing the refractory metal transition piece ‘has
.received considerable attention. The ductile and corrosion-resistant
alloy, 82%;Au—18% Ni, was chosen:aé.a-starting pcint for mclfen-salt 1
applications. To this base meterial has been added the corrosion- ‘c,- _
resistant, strong carbide formers, molybdenum and tantalum. As a result,
‘alloys in both the Au-Ni-Mo and Au-Ni-Ta systems were developed4’ which,

| graphite-to-molybdenum joints have been made with ANM-16 by induction
braiing in an inert atmosphére and vacuum brazing in.a muffle furnace.
A brazing temperature of 2282 to 2372°F was used. Several componeuts
have been brazed with this alloy, the largest of which have been o

If brazing conditions are controlled closely, the joints appear
sound in all respects. However, if the assembly is maintained at brazing:

 

temperature longer than necessary or if too high a brazingftemperature
is used, the alloy in the fillet spreads onto the surface of ‘the graphite

Compatibility of Graphite with Molten Salts

Since the MSBR uses grephite in direct contact with the molten-salt -
fuel and the breeder blanket, good compatibility between graphite and
Hastelloy N in these molten fluorides is needed. Tests performed have
indicated that excellent compatibility exists. The tendency for
Hastelloy N to be carburizediwas investigated'in static pots containing
LiF-BeF,-UF; (67-32-1 mole %) and a graphite at 1300°F for times ranging
from 2000 to 12 000 hr. No carburization was metallographically detected
on specimens from.any of the above tests.49 Tensile properties were'

" determined on specimens included in each test. A comparison of the
tensile strengths and elongation values of the tested specimens with
those of the control specimens indicated that no slgnificant change

| occurred in the test specimens. _

The thin-wall tubular désign used in the MSER is one of the better
configurations in reducing the differential growth problem to within the
capabilities of the'graphité. The tubular shape also has the advantages '
of good fabricability and‘reliable nondestructuve testing'techniquéé to
ensure maximum integrity initially. Extrapolation of irradiation damage
data for doses to 2 X 1022 neutrons/cm?® leads to the conclusion that
graphite should have an adequate life in the MSER. waever, we cannot
conclude this with certainty until'we have exposed graphlte to the doses"
anticipated for the MSBR.

Although theére is no experimental evidence beyond _

2 x 1022 neutrons/cm s, several factors lead to optimism. about ‘the abillty
of graphite to .sustain much greater‘damage. ‘The first factor is the_
recognition that in the 1292°F temperature range_the:cqntracturalvdimen_
sional changes for the first 10?2 neutrons/cm? are due to the repair of
the damage caused by cooling the graphite from its graphitization temper-
ature. Doses above lOzz_ﬁeu.trons/cni2 produce an expansion in the “c"
direction and a contraction in the "a" direction. 1In effect, the
Stresses produced-normal to the basal planes will be compressivé rather
than tensile. This, of course, is very much preferred in that the
crystal can sustain this type of loading more readily without cracking.
Even so, measurements obtained from-irradiated pyrolytic graphites
indicate that a deformation rate of about 1% shear strain per

1021 neutrons/cem? must be absorbed. Thus, for a 5-year life, the graph-
ite tubes operating in a flux region of 6 X 1014 neutrons cm™? sec™

absorb an internal deformation of about 100% shear strain. There is evi-

must

dence, howeVer, that graphite can sustain this type of internal déformation
without creating micrbcracks.‘ Very fine crystallite pyrocarbons have

been irradiated under conditions prbdubing crystallite shearing'rates

of 60% per 10?2 neutrons/cm® (ref. 51) and have demonstrated the ability
to absorb 160% shear strain without observable internal cracking or loss

of integrity. Thus, 1t is difficult to predict whether the anisotropic

.in establishing the schedule for the MSBR. The problem is complicated
by the long lead time required to obtain in-reactor mechanical property
data and by the fact that the solution appears to lie in a change in .
eomposition This'means'that'once a modified radiation—resistant'alloy
is developed, it will be necessary to determine if the changes in composi-
tion have affected any other properties. Another complication is that it
has been shown that the radiation damage is sensitive to fabrication
practice, so to be truly representative, material used will have to be
_gtaken‘from large commercial heatsr' Obviously, a compromise*is required
in which small laboratory heats will be used initially for screening with
the results being confirmed with material from the large heats. The
fabrication practices for the large and. small heats will be kept as nearly
alike 8s possible
Our work has shown that titanium, zirconium, and hafnium are effec-
tive additions that will reduce the radiation damage of Hastelloy N. We
have not established the exact mechanism re5ponsible forrthe iﬁproﬁement,
but feel that it is associated with the reactivity of these elements with
boron and other impurities in Hastelloy N. Con
During the first year, screening-type tests are being run. | The
major goal is to determine which of the additives appears ‘to be- the most
effective and to begin obtaining an indication of the optimum‘composition
Machined specimens are being irradiated in capsules at elevated tempera-
-tures; on removal they are used to determine the tensile and creep-rupture
properties of the material. During this period, most testing will be on
laboratory-size vacuum-melts and on small (100 lb) commercial melts.
These irradiations are being conducted in the ORNL Research Reactor and
,the Engineering Test Reactor. _ .
, A limited number of ccmpositions will be evaluated by being inserted
into the core of the MSRE. These samples will be added as the surveil-
lance specimens are removed for testing. These samples Wlll be tested

Corrosion Program

Molten Salt. — Since the reference design of the MSBR primary coolant
circult incdrporates,the same,basic‘fuel salts and construction materials
as the MSRE, an extensive-corrosion program will not be required. The

large volume of data'generated during the development and operation of

.rthe MSRE is directly applicable to the MSBR and has demonstrated that an

acceptable system has been developed | _
Corrosion testing for the primary system will be mainly in the area

'of proof testing As compos1tional adjustments are made to the Hastelloy N

or to the graphite, their effects on oorrosion will have to. be determined

| :The active metals being proposed as a solution to the radiation-
'e,embrittlement problem may inorease the corr031on rate, although our pre-‘
. vious experience indicates that the effect will be small.: Alloys of
_modified comp081tion will be evaluated initially in thermal-oonvection
| loops. As The final composition 1s established more firmly, the corrosion
~ behavior Will be better establlshed by pump loops.

 
 

68 . ' = L | 7' '

Sufficient information is ‘available to indicate that corrosion prob-,- : ..
lems are not to be expected in the blanket salt system; however, because |
‘of fewer tests, such a conclusion.is not as well substantiated as that
for the primary system. It will be necessary to operate thermal-convection
and pump loops with the actual pr0posed salt composition~as'proof'tests ,
As with the primary system, any'major changes in Hastelloy N or graphite
will be checked with these salts. ' o

Another area of corrosion testing is anticipated in association w1th
the development of a low-melting coolant salt for the MSBR. Studies of .
both fluorcborate and stannous fluoride Systemsrare currently under way;_
for this application. Neither salt'system has been subjected to;evaluaef
tions in prior corrosion studies, and corrosion data will cbviously be
required in the overall assessment of their properties relative to the
Additional corrosion studies are being planned in support of goals
of longer range than the MSER. In particular, the improvements in purity ‘
and chemical stablility of flnoride systems have brought us to a stage

where it appears reasonable to consider the use of austenitic stainless

4

steels as salt-containment materials. The transition fromta nickel- to -
iron-base alloy offers important economic advantages in larger sized
molten-salt reactor plants, and there is a strong incentive for eXaminingi
the utility of iron-base systems in the coolant-salt region alone, L
Accordingly, we plan to investigate the behavior of stalnless steels in
the presence of the LiF-BeF, salt system both as a function of salt-

processing techniques and exposure temperatures,

These tests should yvield useful heat transfer data as well as prov1de

Joining,@evelopment

| While a detalled examination of the joining problems for theiMSBR
‘cannot be msde until designs have progressed beyond the conceptual phase,
a tentative evaluation has been- conducted to reveal the ma jor problem
areas. The fabrication problems: fall into two categories: (1) the

will be by far the more: dlfficult of the two since, in most cases, it
must be maintained remotely. ' o R

. General Welding Development of Hastelloy N. — The welding of

Hastelloy N has been developed to the point that it was possible to con-

~ struct the MSRE using a wide variety of welded joints. . However, before

a MSER is eonstructed -additional welding development is desirable,  This

general welding development will be aimed primarily at a better under— \
_standing of the weld-cracklng problem which -has been encountered with
Hastelloy N but is also common to all high-nickel -alloys.

Weld-cracking problems have: sporadically occurred, in commercial _
heats of Hastelloy N manufactured to the same specification and bygthe
samé procedure. While we were able to work around this problem by using

a weld-cracking test to select the material, the cause was not established.
To avoid this problem, welding and metallurgical studies aimed at under-

standing the baeic reasons -for cracking will be conducted. . Previeus-,
indications that cracking'was-associated with segregation-of~alloying
elements need to be expanded to . a widersvariety ofecompoaitions. These
studies will rely heavily on the use of the electron microprobe to =
delineate the segregation. Welds will be made in material prepared-fbrj‘
the radiation damage program and also in 5pecial‘small'heats specifically
for welding studies. The various compositions will be welded at several
heat inpdts with restraint applied to the pieces. Heats showiag tenden-
cles to crack will be studied on the "Gleeble"61’which will be programmed
to magnify any effects resulting from heating.

As work progresses .on .the development of,a=radiationrresistant alloy,-

it will be necessary to conduct weldability studies on the likely candi-
dates.r Zirconium, one of the attractive alloying additions, is knowﬁ-to
be detrimental to welding. Attempts will therefore be made to;finda set
of welding parameters that will be adaptable to the zirdoniumecontaihing ‘

alloys. It will also be necessary to make welds that can be fabricated

into 1rradiation samples to demonstrate adequate radiation res1stance of

the weldments

- Currently, the filler metals used for welding Hastelloy N are of the '

same ‘composition as the base material. Results in the two previous

| programs will be examined forlindications-of ways to improve the welds
,hy changing the composition-pf'the filler'metals. Possible improvements
will be sought by.eliminating impurities'known to be harmful or by the

addition of other elements'to alter the form of the harmful impurity.
Preliminary tests have indicated that the addition of either niobium or
tungsten to the filler metal.will 1mprove weldability ThlS lead will
be pursued and the composition optimized

- Joining Development for Components.'— As the engineering components'

get larger and the reactor power increases, it w1ll be necessary to use

heav1er sections An’ construction. With such sections, there w1ll be an
econonic incentlve to use welding processes capable of high depos1tion
rates. All previous welding of Hastelloy N has been with the tungsten-
arc process which is reliable but slow. Processes of potential 1nterest
for the higher depositiOn rates are gas metal-arc, submerged-arc and
plasma welding. These processes by their very natures utilize high heat

inputs and, therefore, studies of their heat-affected zones will be

‘required Welding parameters will be established for any process which

in the prelimunary testing, looks promising These processes will also

be studied as to their suitability for use in remote welding
- Procedures for making tube to-header Joints for small tubes (O 50 in.)

m;were developed and used successfully for the MSRE heat exchanger These
1Joints were welded and then baek-brazed For the MSBR, a- large number |
'.of such Joints, many with much larger tubes, will be required The ma jor
 welding development effort in- this area therefore will be to adapt the
\'present techniques to. the new geometries and to automate them. While
'f manual welding is. possible, the large number of sueh welds make automation,

appear imperative | Because of the larger size components required and

limitetionS'in sizes of trazing or ennealing’furnaces, it msy be necessary
_tothendle the bundles in subsections whichiare‘subsequently welded
together. | .

To reduce the costs and to simplify the designs, the'elimination of
back-brazing will be explored. Conventional mechanical-expanding tech-
niques; such as rolling or plug drawing, will be investigated and tested
‘for reiiability. Use of high energy forming for expanding and bonding _
would appeer to be & promising technique. We have the equipcnent at ORNL
for these processes and will investigate them further.

-Remote Joining. -A.meaor progrem will be required to develop remote
welding and brazing techniques. It will be necessary to first develop
techniques for the specific geometry end then to gdapt them to remote
operation. The development of the positioning end guiding fixtures will
be a major‘part of the program. These phases of the program will be part
'of the maintenance equipment development 62 Several different types of
remote welds will be required and they will be sufflciently different to
require separate development o

. Although the welds differ in 'size and geometry, the programs for
their development will attempt to answer 51milar questions. The general

 

questions ares

1. Which welding technique will be most reliable?

2. What are the necessary welding parameters, such as voltage,
current, wire feed rate, and torch speed, and over vhat limits may they
vary? This will include sequences for start, Operation, and stop.

3. What is the recommended Joint design, and how much misalignment
of the pieces can be permitted? . o o

4, How pure an inert atmDSphere will be required both inside and

 

outside the pipe?
5. What are the effects of small amounts of fluoride contsminetion?,‘

6. Wnat is the permissible misalignment of the welding torch?

'7? How will the pipes and the torch be positioned?

The major problem with the Hastelloy N- to-Hastelloy‘N butt JOints
in tubes will be the limited space around each pipe; this is-approx1mately
1 in. Present plans are to develop a s1ngle procedure for the initial
assembly and for remote repairs Several_weld joint designs appear
possible and will be Investigated. .A-concurrent'effort_will be conducted
on remote brazing for joining these tubes. This techniqne, which was
developed for the MSRE, makes use of a conical- -type joint in which one
member must either twist or slide as the braze metal melts .8

‘A single development effort should suffice for all -the large
(approx 12-in.-diam) remote pipe joints. Many of'these Joints are
containment members, so a high degree of reliability will be reqnired

This makes remote welding much more attractive than mechanical-goining=

. techniques,- While these pipes are of large diameter,-they_dolnot have
heavy walls, 'However,:the'additiOn\of fillerumetalrwillibe necessary.

After completion of exploratory studies, a selection of the applicable
welding process will be made. . Welds similar to these were developed by
Westinghouse for the Pennsylvania Advanced Reactor,64 and their procedures
will serve as a starting point A complication with these welds will be
the tight 1imit;onrpipe,lengths required to minimize fuel inventory. The
positioning and aligning-present difficulties.since‘short;;large- -

diameter pipes are very rigid,— An'insert may be.requiredato gnide,the

g _pipes together.

- If one tube of a heat exchanger develOps & 1eak, it w1ll have to

. be plugged or the whole unit will have to be replaced.; It Wlll be neces-
lsary to plug the ends of the failed tube through a small access port in

. each.end of.the exchanger Such plugging procedures are standard on -

positioning equipment for such & job would be similar to that used to
cut small pieces from the HRT core tank. ¢ | : L

| For such an application, a plug must be developed which can be
inserted‘into the tube and then fused to the header. A major problem
will be-that'snch a weld is by nature highly restrained and is, therefdre,
subject to cracking. This may require trepanning the head before the
plug is inserted and welded. | | - -

Inspection Development

While a complete evaluation of testing and inSpection problems cannot
be made until a firm design is- available, some are apparent from the con-'r_

ceptual design. The ones requiring most attention are those that will have

to be made remotely. Inspection development for the Hastelloy N tubing.
and pipe will consist of adapting available techniques to the necessary
configurations and to the required sensitivity levels. The techniqpesu
developed for inspecting the MSRE heat exchanger should also be adaptable
" to the MSER heat exchangers. ‘Techniques to be used would include
penetrants, radiography, and ultrasonics. A

Remote inspection will be required for (1) Hastelloy N tube Joints
at the fuel header, (2) large butt-weld pipe joints to disconnect “the
main piping from both the reactor and the heat exchangers, and (3) plugs

in the heat exchanger tubes. ‘Until develo@ment of the joining techniques

has progressed further, it is impractical to speculate on inspection |
. procedures. Several testing techniques will be evaluated

In developing the nondestructive testing techniques, three phases
‘must be completed (not necessarily in sequence). They are (1) demonstra-
tion of feasibility, (2) determination of test sensitivity and establish-

ment of reference standards, and (3) development of detailed techniques
and eqpipment

For the remotely inspected joints, each of the steps must first be

_ performed in'a'coldrlaborétory (but with cognizance of the need to

progress to remote operation) and then the necessary mechanlcal devices
must be,developed for the remote,performance. It may be possible to
devise accessories which can~beiattached»to the manlpulators used to

fabricate the joints.

Materials Development for Chemical Processing Equipment

 

The fuel salt will have to be continually reprocessed to remove

fission products. The present concept of this processing calls for dis--

tilling the salt at a temperature of about 1800°F. The strength require-

ments are quite modeet,;but-the'material will be exposed to salt on one

side and to some gaseous atmosphere on the other side. The easiest gas-

eous atmosphere to obtain is the cell environment which is N, + ~2% Oy .

This would require that the material be fairly resistant to oxidation and

nitriding.--Theioxidation resistance is improved by increasing the chro-

mium content of the alloy, bﬁt:this.in turn inereases the corrosion rate

on the salt-side; We feel that several possibilities exist for materials

for constructing this vessel. - - |

1. Hastelloy N with an inert cover gas,

2. a molybdenum-base alloyﬂwith an inert cover gas, |

3. a duplex system with arnickel-molybdenum alloy, exposed to the salt
and an oxldatlon-resistant materlal such as Haynes alloy No. 25

_exposed to the: cell env1ronment

-'4.! a vessel made of an oxidatlon-resistant alloy with a graphlte liner.

- These possibllities and. others will have to be explored by screening

| ftests to determlne re51stance to. ox1dat10n, nitriding, and salt corrosion.
”_The ease of fabricability and cost of the candidate materials will also -
',be considered in making a flnal choice.

‘5,1;Gféﬁﬁite_Program;'«f

The graphlte that we need for this reactor requires that some advances
be made in present technology Therefore, our first concern is to procure

material that meets our75pe01f1catlons for study. The ma jor 1tems to be

 
 

 

76

evaluated for this material are (1) determining its behavior at radiation
dose levels as high as possible, (2) joining of graphite-to-itself_and'to
structural materials, (3) fabrication development to yield a low gas
permeability, (4) evaluation and charaCterization of the~m0dified'or'
improved graphite, (5) determining its compatlbllity when used with
Hastelloy'N in a system circulating fused salts at elevated temperatures,
and (6) fabrication of the graphite into engineering systems and evaluating -
its performance. Because of its greater potential for reducing radiation
damage effects, the major effort will be on the development of isotropic
graphite, However, this material is so new and so little is known about
it, development of anisotropic graphite such as the needle-coke'types

will also be continued. The proposed development program is- discussed

in the f01lowing sections. - '

Graphite Fabrication and Evaluation

- The grade CGB graphite used in the MSRE was produced in experimental i

equipment and its properties still leave much to be desired for a MSBR. -
No graphite from any source is now available that w1ll meet all of the e
MSBR requirements, Since there is no present industriel need for low= .
permeability graphite, we are not likely to obtain much allied develop-
ment help from industry. An adequate supply of the highest'quality.
graphite will be purchased to supply material for use in test rigs, to
establish reasonable specifications, and for evaluation. Continuing
orders will be placed as improvements, or potential improvements, are
made in the quality. The intent is to progress in order size from the
laboratory to the pilot plant and then to a.production;size order. Until
msteriel is actually produced in production equipment and is teSted' -
dodbt will exist as to how representative the smaller. batches really are,
It is expected that grade CGB or a similar grsphite will be used in the
first tests.
The various problems to be faced will include:
1. As soon as p0381ble, consult with msnufacturers end.prepare a
specification for small lots (1aboratory quantltles) of graphite of as - e
near MSBR quelity as it is pOSS1ble to obtaln immedietely | ' ' kaj

R. Place small orders for both 1sotropic and anisotrqpic grades of
graphite in the form of block and pipe.-f o -

3.  Measure pertinent physical and.mechanlcal properties of
representative graphites. - - -
_ 4, In about 1 year, prepare a Specification for a pllOt-Slze batch
- of the most prom1S1ng type, or types, of graphite | It 1s not expected _
that any significant new radiation-damage 1nformation w1ll be available
at this time. e _ | L

5. If suitable graphite cannot be purchased from out31de sources,

an in-house pilot-production facility will have to be established

. Irradiation Behavior

In laylng out any graphite development program, an enigma rapidly
‘becomes apparent One of the major unknowns is the effect of massive |
neutron doses. To Obtain the desired doses requires irradiation periods
of two to three years, and we,would like to firmly establish in three
years that graphite will have an acceptable 1ife in the MSBR._ The problem
therefore 1is that, if during the development period wmajor changes are made
in the graphite, the graphite being irradiated will no longer be repre-
sentative and the results will therefore be suspect. The most satisfactory.
solution appears to be starting irradiation tests as soon as possible with
samples fabricated from the highest quality material availahle and to fol-
low these with other tests of improved material The purpose of the work
would be to determine first the dimenszonal stability of the graphite for

__.the temperatures and high-radiation doses that would have to be sustained
~in the MSBR plus the effects of irradiation on the. graphite properties,
isuch as creep ductility, mechanical.pmoperties, accessible voids, and

"'-permeability. - The. inclusion of ‘both anisotropic and isotropic graphite
is warranted since the anisotropic has more technological development
~behind it, but the isotrOpic graphite which has been under development for

-approximately three years shows more potential These experiments should

,-Ebe performed on graphlte, graphite~to-graph1te Joints, and graphite-to-

' Hastelloy N joints. | o

To demonstrate the ability of graphite to sucCessfully ret&in_its |
integrity after exposure to dose levels of 1 >< 1023 neutrons/cm? (5-year
life), we plan'fo irradiate gfephite to as near this dose as possible.
This will require the irradiations to be performed in reactors that have

fast fluxes of 1015 neutrons cm=? sec™l or greater to obtain the data in

a reasonable time. At present,-there are only tworfast reactors, EBR-1I
and Dbunfeay, and one thermal reactor, HFIR, that approach the'fast-flux

requirements.' Approximate values of the time required to reach a dose

‘of 1 x 1023 neutrons/cm , cost per year, and facility size are listed in,

It is, therefore, proposed to use HFIR to demonstrate the ebility 7
of the graphite to retain its integrity after an exposure of -
1 x 102> neutrons/cm®. Due to the size limitation of HFIR, the irradi-
ation will be restricted to simply prepost type of-testing. To |
demonstrate the ability of the MSBR graphite to absorb creep"Strein,
restrained growth type experiments will be performed in EBR-II. By
enforcing & creep rate equal to the growth rate, the creep strain
aceumulation.will be forced into the material ten times faster than.
under MSBR conditions. Although en equivalent neutron exposure will
not be’achieved,'the enforced strain will be-greater than expected in
the MSER, - I

Graphite Joining

Since,the graphite-to-Hastelloy N joint is a_very important part of
the system, we will carry}parallel efforts on at least two different types
of joint;-fBraze'joints.ofnseveral designs will be evaluated using the
35%‘N1—60%'Pd%5% Cr allcy\and'pure copper as brazing,materials.; These. -
joints will be designed so that graphite is initially in compression
where it is strongest and has the ability to undergo small smounts of
plastic strain. This will.minimiZe the'tensile stress that will develop
‘in the graphite as it shrinks due to irradiation.. A mechanical type of
joint will also be evaluated as a second preference. “These joints will
be made u31ng the 5-1n.i0D'Xel/2-in,-wall.graphite pipes that are,presently
in the MSBR design. These joints will be subjected to thermal cycling, -
evaluated'for'corrosion'resistaﬁce'to the'fuel-and'blanket,salts, and
irradiated to determine integrity under service conditions, - o

'The’graphite;to-graphite joint'will be studied in'detail | Based on
this study the choice will be made between a graphitized Jjoint and a |
brazed joint. : | o

Permeability Studies
| As'"imprcred“'grades”dfigraphite are received from producers, it
will be necessary to determine their permeability for molten fluorides,

Corrosion and Compatibility of Graphite

Some additional data will be obtalned on the compatibility of graphite
with Hastelloy N in systems c1rculat1ng high-temperature fused salts. The
testing must also include the brazed 301nts. Initial tests will be simple
capsule tests containing both materials. Then small—scale grephlte and
graphite-Hastelloy N thermal-convection loops will be fabrlcated and
operated with fused salts to determlne the compatibllity and corrosion '
resistance of these materials. The final stage will,be_testing in—the .
engineering loops to evaluate-full-scale.conponents.'.Theseflarge'loops :
are e part of the component developnent progranm, 'The functionrof'this

lance Program with subsequent evaluation of fission—product retention

and changes in mechanical and physical properties.

Graphite InsPection

The necessary nondestructive testing program for the graphite tubes
proposed to be used for MSBR would cover severel test methods It is
7anticipated.that,eddy-current techniqnes would be used for dimensional
kgaging.and both lowsvoltage.rsdiography.and eddy-current“techniques would
be used to detect discontinuities, If laminations are present and unde-
sirable, it may be necessary to use nltresonics or infrared techniqnes;
to detect them, For geometries more complex than concentrlc tubes, the
seme methods would likely be pursued. However, there would be more
requirement for dimensional gaging and the flaﬁafinding techniques WOuld |
be more difficult to develop. The development would proceediin_the_;;

following steps (not necessarily in sequence):

General Development and Proaect A851stance

- Many details of the f1nal design will depend upon the properties of

the two primary structural materials -~ graphlte and modified Hastelloy N.
. As we progress with the development of these materials, we will keep the

designers informed, so that this information can be 1ncorporated in the

_de51gn. Several of the planned engineering tests‘w1ll,also require
| assistanCe. We shall be called upon for design assistance and fabrica-
ftion technology. The evaluation of many of the test results will be made

by'materials"personnel. ‘After working with the vendors to obtain the
desired products and With.thepdesigners to finalize the MSBR design, we
will take an active part in writing thedSpecifications, procuring the
materials, and assisting;in}the'actual oonstruction.

‘Several parts of the proposed molten-salt systems could probably
be made'of'cheaper materials;~such as the-austenitic stainless steels.
We do not have adequate corrosion data on these materials, but tests

will be initiated to obtaln this informatlon on a second prlorlty basis

e'We w1ll crltlcally assess the properties of these materials for thiS'

o program and 1ntroduce them where they appear advantageous.
