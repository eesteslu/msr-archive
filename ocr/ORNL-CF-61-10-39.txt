Abstract

Equations which describe delayed neutron losses in external
loops of circulating fuel reactors were derived. A working equation
- | and the necessary input data for calculating delayed neutron losses
' by an equilibrium reactor code such as ERC-5 are given.

DELAYED NEUTRON LOSSES IN CIRCULATING FUEL REACTORS

Circulating fuel reactors lose neutrons because some of the delayed
neutrons are emitted outside of the core. These losses depend on core
residence time, external loop residence time, and decay characteristics of
the precursors.

A symbolic representation of the system is

)ij = decay constant of the ith precursor from fissionable material j,
Bij = number of ith precursors formed per fission neutron from fis-
sionable material j,
Nijc = atoms of ith precursor per unit volume of fuel stream in the
core resulting from fissions in material j, |
NijE = gagtoms of ith precursor per unit volume of fuel stream in the
external loops resulting from fissions in material j,
fc = volume fraction of fuel in the core,
fE = volume fraction of fuel in the external loops,
V. = core volume,

VE = eXternal loop volume,
 

pjzfj¢ﬁnﬂz = rate of production of fission neutrons in the core from
fissionable material J.

The precursor concentrations are described by these equations:

I [ .
e Pig¥ P - Mige > (1)
dNi‘E
dt, - MisE 2 (2)
where
tc = +time in the core,
tE‘ = +time in the external loops.

The boundary conditions are:

Nijc(TC) = NijE(O) , (3)
where
Tc = time for the fuel stream to pass through the core,
TE = +time for the fuel stream to pass through the external loops.

The solutions to Egs. (1) and (2) are:

B, V.20 A, st “A o b

Note that the precursor production rate is assumed constant for the fuel

stream during its stay in the core. This idealized case would exist only

for uniform power density along the fuel stream or for core residence times

 
which are short compared to the half-life of the precursor.
The boundary conditions become:

B, V. 2.0 -A; ;T -A; T

_i%zﬁ—gi—(mR‘ e 1Y ) + Nijc(o) e C - NijE(O) ’ (7)

Nijc(o) = NijE(O) e 1IE (8)

Eliminating Nijc(o) in Egs. (7) and (8) and substituting the result in
Eq. (6) gives:

The rate of decay of precursors in the external loops is:

The total rate of precursor decay (at equilibrium)is Bijvjzfj¢fcvc' Thus

the fraction of the delayed neutrons which appear in external loops is:
