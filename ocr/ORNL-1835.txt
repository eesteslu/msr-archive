FOREWORD

The Atomlc Energy Commission requires ‘that a Reactor Hazards Summary

‘Report be submitted and approved‘by the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safe-

guards prior to the operation of a new reactor or the modification of an
existing reactor in order to determine, and thus assure, the safety of the

Commission's various reactor projects. In accordance with USAEC-OR-8401,

Reactor Safety Determinstion, this report describes the hazards that may
conceivably be associated with the Aircraft Reactor Test. All possible

types of hazards are described as well ss the extent to which these hazards -

have been evaluated and considered in the design and proposed operation of
the reactor. ,

ATRCRAFT REACTOR TEST

 HAZARDS SUMMARY REPORT

l, INTRODUCTION.AND SUMMARY

The successful completion of g program of experiments, includlng the
Aircraft Reactor Experiment (ARE),l has demonstrated the high probability
of producing militarily useful aircraft nuclear power plants employing re-
flector—moderated circulating-fuel reactors. Consequently, an accelerated
program culminating in operation of the Aircraft Reactor Test (ART) is under
way. In order to adhere to the compressed ‘schedule of the aceelerated pro-
gram, it is essential that the Atomic Energy Commission approve the 7500 Area
in 0Oak Ridge as the test site by February 15, 1955. This report summarizes
the hazards associated with operating the contained 60-Mw reactor of the ART
at the proposed Qak Ridge test site.

Descriptions are gilven of the reactor, reactor cell, test site, reactor
controls, end.cpérgting plan, prior to presentation of the hazards consider-
ations. The hazards are classified into three major categories: 1) acci-
dents with an apprec1able probability of occurring, 2) accidents causing
rupture of the pressure shell, and 3) accidents causing rupture of the re-
actor cell,’ ‘Category (1) accidents would involve minor difficulties in the
1ntegr1ty of the reactor system and would not result in injury to operating
personnel or the surrounding population. Category (2) accidents, which are
extreme nuclear excursions, might be caused by and can gause major breaks in
the rédctor assembly, but due to the presence of the reactor cell which would
remain 1ntact there would be no injury to operating personnel or other
peoples ~ The causes of category (2) accidents are described in a general man-

~ per since it has been impossible to date to describe a specific series of
events that would lead to an extreme nuclear excursions In the total facil-

ity destruction; category (3), the reactor and the reactor ‘cell would be |
ruptured to release the accumulated fission prodacts, but this could ‘only be
accomplished by means of extremely clever distribution of large guantities

- of explosives by a saboteur or by a large aerial bomb. In the analysis the
_-most severe case has been presemed° namely, that cemplete volatilization of

‘all of the fuel would occur. This is highly improbable since any such acci-

;f;dent would require a large amount of heat at a high temperature, and its oc-
> e»;currence_githout dispersion ‘of ‘much of the fuel in particulate formcseems to be
'_@~unliké' . In addition, quantities of other materials that would also be

The reactor of the ART is t0 be a 60~Mw reflector-moderated circu~

"latlng-fuel Eype whose basic design is ‘suitable for reactors to be used

in aircraft.§ The size and weight of +the reactor and shield will conform

‘. with aircraft requirements, and, insofar as possible in the limited time
. available, the design of the 1mportant components will be based on concepts
'satlsfactory for airborne applicatlonso

' Operatlon of the ARE demonstrated that a hlgh temperature c1rculat1ng-

fuel reactor could be built and operated and that materials and machlnery for
“satlsfactory operatlon at elevated temperatures ‘had been developed° It show-
ed that the predicted large negative temperature coefficient of reactivity '

and the resultant self-regulatory characteristics of the reactor could be

V_echieved. In addition, it was found that most of the Xel3> was removed. Trom
the fuel 1nto the gaiiglanket space in the pump so that the steady-state con-
'centration of the Xe

was only 3% of the normal equillbrium value.

The neW'princ1ple of design introduced in the ART consists of circulat-'M

ing the fuel through the reactor in a single, thick, annular passage and
achieving the major portlon of the moderation with a beryllium reflector
which will also serve as an important portion of the shield. With the re-
sultlng reduction’ 1n shlelding requirements it has been possible to design
the ART reactor in such a way that the entire fuel system is contained with-
in a suff1c1ently small, shielded volume to provide a low-weight shield and
a useful alrcraft reactoro_ The purpose of the Aircraft Reactor Test is to

'valldate +the methods ‘of construction and the predicted operatlng character—

istics of such a reflector-moderated cireulating-fuel reactoro

A reactor power “of 60 Mw was selected because 1t is agproximstely the '
power that must be reached to demonstrate that the engineering problems are
solved and that the operating characteristics are satisfactory for the high-
er powered reactors to be used in high-altitude supersonic strategic bombers.
In addition, & reactor with a power level in the 60-Mw range will provide
sufficient power to fly radar picket ships, patrol bombers, and other desir-

gble aircraft. For a power level above 60 Mw, the cost appears to be di- -

rectly proportional to the power. Also it does appear that a thoroughly
satisfactory 200-Mw reactor can be built more quickly by first building a
60-Mw reactor and then following it with a 200-Mw reactor in which the
benefits of the experlence gained with the 60-Mw reactor will have been
incorporated.

, The design of the ART envi51ons an essentially spherical reactor 1n_’ '
which the berylllum moderator will be lumped in a central island and in an
outer annulus (see Fig. 2.1, Sec. 2, this report). Two centrifugal pumps,
arranged in parallel, will circulate the fuel downward between the inner
beryllium island and the outer beryllium reflector and out of the bottom
of the core. The fuel will then turn and flow upward through the heat ex-
changer region, which is around the spherical core. From the heat exchanger
region the fuel will return to the pumps and will again be discharged down-
ward into the core. The reactor heat will be transferred in the heat -

acceptable physical proPertiesg 'In particular, the NaF-ZrF, -UF, fuel mixture

1s known to be satisfactory. The mixture NeF-KF-LiF-UF) has some very de-
sirable properties and is unﬂer intensive investigation.

~ Quite a variety ef shielaing arrangements has béen censmdered for the
ART. The most promising seems to be one functionally the same as that for
an aircraft requiring a unit shield; namely, a shield designed to give 1 r/hr
at 50 £t from_the center of the reactoro Such a shield is not far from being
both the lightest and the most compaet that has been devised. It will make
use of noncrltical materials that are in good supply, and it will provide use-
ful performance data on the effects on the radiation dose levels of the re-
lease of delayed neutrons and decay gammas in the heat exchanger, the gene-
ration of secondary gammas throughout the shield; etc. While the complica-
tion of detailed instrumentation within the shield does not appear warranted,

it will be extremely'worthwhile +to obtain radiation dose level data at repre-

sentative points around the periphery of the shield, particularly in the
vicinity of the ducts and of the pump and expansion tank region°

Several arrangements have been considered as means for dlsposing of the
heat generated in the reactor. The most promising of these is one that re-
sembles a turbojet power plant in many respects. It will employ radiators
essentially similar to those suitable for turbojet operation. Conventional
axial flow blowers will be used to force cooling air through the radiaters.
This arrangement will be flexible and as inexpensive as any arrangement de-
vised. It will give thermal capacities and fluid transit times essentially
the same as those in a full-scale aircraft power plant. It will also give
some very valuable experience with the operation of high-temperature liquid-
to-air heat exchangers that embody features of construction and fabricating
techniques suitable for alrcraft use.o

In an effort to minim:ze the llkllhood of important treubles developing
during the course of the test, an extensive series of cemponent development
tests has been initiated. These tests have been designed to establish sound
technigues for the fabricatlon ‘of pumps and heat eéxchangers and to provide
detail design information on such factors as clearances, etc. The operating
experience’ gained in the course of these tests should prove most helpful in

‘minimizing 0perating'trodb1es ‘with the ART and in diagnosing such troubles

as may develop. These component develcpment tests include experiments with

- a hot (high-temperature) critical agsembly which will consist of the pump,

header tank, and core system envisioned for the full-scale reactor. The ex-
pensive pressure shell and heat exchanger will not be included in this hot
eritical experiment. _

felt that there will probebly be a number of mechanical problems of construc-

.'by'rew0rking the first unit, it is to be ‘built as expeditiously as possible

ma. jor hazards would be much less serious than had at first been presumed.

 

f  Also, the use of circulating fuel with its high negative temperature coef-
ficient gives & reactor in which a nuclear exploS1on seems almost out of the

question. In order to operate the ART at Oak Ridge uhder the safest possible
conditions the entlre reactor system, with the exception of the NaK-to-air
radlators, will be enclosed in a cell conszsting of an inner tank within which

the reactor assembly will be installed and an outer water-filled tank. The
cell.vlll thus provide a water-filled annulus around the reactor assembly.

~ The very compact installation envisioned results in’'a Very low investment in
sodium and NakK (about 1/20 of that required for the KAPL-SIR reactor designed
- for the same power level). A relatively small amount of energy would be re-

'1eased.by reactions involving the llquld metals, and therefore a corre8pond~

ingly small-dlameter cell can be used. | , ?_7,

'amounts of energy that could be released in an extreme reactor catastrophe.

It will be impossible for a fragment ejected from the reactor assembly by an
explosion to rupture the inner tank of the cell because the pressure shell

surrounding the reactor has been deliberately designed to yield at a pressure

of 1000 psi and the maximum velocity of & fragment ejected at this pressure
would be substantially below that required to penetrate the cell wall. '

The 60-Mw reactor test unit was 6381gned orlginally to be operated ‘at
the National Reactor Testing Station (NRTS) at Arco, Idaho. It was envision-
ed that the reactor could be pretested at Oak Ridge and then shipped to MRTS
for the nuclear tests. waever, a survey disclosed that construction and
operation at NRTS would require at least six months longer than at Oask Ridge.
Delays would be occasioned by conducting a construction operation 2,000 =
miles away and any small difficulty that might arise in reactor operation

would be likely to introduce a major delay if that difficulty were not fore-

seen and plans to cope with it made in advance. No aelay'would be ocea -

sioned by construction of the small reactor assembly cell for use at the Oak
Ridge site, and approval is being requested from the Atomic Energy Commission
for operatlon of the Aircraft Reactor Tegt in such a cell at thg Qak Bldge. .

2. THE 'SHIELDED REAC_TOR ASSEMBLY -

g

The reactor is to be of the c1rculat1ng—fluoride-fuel, reflector- o
mﬂderated type. It will employ sodium-cooled beryllium as the reflector-
moderator material and is designed to operate at 60 Mw. The reactor assem-

- bly will include the pressure shell, reflector, fuel and sodium pumps, and

heat exchanger assenblies. The basic design is shown. 1n‘Flg. 2.1, a vertical

section through the reactor. A series of concentric shells, each of which is

a surface of revolution about the vertical axis, constitute the mejor portion
of the assembly. The two inner shells surround the fuel region at the center
(that is, the core of the reactor) and separate it from the beryllium island
and the outer beryllium reflector. The fuel circulates downward and outward
to the entrance of the spherjcal-shell heat exchanger that lies between the

" reflector shell and the main pressure shell. The fuel flows upward between
the tubes in the heat exchanger into the two fuel pumps at the top. From the

pumps, which operate in parallel, it is discharged inward to the top of the

. annular passage leading back to the reactor core. The fuel pumps are sump-
'~ type pumps with gas seals. A horizontal section through the pump volute
-~ region is shown in Fig. 2.2.. A schematic diagram of the reactor system is
- shown in Fig. 2.3. :

:RefleéﬁerModerator Cooling System

The reflector will be cooled by sodium circulated by two pumps at the
top of the reactor. The sodium will flow downward through passages in the
beryllium and back upward through the annular space between the beryllium
and the enclosing shells. The central beryllium island will be cooled in
& similar manner, except that the sodium will leave the bottom of the is-
land to be returned to the top of the reactor through cooling passages in
the main pressure shell. The sodium will return to the pump inlets through
small torrodial sodium-to-NaK heat exchangers around the outer periphery of
the pump-expansion tank region. The sodium pump and heat exchanger sub-
assemblies will be positioned on either side of the fuel pump volute region.
The pipe from the sodium pump discharge will make & slip fit into the re-
flector sodium inlet tube. The leakage through this slip fit into the sodium
return passage will simply recirculate with no penalty other than a small
increase in the required pump capacity.

Pressure Shell

The Inconel pressure shell will constitute both the main structure of
‘the reactor and a compact container for the fuel circuit. The design has
been modified somewhat from that shown in Fig. 2.1 to make the shell con-
tinuous through the vicinity of the headers and thus give better contimuity
of stress flow and & minimum of welding. Blisters made of l-in.-thick plate
uelded to the outer surface of the shell between the NaK pipes will serve
‘both to reinforce that weakened region and to provide for sodium flow up
through the shell. The imner liner assembly of the pressure shell will con-
51st of a 0. 75-in.-thick Inconel shell, a 0.125- in¢-thick hot-pressed Bhp

layer, and an inner 0 062-1n.-thick Inconel can. Heat generated in the
pressure shell by the absorption of gammas from the fuel will be removed
by sodium flowing between the outer surface of the liner and the iunner
surface of the pressure shell so that the pressure shell temperature will
be held close to 1200°F. A 0.062-in.-thick gap will provide ample flow

_'passage area for sodium to flow upward from the bottom of the island to

the top of the pressure shell. Transfer tubes there will direct the sodium
from the outer surface of the pressure shell to the sodium-to-NaK heat

Jexchanger 4inlets. The hot-pressed boron carbide blocks will be diamond-

shaped, with 60-deg angles at their vertexes, and they will have rabbeted
edges. This design mekes it possible to cover a spherical surface with a

‘single block size and shape. To facilitate welding in the final assembly,

the pressure shell will be split circumferentially at both 1°S and 35°N
latitudes. By splitting the liner at 1°S5 latitude, it will be easily ac-
cessible for weldlng, and the upper portion of the main shell can be lowered
1nto place for the final'weldlng operaﬁlons.

. ' The spherlcal—shell fuel»toANaK heat exchanger, which makes possible
the compact layout of the reacbor-heat exchanger assembly, is based on the

‘use of tube bundles curved in such a way that the tube spacing will be uni-

form, irrespective of latitude.l The individual tube bundles will terminate
in headers that resemble shower heads. This arrangement will facilitate

| assembly‘because 8 large number of small tube-to-header assemblies can be

made leak-tight much more easily than one large unit. Furthermore, these

 tube bundles will give a rugged flexible construction that will resemble

steel cable and will be admirably adapted to serviée in. wniﬂh large amounts
of dlfferentlal thermal expan31on must be expected. ’ _

Pumgs

_ " Two fuel pumps and two sodlum pumps are located a$ the tep of ﬁhe
reactor. These pumps are similar, but the fuel pumps have a larger flow
capacity, In addition to pumplng, the fuel pump will perform several other
functions. Most of the xenmon and krypton and probably some of the other
fission-product poisons will be removed from the fluoride mixture by scrub-

'~ bing it with helium as it is swirled and agitated in the expansion. tank.

The high swirl rate in the expansion tank is also desirsble in that the
centrifugal field will keep the free surface of the fuel reasonably stablé:
in maneuvers or in "bumpy" flight. The expansion chamber will also serve
as a mixing chamber for the addition of high-uranium-content fuel to the
main fuel stream %o enrlch the mixture and to compensate for burnup. Fluid
will be scooped from the vortex in the expan81on tank and directed into the
centrifuge cups on the backs of the impellers. Since considerably more fuel
will be scooped from the vortex than can be handled by the centrifuge, the

and returned to the expansion tank. There it will help maintain a high
rotational velocity. A slinger located on the pump shaft sbove the swirl
pump will prevent fuel from splashing up into the annulus around the shaft
below the seal.

A number of other special features have been included in the pump
design to adapt it to the full-scale reactor shield. The pump has been de-
signed so that it can be removed or installed as a subassembly with the
impeller, shaft, seal, and bearings in a single compact unit. This assembly
will fit into the bore of a cylindrical casing welded to the top of the re-
actor pressure shell, A 3-in. layer of uranium just above a l/2-1n. layer
of’th around the lower part of ‘the impeller shaft will be at the same level
as the reactor gamma shield Jjust outside the pressure shell., The space be-
tween the bearings will be filled with oil to avoid a gap in the neutron
shield. The pumps will be powered by d-c electrlc motors in order to provide
good speed control.

Shield

The shield for the reactor has some characteristics that are peculiar
to this particular reactor configuration. The thick reflector was selected
on the basis of shielding consideration. The two major reasons for using a
thick reflector are that a reflector about 12 in. thick followed by a layer
of boron-bearing material will attenuate the neutron flux to the point where
the secondary gamma flux can be reduced to a value about equal to that of the
core ‘gamma radistion. This thickness will also reduce The neutron leakage
flux from the reflector into the heat exchanger to the level of that from the
delayed neutrons that will appear in the heat exchanger from the circulating
fuel. An additional advantage of the thick reflector is that 99% of the
energy developed in the core will appear as heat in the high-temperature zone
included by the pressure shell. This means that very little of the energy
produced by the reactor musﬁ be disposed of with a parasitic cooling system
at a low temperature level. The material in the spherical-shell intermediate
heat exchanger is about 70% as effective as water for the removal of fast

f;neutrons so it too is of value from the shielding standpoint. The delayed
“neutrons from the cmrculating fuel in the heat exchanger region might appear

to pose ‘s serious ‘handicap.’ ‘However, these will have an attenuation length

' ‘much shorter than the corresponding attenuation length for radiation from

thexeore.,'"hps, from the outer surface of the shield, the intermediate heat
’chaager will appear ‘as a much less 1ntense source of neutrons than the

  

 'more’ deeply buried reactor core. The fission-product decay gammas from the

heat exchanger will be of about the same 1mportance as secondary gammas from
the beryllium and the pressure shell. -

' Asseﬂbly and Testlng

‘and leak tested in the Y-12 area. The whole assembly is designed so that
leak testing can be carrled ‘out as the components are added, piece by piece.

Mass spectrographic techniques will be used for leak testlng. The com-

pleted assembly of circulating-fuel and moderator-cooling systems can be

leak tested before it is moved to the site. All ‘thermocouples and other
1nstrumentation will be checked as the assembly proceeds.-* T

Assembly of the radlators, blowers, NaK pumps, £111 and draln tanks,'
and other auxiliary equipment will proceed concurrently with the assembly of

‘the reactor$at Bulldlng 7503. Cleaning and leak testing procedures will be

the same as those for the reactor. All instrumentation in the building will

' bé checked out, as far as possible, prior to installation of the reactor

package._

The reactor Shleld assembly (w1thout wamer in the Shleld)'Wlll ‘be moved
as a package from the Y-12 area to the 7503 building. After all connections
have been made, flnal leak testlng will be carried out.

The NaK system'wzll be Filled with NaK and, ‘with the beat ‘barrier doers

closed, the NakK pumps will be started. A heat input of approximately 300 kw
will be attained by circulation of the NaK, and this energy in the NeaK will
be used to preheat the reactor. The presence of leaks, if any, from the NakK
system to the fuel system will be determined at this time by a flame photo-
meter. In addition to the leak check, the circulation of NaK in the system
will permit the checkout of all instrumentation and the determination of the
system characteristics. After cireulation for several hours, the NaK will
be sampled and analyzed for oxygen content. If the oxygen content is within

the capacity of the purification system, the NaK will be left in the system

for the remainder of the test; otherwise it will have to be replaced. If
the NaK is to be replaced it will be dumped hot 1n order to carry the ox1de
W1th it. '

The sodlum system for cooling the berylllum Wlll be filled next, and
finally, the fuel system will be filled with a barren fluoride mixture.
Circulation of the fluids in these circults will permit final cleaning of
the systems, operational checks of instrumentation, and a determination of
the system operating characteristics. As with the NaK, samples will be
taken and analyzed for purity. The barren carrier will then be drained from
the fuel system and replaced with a fluoride mixture containing 80% of the
requlred‘uranlum (as determlnea from the crltlcal experlment)

Site

   

The AB.E facility, ORNL Building 7503, ‘a8 noted "'in the ARE Hazard.s Sum- -
mary Report,™ 1s located at a site 0.75 mile southeast of the center of the
present ORNL area and about 0.24 mile northeest of the Hemogeneous Reactor =
Test (HRT) facility. This ARE location is near the center of Melton Valley .
which is approximately 4 miles long and 0.5 mile wide. With the exception of
the nearby HRT, this valley is unoccupied. Between the ARE site {elevation |
840 £t) and Bethel Valley, which contains ORNL (elevation 820 £i), is Haw ;
Ridge which averages 980 £t in elevation. Within & radius of 1.9 miles, all 1
the land is owned by the AEC and is already a se@umtyucontrelled area. Within
a radius of 2. 3 ‘miles 'bhere 18 approximately C.3 square miles of farm land
. ‘that 1s not AEC owned or comtrolled. Additional information on the smounding
_'_'area. and the natural characteristice of the site:is. presented in Appendix A.

. To modify the"ARE Bua.lding to”"accomodate the ART, it is pla.nned that an

"addition to the south énd will be constructed to effect a 6h-t extension of

the present 105-ft long ‘building. The ART shielded reactor assem’oly and. its
container will be imstalled within this addition to the ARE Buildlng. Such an
arrangement will permit the use of ARE services and facilities that exist in o
‘this installation wh:a.ch has now gerved the purpose for which it was erected.
""" For example, {tems such a@ the control voom, offices, change rooms, toilets,
storage area, water supply, power supply,, portwns of experimental test pite;
access roads, security fencing, and security lighting are available for in-
corporation in ART planso Fig. 3.1 shows the preliminary degign of the facil-
ity in perspec tlve. TR T T T AR | |

 

 

    

The pla.n a.nd ‘eleva'bmn wings of the ART f’aeillty are ‘shawn in F':z.gs. ok
SR 3 .2 and 3.3. The floor level of the addition will be at the ARE basement o
- floor grade (ground level at this end of ‘the building), and the cell for

housing the reactor assembly “will be supk in the floor up to 3 £t below the E
L bolting-flange 1eVel. The resctor cell will be loeated in approximately the .é
center of the he-f't wide by 6h-Pt long higha‘bay extension and. directly in L

- line with the ARE experlmental bay. The reactor assembly will be positione&

- so that the top of the shield will be at the building floor elevation.

aﬁd.possibly for underwater reactor disassembly work after resctor oper-
ation. Also, the truck door in the north wall of the ARE Building will
be enlarged to provide & large entry door to the ART arsa.

Field maintenance and 1aboratory facilitles will Dbe 1nstalled in the
area east of the new bay and south of the low bay of the ARE. This area
and the old expérimental bay will be partitlioned from the new bay with
gbout & 16-in.-thick solid, concrete-block shield wall. This wall will
not be erected until after placement of the upper sections of the reactor
assembly container. The only other major modification to the ARE facility
to accommodate the  ART will be that of modifying and equipping one of the

 ARE experimental pits for underwater disassembly work on the reactor after

operation.
Reactor Cell

. The cell designed for housing the reactor assembly is shown in

Fig. 3.4. As may be seen, the cell is to consist of an inner and an outer
tank. The heat dump equipment will be located outside the cell, but nearby.
The space between the two tanks will be of the order of 18 in. and will be
filled with water. The inper tank will be sealed so that it can contain
the reactor in an inert atmosphere of nitrogen.at atmospherie pressure, but
it will be built to withstand presgures of 100 psi, The outer tank will be
merelyaa water contalner. ‘ .

The inner tank will bu approx1mately 2# ft in dlameter with a stralght
section about 11 £t long and a hémispherical bottom and top. The outer '
tank, which is to be cylindrical, will be approximately 27 £t in diameter
and about 47.5 ft high. When the reactor is to be operated at high power, -
the space between the tanks and above the inner tank will be filled with
water so that in the event of an accident so severe as to cause a meltdown

- of the reactor the heat given off by the decay gamma act1v1ty will be car-
ried off by the water. Since the heat transfer rate-to water under boiling

- - conditions would- be exceedlngly high (of the order of 320,000 Btu/hre ££2)
-+ and since the thermal conductivity of the fluoride fuel is relatively low,
. the water-szde temperature ‘of the inner tank will not exceed the water tem-
. perature by more than 4OCF. The water capacity of the space between the
- tanks together with the water in the reservoir above the inner tank (ap-
ﬁiq{proximately 10 £t deep) will be of the order of 1,000,000 gal. ' Boiling of
. .. the water in the annulus and above the inner tank will sufflce to carry
S off all the heat generated by the “fission products after any acc1dent with—
,Hfjout any additional water being supplled to the tank°

\/

 
 
  

the space inside the tank will be shielded fairly well so that it will be
possible for a man to enter the inner tank through a manhole for inspection
or repair work, even if the reactor has been run at moderately high power.

L _ ”‘will be above floor grade. This portion
of t ertank, ag well as the top hemisphere of the inner tank, will not be
- attached until completion of the reactor installation and preliminary shake-
~ down testlng.' Since the shielding at the reactor will be quite effective,

The unshielded reaetor assembly will weigh approximately 10,000 Ib, the
lead gamma shield, approximately 30,000 1b; and the water in the shield, ap-
proximately 34,000 1b. The first two of these items can be handled conven-

iently with a 20-ton crane, while the borated water will be pumped in after

the rdbber tanks have been Lnstalled for the water shleld.

- The reactor assembly, with lts aireraftutype shleld will be mounted
in the inner tank on vertical columms with the reactor off-center from the
vessel axis and about 6 ft above an open-grated floor. This pos1tioning .
will provmde the space needed for movement of the portable fluoride fuel and
sodium moderator coolant containers to their operating stations under the re-
actor. The off-center location will also serve to minimize the length of the

NaK plplnga ‘
The NaK and off-gas plping connected £0 the reactor will pass through a

thlmble-type passage or bulkhead in the double-walled cell. The openings

will be covered with stiff plates which will be welded to the tank walls.
The piping will be anchored to the inner plate and connected with a bellows-
type seal to the outer one. The volume within all bulkheads will then be
malntalned at a pressure above that of the inner tank to prevent out- leakage

from the inner tanko

A doubly-sealed Junction panel for controls, 1nstrumentation, and
aux11iary services will be installed through the tank below the building
floor grade as a part of another bulkhead to pass wires, pipes, tubes, etec.,
reqguired for the circuits and systems. The various thermocouples, power
wiring, ete., .will be installed on the reactor assembly in the shop and fit-
ted with disconnect plugs so that they can be plugged into the panel in a
short period of time after the reactor assembly has been lowered into position
in the test facility. This will minimizé the amount of assembly'work re-
quired“in'the'field.” o

Two more bulkheads, in the form of manholes, will be installed in the

‘ upper portlon of the contalner.” Ore manhole will be about 3 ft by 5 £t and

located just above the flange on “the inner tank to allow passage through

_ ;:both container walls and thns provide an entrance to the inner tank for use =
,‘after placement ‘of the’ upper “sections of the containero_ The second opening

will be a manhole gbout 5 ft.in diameter in the hemispherical top of the

- inner container to prov1de overhead crane service after placement of . the top.

Sufficient catwalks, ladders, and hoistlng equipment will ba installed withln
the inner tank to provide easy ‘access for servicing all equipment.

The control bulkhead in the cell will be located so that the assoclated »'

control junction panel and the ‘control tunnel will extend to the auxiliary
equipment pit (formerly the ARE storage plt) The pit and basement equip-

- ment will inelude such items as the lubricating oil pumps and coolers,

borated shield water make-up and fill tank with a transfer pump, vacéuum pump,
relays, switch gear, and emergency power supply. The reactor off-gas flow,
diluted with helium, will be piped through the NaK.plping bulkhead to the
disposal facility outside the building.

" Heat Dump System

 

 

 

-20.

 

The ha31c requirement of the ART heat dump system is to prov1de heat
dump capacity equivalent to 60 Mw of heat with a mean temperature level of
1300°F in the NeK system. It has also seemed desirable that the ART heat
dump system should simulate the turbojet engines of the full-scale aircraft
in a number of important respects, such as thermal inertla, NakK holdup, and
f&bricational methods.

Slnce heat dumps are required for use in heat exchanger test rlgs, and
since work of this character ‘has already progressed to the point where the
cheapest ‘most’ compact, "and most convenient heat dump is. currently proving
to be a round-tube and plate-fin radiator core, 1t is believed that this
basic type of heat transfer surface should prove both’ sufficiently relisble

and sufficiently'well-tested to serve for the ART. The round-tube and plate-

fin radietor planned for the ART makes use of type 310 stainless steel clad

" copper fins spaced 15 per inch and mounted on 3/16-in.-0D tubes placed on

2/%-in. square centers. Individual radiator cores will have an inlet face.
2 ft squareal Mueh information has been dbtalned in tests of 51mllar unlts.

Sl -

HaK w1ll be clrculated through five separate systems.' Four will con-

stitute the main heat dump system, while the fifth will be the moderator

heat dump system. In the main heat dump system a group of four fill-and-
drain tanks will be used, but these will not require the remotely operable

- couplings desired for the sodium or fuel systems. The NaK will be forced |
into the main cooling circult by pressurizing the tanks. The 2k tube hundles‘

of the ‘fuel-to-NaK heat exchanger will be manifolded in four groups of six
each. The NaK will flow from these tube bundles out to the radiators which
will be arranged in Pour vertical banks with four radiator cores in each bank.

The NaK will flow upward through the radiator bank to the pumps . A small by-f

pass flow through the expansion tank will allow it to serve as a cold trap.
A filter to remove oxides will be placed in the return line from the tank.

- The moderator heat dump system will be essentially similar except that
its capacity will be about one-~quarter that of one of the fow circults of
the main heat dump system. NeK will be circulated to the Na-to-NeK heat ex-
changer in the top of the reactor where the NaK will pick up from the
sodium the heat generated in the island and reflector. The NaK will pass.
to & small NaK-to-air radiator where it will be cooled and returned to the

pump suction. An expansion tank and by-pass filter will be ‘included, as in

the main NaK system. It is planned to have only drain and filter by-pass

throttle valves iri the NakX systems, since the NaK w1ll be drained if any ‘: f'

repalrs are requlred°

As shown iu Flg. 3.2, ‘the NaK-tb-air radistors will be mounted in an
air duct close to the reactor cell° This duct traverses the southwest cor-

ner of the bulldlng addition. The radmators Wlll be located at floor grade‘””'

_23-

over the NaK pipe-llne pit° Four axial-flow blowers will force 300 000 cfm |

of air through the radiators and out through a 10-ft-dia discharge stack T8
ft high. Since the axial-flow blowers will stall and surge if throttled,
control can be best accomplished through by-passing a portion of the air

'”around the radlatorso' This arrangement required only constant speed a-c

motors and simple duct work with a controlleble louvre for by-passing. The

~ heat dump rate will be modulated by varying the number of blowers in oper-

ation. A set of counterweighted self-opeming louvre vanes in the inlet or
dlscharge ‘duet from esch blower Will prevent backflow through the blowers
not in operatlono Thus each blower will be driven with an a-c¢ motor inde-
pendently of the others, and the heat dump capacity can be increased dn in-
erements of 25% from zero to full load. An additional % £t by 8 £t set of
controllable louvres will be mounted in such & way as to bleed air from the
plenum chamber between the blowers and the radiators to get vernier control

of the heat load.

!

Heat barrlers mounted on either side of the radiators will be requlred
to mlnlmlze heat losges during the warmup operations. Warmup will be accom-
pllshed by-energlzlng ‘the ‘pumps and driving them at part or full speed.

' Since approximately 400 hp must be put into the pumps in the NaK circuits,
this power will appear as heat in the fluld pumped as a result of flubd

frictional losses. A mechsnical power input of 400 hp to the NeK pumps will

produce a heat input in the NeK system of approximately 300 kw. This should

be enough to heat the system quite satisfactorily with the radiator cores
‘blanketed to ‘prevent excessive heat losses. Relatively simple sheet stain-

- less steel ‘doors filled with 0.5 in. of thermal insulation when closed over

both faces of & radiator (6h ft2 inlet-face area) filled with llOOOF NeX will
give a heat 1oss of 30 kw.

Heat load control for the low-power range ‘presents some problems. The
plenum chamber préssure with the 4 £t by 8 ft by-pass louvres wide open and.
one blower on will be about 0.5 in. HyO.- This will give a heat dump capa-
city of 3 Mw if all the radigtor he barriers are opened. Lower heet

the radiation level can be cut for maintenance operations. Easy installa—

: For handling the heavy, shielded fluoride and sodium contalners in 1de¢
the pressure vessel, a track will be installed on the floor and 1n51de the
wall. Wheels will be mounted on the tank dolly, both on the bottom and on.
one ‘end, so that the assembly can be lowered by the overhead crane to the
floor track with the end wheels on the dolly rolling against the vertical

track. Once on the floor track, each dolly will be moved to its operating

station under the reactor° Fach track pair in this area will be mounted on

‘a 1lift for raising ‘the tank connection nozzle to the contaet positlon w1thin -
_the reactor shield.

o et
Other requirements of the fill-and-drain system include provision for _
accurate measurement of the quantity of fluld in the drain tank at all times
during either the filling or the draining operation. This is particularly
important in connection with reactor fuel systems because it is important

that the'exact amount of fuel in the reactor be known at all times.

. The shielding required for the fuel tank will be 10 in. of 1ead to re-
duce the dose to 1 r/hr at 5 £t from the tank one week after full-power
operation. The resulting shield weight for a T7- ft3-capacity tank will be
about 15 tons. The lead shield required for the 1- £t0 sodium drain tank
will be 5 in. thick, and it will weigh approximately 2 tons.

Fill and drain systems for fuel or for sodium from the moderator circuit
will include provision for both preheat and the removal of decay gamma heat.
These functions will be carried out by diverting NaK from the radiator cir-
cuits and directing it through a jacket surrounding the drain pipe and
through coils in the drain tank.

i Off-Gas DlSpOSal System

The design of the off-gas system was based on the pessimistic assump-

| tion that all the fission products will be given up to the off-gas system

as they are formed and will be swept out with 1000 liters of helium per
day. They will be passéd through a long charcoal-filled pipe designed so

‘that no more than 0.COLl curie/sec of radioactivity will go up the stack.

About # Mw of the 60 Mw will appear as fission-product decay energy. Since
the design was based on all of the fission products being released to the

off-gas system, a decay of t™V*< was used in calculating the heat released.

~ The gases will be removed from the fuel in the expansion tank at the
top of the reactor and vented through a 1/4% in. Inconel line 20 ft long
to a 2-in. steel pipe 1050 £t long. The first 50 £t of this pipe will be

”open, but the balance w1ll be filled with activated charcoal. The gas

Since about 0.5 Mw of heat will be given up by the fission products on
the charcoal, the limiting factor will be the heat transfer. Upon entering
the charcoal, the gas will be absorbed very rapidly, and the first few feet
of charcoal will soon rise in temperature to around LOOCF. The temperature
will start to decrease in less than 10 ft, and, -by the time the gas has passed
through about 100 ft of charcoal, the temperature will be down to near the |

ok, ccamom AI\ID OPERATION

Control éﬁilésophy

The early ORNL effort to develop the circulating-fuel type of aircraft
reactor wvas motivated in part by a desireble control feature of such
reactors. Thls feature is the inherent stability at design point of the
over-all power plant that results from the negative fuel temperature coef-
flcéent\of reactivityo In a power plant with this characteristic the
nuclear power source is a slave to the turboaet load with a mlnimum of exter»
nal control dev1ces.vllv oo

This predlcted master-elave relationshlp hetween the lead and pewer
source was verlfled by the ARE. Controlwise the power plant consists of
the nnclear source, ‘the heat dump (in the case of ART), and the coupling
between source and sink (the NaK 01rcu1t) Control at design point can be
effected to some extent by nuclear means at the reactor, by changing the
coupling (i.e., changing the NaK flow), or by chenglng the load (i.e., the
heat dump from the NaK radiators)

_ For the ART at design point the regulatlng rod will be used mainly for
adjusting the reactor mean fuel temperature. In particular, an upper tem-
perature limit will cause the regulatlng rod to insert until the fuel out-
let température does not exveed 1600 ¥. This 1imit will override any normal
demand for rod withdrawal. Furthermore & low NakK outlet temperature from
the heat dump ‘radiators will sutomatically decrease the heat load to keep
the lowest NaK temperature of the system at no less than 1050°F. This lower
temperature limit will overrlde all ether demands for power»

_ Critlcal experlments will be performed W1th the system 1setbermal at
. 1200°F. Thls temperature ‘was chosen to incredse the life expectancy of the

f_j;beryllium moderdtor. The méan fuel tenperature at design point will be
. 1%000F, thé moderator being held at 1200CF. Since the fuel temperature
| coefficient is 5 x 10 = per °F, 1.0% Ak/k will be required to raise the
‘mean fuel temperature this 200°F» ‘

manual change in load demand or in qperatlng temperature will be restricted
by the meximum rate at which the load can be changed or by the maxinum
rate at which the regulating rod can be withdrawn, respectively. In the
design point power range the maximum rate of withdrawal of the regulating
rod will be obtained by adding Ak/k at the rate of 3.33 x 10~* per second.

This will raise the fuel outlet temperature at the rate of 12°F per second

until the meximum fuel outlet temperature of 1600°F is reached, at which

- point the temperature limit will hold. In this range a permissible load
‘change rate of one-half design point power In 1 min is comparable to the

requirements of engine performance for a nuclear-powered aircraft. Load

Control of the ABT is classzfled in three dlfferent categorles of
operation: namely, (1) startup, (2) operation between startup and design
point, and (3) operation in the design point range. For the second and
third of these categories the nature of the reactor and power plant is so
different from that of conventional high flux reactors that control mnst

be based on inherent characteristics of the resctor to a large extent rather

than on conventional reactor conmtrol art. There is no conventional art for
these categories with high flux reactors. Control at startup utilizes, in

. principle, old reactor control art with short-period "scrams! that are con-

ventiénal in princlple. Exyerimentation will take place primarily in the
startup and design-point regions. In the intermediate region between these

- two, little testing will take place. Consequently, operational procedure
will be followed to take the reactor from the low-level adeguately control-

led region to the high levél region in one simple manner. This procedure
will be assured by permissive instrument t interlocks that are described in

a following sectlon of thls chapter.

 

Agvf»"*

Fissionﬂchambers and compensated fon chambers Will,be located beneath%if°¢"

the reactor shell between the fill and dump tanks and the reactor. The

' reglon ‘around the pipes between these tanks and the reactor will be filled |

with moderator material, either Be or BeQO, through which cylindrical holes
for théseé chambers will run radially out from the centerline of the systen.
From féur to six such holes will be available. Chanber Sensit1v1t1es will
be adequate for the entlre range of nuclear operatlono

- The fuel expan51on chamber is a key item in prov1ding safety for the |

ART. The fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity provides stability

for the system by the expansion of fuel from the eritical reglon._‘Adeqnate

Scram System

A conventional scram system achleved‘by droyping Poison rods into the o

critical lattlce will not be used with the ART. The reasons for elimina— ‘
ting this feature are “the follow1ng '

1. In the de31gn-point range described, analysis shows that llmlting
the rate of rod withdrawal and the rate of load increase will limit the -
period of the reactor when it is operating normally. A limited rate of

‘rod w1thdrawal and a limited rate of load increase near the design point

in the ARE gave s minimum perlod of about 10. sec.. The same technlque will be

used on ﬁhe ARTo

Short periods, of the order of 1 sec, can occur in the design—point
range only in the event of structural failure. The total Ak/k required in

" the rod to override an increase resulting from such failure cannot be ob-

tained from.one rod nor could such a rod, were it available, be inserted
fast enough to prevent s serious accident. The temperature coefficient will
react so rapidly “that it will limit the signal which would normally actuate
a scram, ‘except for an extremely high rate of increase in reactivity. It
hag not been 90531ble to devise a control system that would react rapidly
enough in such cases.to prevent the accident. Therefore, in the deS1gn—
point reglon the conventional scram would be of little merlt.

-8 For the'lnitlal 1oading and crltlcal experlments a scram system will.
be used, “but it Wlll not {avolve dropping the one control rod. The method
described below was’ ‘proposed because the single-rod system lacks the safety
feature of a plurality of rods, as ordinarily found in conventional reactors.

The actuating signal will be a short period, & high flux, a menual scram, or

any of & number of failures in the system, and the signal will be supplled

- through an auction circult in the conventional manner.

Essentlally, the safety of the system lies in the procedure of adding

_fuel in a subcritical external loading tank and forcing it against gravity

into ths fuel systemo This will be done by pressurizing the loading tank
with hellum.through a valve which will fail closed. Two parallel helium ‘
outlet 11nes frem the loadlng tank to the off-gas system will fail open. All
1oad1ng tank and the reactor locked open, and the signal from the auction
circult will actuate the solenoid in the helium-pressurizing system in the
menner described’ ‘above. Actually; two parallel dump lines, one to the £ill-
and—draln tank and one to the emergency dump tank, will contain valves which
will be ‘actuated smmultaneously on the dump signal from the auction amplifier

. clrcult. Thls system ‘has the merit that if too rapid addition of fuel to the

system’ causes & short period, reversal of the operation will reverse the perlod°
Control of the hellum,pressurizing system will limit the rate at which the fuel

Startup

- A rather close estimate of the crltieal concentratlon shoald be avall-
ablé from the hot critical experiment so that 80% of the uranium will be in
the fuel at the time of the ART startup. ' The fimnal 20% of the required
uranium will be added in steps. After each uranium addition the fuel will
be forced frem the £ill tank up into the reactor by'means of helium pres-
sure. The scram czrcumt will be available, ag described previously. The
rod will be inserted for each step, s glven smount of uranium will be added,
the rod will be slowly withdrawn, and a count will be taken on the fission
chambers to determlne the suberitical multiplication as a function of uranium
concentration° ‘A polonium-beryllium source of approximately 15 curies strength

. will be 1nstalled 1n tha Pentral 1sland of the reactor to provide neutrons

With all loop flow rates at design point and the reactor at &bout 10

the reactor is on a positlve period. This period will gradually increase
Cuntil it becomes infinite and finally negative because of the temperature

go through a maximum. This meximum log N reading will provide the signal
+to permit opening of the heat barrier doors to the NaK radiators. Natural
convection from the radiators with these doors open will be about 300 kw.
'Accordlngly if these doors are opened when the log N reading reaches this
value, the température coefficient will always suffice to provide regula-
tion and stability, provided the rate of load demand above this mlnlmum
is restrlcted tq the value 01ted previously¢'  :
If after shutdown the flux exceeds the log N reading requlred to open
the heat barriers; opening of the barriers will not "shock" the system
even though the reactor may'be suberitical at the time the doprs are
opened. If on the other hand ‘the flux is too low to permit opening of the
barriers, there 1s only one precedure for getting perm1651on. -

De51gn-P01nt Qperation

 

Wlth the reactor at about 500 kw (estimated from the power extracted
by opening the heat barrier dcors) the blowers will be started and heat
will be extracted from the NaK, which, in turn, will extract heat from
the fuel. The reactor will be leveled out at 3, 15, 30, and 60 Mw. A
heat balance will be obtained at each level of extracted power vs nuclear
power. The Qperation of all components will be observed at each power level.

. Care will be taken not to exceed the maximum temperature of 1600°F .or fall
‘below the minimum temperature of 1150°F. : The reactor will then be operated
for 1000 hr at 60 Mw.

Xenon will be removed contlnuously from the fuel by hellum injected
into the pump chamber and escaping in the swirl chamber. The rate of re-

..moval by this means can be determined only by operating the power plant.

However, experience with the ARE has indiestéd that less then 1% Ak/k of

regulating rod will be needed to cope with the xenon that is not re-

m eq. Should the purging be much less than is anticipated, the xenon

€0 w&iand would under some circumstences shut the reactor down. The low-

An attempt has been made to envision as many hazards as possible that
might occur during the course of the operation of the Aircraft Reactor Test.
Included in this chapter, therefore, is a discussion of . the normal radi-
ation hazards, the hazards resulting from operational or equipment failures,
and fluid leaks, as well as the nuclear and chemical hazards peculiar to the
cycle. The dispersion of airborme activilty, either from the ‘off-gas system
or following a hypothetical accident in which all the fuel is volatillzed,
is described in the’ follewzng chapter, "Dispersmon of Alrborne Activ1ty.

The radloactivlty of the ART will be 1nherently conflned‘by the nature
of the design and materials in such a manner that the uncontrolled disper-
sion of the activity outside the resctor cell will be virtually impossible.
Consequently, the hazard from most failures will be negligible, since the o
only action required will be dumping of the fuel; the activity would not

‘even be released to the cell. Furthermore it is shown that wh;le a hypo-

thetical nuclear accident could rupture the reactor pressure shell, the reac-

'tor cell Wmuld remain 1ntact and the accldent would he safely contalned.

Some con31derat10n'has been glven to cases in whlch the reactor cell,
as well as the pressure shell, would be ruptured, and the resulting subse-
quent d;sper51on of activity has been examined in detail. It is believed
that such an accident could occur only as the result of aerial bomblng or
sabotage. : _

Radlatlon Dose Levels

The radiation dose levels to be expected at representative stations ab
the facility have been estimated for a variety of conditions and have been
tabulated in Table 5.1. 'The shielding assumed for these egtimates was the
following: (1) the primary airchaft-type reactor shield designed to give

- 1 rem/hr at 50 £t at full power, (2) the reactor cell steel and water walls,
=1 (3) 16 in. of concrete block stacked around the reactor cell to a height of
10 ft, (4) 16. in of concrete block stacked between fhe reactor room and
 ‘the maintenance shop and between the reactor room and the former ARE main

section are listed those failures which would have the greatest effect on
the operation and which therefore seem to offer the greatest hazards. For
each failure some probable ceuses are given, as well as the resulk, and the
action reqnlred in order to minimize the hagzard is stated. In all cases,

~as will be shown, the faillure would be inconvenient, but no serious danger
would ensue, since the most drastic action required would be dumping of the
fuel (and/or sodium) into the dump tanks. Therefore it is also apparent

products; hot, highly radiocactive fuel and abiendant decay heat; and NaK.

Fuel Channel Hot Spots. Flow separation in the core or fallure of
the core-shell coolant system could cause hot spols in the fuel channel.
In this event there would be the possibility of fuel boiling in the core
and causing irregularities in power or increased corrosion. The powver
level would be reduced until the fuel boiling ceased, or, if necessary,

the fuel wou.ld. be é.um;ped.

Exaessive ‘Puel Feed. A failure in the ‘enrichment system might result

in the addition of excess fuel. In this event the reactor would heat to a

new and higher equilibrium temperature. An excess of 0.6 1b of URD) intro-
duced instantaneously would make the reactor prompt critical. A Ak./k of
0.002 would oceur and result in an immediate fuel temperature rise of LO°F,
The reactor would qulc}ﬂ.y level out at the new temperature., If the equi-
librium temperature were excess:.ve » the fuel would. be dumped.

Fuel Flllwa.nd-])raln ..:;,rs’cem Failure. The fuel fill-and-drain system

might fall because of jammed valves or a coolant system failure. If such

a failure occurred before the fuel was enriched, there would be no hazard.
The system would be repaired, if possible, or the nonradicactive fuel would
be dra:.ned on the floor of the reactor cell. In the event of an emergency
drain of radiocactive fuel coincident with a failure of the fill-and=drain
system that prevents drainage, the reactor will fail at the weakest point
and release hot fuel, fission products, sodium, and NaK in the reactor cell.

" If the drain system functioned satisfactorily but the dump tank cooling sys-

tem failed after the fuel was drained, the tank would fail at its weakest
point and release large quantities of hot fuel and fission products to the
reactor cell. The reactor cell is designed to contain the hot, radicactive
fuel y as described in a follemng section. If it were desired to drain the
rad:.oactz_ve fuel under normal operating conditions and drainage was pre-
vented, it would be necessary to cool the radiocactive fuel with the normal
heat removal system until the decay heat had dropped sui‘flc:.ently to permit

shutdown of the NaK system. |

by radiographic techniques, as well as by prellmnary test:.ng, any leaks

crack. Corrosion is far more probable and is of particular concern, largely
because of the uncertainties associated therewith.

The corrosion process is discussed in‘Apyendixrc.' From the test data

included there, it is estimated that the corrosion penetration in the hot

zone of the ART would be of the order of 15 to 18 mils if no reductious,
in comparison with present experlence, can be effected in the corrosion

rate. The wall thicknesses to which the fuel is to be exposed will be
125 mils in the core and 25 mils in the heat exchanger.- In the core the

wall thickness is believed to be ample; in the heat exchanger the metal
would sustain a steep temperature gradient because of cooling by the NekK
s0 thet the penetrations given above may not @pply. However, should com-
ponent tests fail to justify this assumption; heavier tubing will be used.

If a leak, elther from corrosion or fatlgue, did occur, various chemi-
cal reactions could occur between the fuel and the Na or NeX, dependlng upon
the fuel composition, the size of the leak, and whether the leak was into or
out of the fuel system. The consequences of the chemical reactions from
each of 16 distinct leak conditions are also discussed in Appendix C. It
is apparent that the resulting hazards are dependent upon the assumptions

‘made regardlng the leak size, extent of completion of the reaction, and the

pre01p1tat10n of inmsoluble partlcles. The most severe case 1mag1nable is
discussed in a follcw1ng sectlon ‘entitled "Accidents Causing Rupture''of the
Pressure Shell." The probable consequences are, however, much less severe
and are discussed below. The action taken in each case would be to dump
the fuel and the subseqpent hazards would be small

Fuel Leak in cOre, Slnce the fuel pressure is malntalned below that of
the sodlum, a core leak would most probably result in the addition of sodium
to the fuel. The sodium would dilute the fuel mixture and, in the reaction
of sodium with the fuel, UF5 would be produced. The reactlon could continue
ubtil metallic uranium was produced, which, in turn, would be deposited in
the hotter part of the system (i.e., between the core and the heat exchanger).

 

This situation would be handled by dumping the fuel--no hazard'would ensue. .

On the other hand, if the fuel were to leak into the sodium in the
moderator region, the result would be more serious.because such a leak would
certainly allow excess uranium to be present in the core region. In this
event, the fuel would be dumped as soon as poss1ble.

Fuel Leak Into the Heat Exchanger. A leak in the ‘heat exchanger wculd

'--éither admit fuel into the NaK system or vice versa. A fuel lesk into the

NaK system would increase the activity outside the primsry shield, while a
NaX leak into the fuel system might result in excess uranium in the core.

‘Either of these situations would be undesirable, but it is now felt that a

fuel leak into the NaK system would be the more hazardous; therefore -the
pressure of the Na2K in the hest exchanger will be maintained higher than
that of the fuel in the fuel system.

Accordlngly, a leak in the heat exdhanger would.probably result in NaK
enterlng the fuel. As with sodium, UFz would be formed and the fuel mix-
ture would be diluted. Eventually urahium would be formed and would be de-
posited in the hotter section of the system. - This situation would e
handled by dumping the fuel and no hazard would result.

‘"It has been possible to conceive of two extreme situations which
appear t0 establish an upper limit on the rate at which the reactivity
could increase. They are as follows: (1) fuel abruptly begins to pre-
cipitate out in the core and the fuel stream enters the core at the nor-

- mal rate but no uranium leaves in the exit stream, and (2) fuel abruptly
enters the moderator cooang passages ‘replacing the sod;umdn A third

. situation~~one in whlch the ‘beryllium reflector melts and mixes unlformly
with the fuel--was examined, but it developed that this accident would
not give nearly as large a rate of increase in keff ‘because the high heat
capacity of the Peflector would keep the berylllum from melting rapidly.
The rate of temperature rise in the portion adjacént to ‘the fuel region
would be only 20°F/sec at 60 Mw. The two most severe accidents are dis-
cussed below. In addition, the vulnerability of the redctor cell to pene-
tration by pressure shell fragments, if the pressure shell were to rupture
as a consequence of other ac01dents, is examzned.

 This accldent ‘has been considered analytically in Appendix D and by

a nﬁmsrical a@proadh in Appendix E. The results of the btwo methods are

this type of accident the pressure shell is ruptured only if the reactivity

~is increased at a rate higher than that corresponding to half the rate-at which

 fuel s weuld.be pumped into the core, If the pressure shell should rupture, ’

- the reactor fuel, and sodlum'would.be spewed into the shield where they would
‘mix and’ react with éach other and with:‘the -shield water..:The resulting

chemical resctions are discussed in Appendix B. As may be seen in this
Appendlx all the chemlcal reactions may be contained, with the possible ex-
ceptlon of the case discussed in a following section in which there is an

~alr atmosphere in the reactor cell and a hydrogen explosion becomes a

possibility.

~ then kbat of the.fuel in the core, fuel would énter the moderator region

in the event ef a core shell leak. It has been assumed that as a conse~

 quence of unforseeable events an abrupt rupture of the reflector shell close
to the core inlet would begin to discharge fuel into all the cooling pess--

ages through the beryllium at a rate equivalent to that given by the sodium
velocity. While the cooling passages would probably plug close to their

- inlets it is interesting to construct the probable course of the accident

if it is assumed that mno plugging occurs, The initial fuel velocity through
the passages would be about the same as that for the sodium, i.e., 30 fps.
Because off the higher density of the fuel, its velocity would fall off as it
penetrated the reflector. The worst case would be that in which the fuel
entered all the coolant passages simultaneously, thus giving the maximum

~ rate of increase in reactivity. The initial fuel veloclity through the re-

flector would give a transit time of about 1/7 sec, or about 1/7 of the
corresponding value for the core. The volume of these passages is about
0.16 ft5 as compared with 3 £t in the core. The increase in Kepp if fuel
filled the passages in the reflector and island has been computed to be
0.09.- The average power density in the fuel in the reflector was calculated
to be six ‘times that in the core. This would make the average rate of tem-

perature rise in the reflector fuel about equal to that for the fuel in the

core, However, the rate of temperatmre rise at the nose of the fuel columns
in regions of high importance would be at least twice the average so that:

~ the rate of temperature rise there should.be at least twmce the awerage

value 1n.the core.

, Calculatlons were made for this case, except that the raie of 1ncrease
in keopr was taken to be twice as great to give a truly extreme case. In
this instance the power was found to rise to about 6000 Mw in about 80 msec,

at which,301nt the fuel in the beryllium would begin to boil. The pressure

in the reflector cooling passages would rise sbruptly to about 500 psi, the
erl.would.be expelled from them in ebout 10 msec, and, at that point, the
core fuel would have reached a temperature of about 300°F above nermal the

. Ireactar Wbuld then be on a 20~msec negative perlod.

ThlS veloc:ty of 215 fps is certaanl& a reasoaable one and should not glve '
any particular trouble., It is also 1m@ortant because it represents the
maximum possible velocity of a fragment that mlght be broken out of the pres—
sure shell in the event of a hydrostatic rupture. This velocity has ‘to be
compared with the velocity required to penetrate the l/2-in.‘wall of the en-
closure. As discussed in Appendix F, the penetrating power of projectiles
varies with their shape, hardness, strength, mass, and velocity, with a
6-in. casteiron sphere giving a rough standard for this case. As shown in
Appendix F, the velocity for penetration of l/2-1n. steel plate by such a
sphere is roughly 380 fps. Since the pressure shell is designed to rupture
at the bottom, and since the shielded drain tanks for the fuel and sodium
will be carried on a substantial floor 1mmed1ately under the reactor; the
tank bottom is well protected from any pressure shell fragments, ‘particu=

S larly 51nce ‘only small fragments could have a velocity as high as 215 fps.
. Thus it is clear that, even in the most pessimistic case, penetration of
© the cell wall 1s out of the question; even if no account is taken of the

energy loss of ‘the fragment durlng 1ts travel through the lead and water.

 

 

It was demonstratedwln the precedlng ‘section that the reactor cell will

dents. If it is postulated that one ‘such nuclear accident mey coincide with

- ‘the production of ell the heat that could possibly be released from the
" chemical combinations of various materials in the Tédctor and in an oxygen
"atmesphere, ‘enough additional energy-would‘be available to give still higher

cell pressures and possibly rupture the reactor cell As pointed out in the
previous section, since the chemical reacttons are more serious with an oxy-

nitrogen. The oxygen concentratlon will be monitored, and the instrumen-~
tation will be interlocked (durlng power operation) to dump the fuel when-
ever the oxygen concentration is greater than l% Tt then appears that the
only means by which both the pressure shell and the. reactor cell could be

‘ruptured simultaneously would be as a result of bomb damage. The possi-

bilitles of such a bombing, either by sabotage or aserial bombing, are re-
mote. The principle hazard associated with the simultaneous rupture of the
reactor pressure shell and cell would be from the dispersion of the activity.
This is dlscussed in the following chapter on “Dlsper31on of Airborne
Act1V1ty, ‘

Hydrogen EXploélon. In considering the various chemical reactions (see

 

"Appendlx B), one way that the reactor cell might conceivably be ruptured

would be by a hydrogen explosion following the reaction of the sodium or NaK

, w1th water in an air atmosphere. As mentioned above, nitrogen is to be main~-

talned'w1thin the reéactor cell once any apprecisble radiocactivity has been
generated in the fuel. Oxygen absorbers will be exposed to the atmosphere
within the cell and an oxygen monitor will be interlocked to open both the

_ fuel and the NaK drain valves if the oxygen concentration goes above 1%.

The energy produced from the various reactlons, including those reqnlr-‘

ing an oxygen atmosphere, have been calculated in Appendix B and are summar-
ized in Table 5.3. The most serious event would be that in which the shield
water would combine in stoichiometric proportions with all the sodium and
NeK in the system, and the resulting bydrogen would burn in the presence of
the available oxygen in an air atmosphere in the reactor cell. If no heat
were lost to the cell walls, the pressure in the cell would reach 181 psia..
0bv1ously, this is an overestimate because comsiderable heat would be re-
moved by the surrounding water durlng the course of the reactlon.

If all of the hydrogen were to mix with the oxygen without igniting,
detonation could take place and give a shock wave that would increase the

66 psia, arises from the hyﬂrogennoxygen reaction. If it is assumed thai
the pressure increase assoclated with datonatlon is twice the normal pres-
sure rise, or 132 psia, and that the pressure from all reactions prier to
the explosion is not relieved by heat removal by the walls of the cell,
then a peak pressure of o7 psia would result. This value is about double
that for the case in whlch a nltrogen atmosphere is malntained.withln the

‘ In all prdbabillty the hyﬂrogen Would‘barn as 1t was formed from the»»,,

NaKéwater reaction. The simultaneous occurrence of several unlikely events
would ‘be necessary for an explosion; namely, the oxygen absorbing and moni-
torlng system'would fail, an alr lesk inteo the cell would occur, a leak
between the sodium or NeK and the shielding water would occur, and the
hydrogen would not be ignibed as it was formed but would react only after
the major part of the NeK-water reaction had gone to completion. Even if
all of these things dld happen, it seems unlikely that the resulting shock
wave could rupture the tank wall, particularly in view of the inertia of
the steel wall and the water surrounding 1t.

charges set from within by sapoteurs would be feasible, as for any instal-
lation. However, the effectiveness of such action would depend primarily
on the proximity of the charge with respect to the most critical components,
i.e., the reactor pressure shell and the fuel drain system. Accessibility
to these components and therefore vulnerability will determine the effec-
tiveness of this type of sabotage. The double-walled reactor cell serves
as a barrier against entry and would be formidable as protectzon against
external explosions. However, the successful placement of an explosive
charge within the contalner durlng servicing operations could be effective.
In that event, the reactions of the reactor fluids, including the shield

One of the main reasons for surrounding ‘I:.he inner ta.n.k with a th:x.ck

L layer of water was to provide a simple, positive cooling system. The worst

. heat load 1ikely to be thrown on this cooling system would be that resulting
~ from discharge of Puel into the bottom of the tank after a long period at
‘high power. The lower portion of the tank will be designed so that the fuel

will be spread out in a layer 2 in. at the thickest point. For this thick-
ness of fuel and a 1/2-in.-thick steel plate tank bottom, 1t can be shown

Actually; any'acci&ent severe enough to dump all the fuel charge into
the bottom of the tank would prabably also rupture the shield so that the
shield water would float on the surface of the fluoride. It would boil vio-
lently, and water vapor would rise, condense on the tank walls, and draln
back to the bottom of the tank. :

The double-walled cell was devised primarily in an effort to give a
thoroughly reliable means for absorbing the heat evolved in any accident,
no matter how severe. No pumps or other motor-driven equipment would be
required and, even if the electrical power supply were to remain inoperable
for days after the accident, there would be enough heat capacity in the water
so that little, if any, of 1t would vaporize. The high surface heat transfer

coefficient associated w:th boiling of the water should ensure good eoellng

of the cell walls.
Comparison of Various Reactor Assembly'Containers

Because of the 1mportance of contalning the products of & remctor
accident, several different potentlal reactor containers were examined. A
comparison of key data for the most promising types of container is given in
Teble 5.4, and the worst set of conditions applicable to each case is pre-
gumed. As mey be seen, the reactor assembly cell propoged in this report
compares favorably with the hemispherical and ellipsoidal buildings. The
double-walled cell also appears superior in that it would be less subject
to sabotage. Even if both the inner and the outer tanks were ruptured by
sabotage and the reactor melted down, the residue would tend fo sink to the
bottom of the tank pit where it would be flooded by the water that had filled
the region at the top and between the tanks. This water would serve both to

| absorb the heat of any reaction and as & shield to reduce the radiation 1evel» 

at the top of the pit. After careful review of these and ‘a host of lesser
considerations, the 2h-ft-d1a double-walled cell was chosen as the most

oo . 6, DISPERSION OF ATRBORNE ACTIVITY

 Meteorological data have been used to calculate the possible radiation
hazards to the Laboratory and civilian population as a result of both nore
mal and accidental release of radicactive materials from the ART. The nor=-
mal method of discharging activity will consist of directing the off-gases
through a chercoelnfllled pipe which will remove most of the activity and
effect a more than two-day holdup before ejecting the residual gases up the
stack. The stack in carrying the large volumes of heatéd air produced by
the process systems will give very large plume rises in winds under 10 mph.
The resultant ground exposures will be always and everywhere substantially
below tolerance. In fact, even when there is no process air flow up the

stack, the resulbing exposures will be below tolerance.. The process alr'will;'

however, effect a reduction in the resulting ground concentration of around
10, which will be deszrable in some emergency 51tuatlons.

( L In the calculatlons for an dccidental release, a value of about 6 X 108
| | cal ves used. as the -minimum ameunt of heat which could cause all the fission
3 activity to be given off in a gaseous cloud. The total activity present was
i  then assumed to be that given by Millfs formula,2 even though ARE operation
: indicated that some of the act1v1ty'was continuously removed and therefore
not available 0 the disaster. This activity will be safely dispersed from
a hot daybtime cloud, but it will exceed tolerance at night by 2 meximum fac-
tor of 5 aor 17, depending upon which tolerance value is used. As would be
expected, the doses from the cold cloud or from rainout of either cloud

! would be well above tolerdnce.

It is worthy of note +that the assumptions made for the calculations
which follow, ‘both for the case of the discharge of activity up the stack
and for the. daspersmon of activity from a disaster, have been comservatively
A_ 'be.ken _atsevery step. The result:.ng safety factors combine to effect indi-

Holdup System. In the charcoal-filled pipe there will be over 100

times the minimmm amount of charcoal required to effect a two-day holdup

of krypton. In the calculatioms, no credit is taken for residence time
in ‘bhe reactor system or travel time in the off-ga.s system.

Meteorologlcal Parameters. A sta'bility :f:'a.ctor (m.gh‘btime) of 0.4 was

- used . in the disaster calculation rather than the more likely value of 0.35.
- The hot cloud and the stack plume rises were limited in some instances, '
- even though greater heights would have effected greater dispersioms. Although

the nighttime stable conditions will not last much longer than 16 hr, the

-unrealistic assumption of continuous nighttime conditions was not used for
continuous exposures or for disaster-cloud travel times of greater than

about 16 hr. ~ Low average wind velocity values were used for the hot cloud,

even thongh equally justifiable higher values would have effected grea.ter »
dispersions. Also, for each calculation that gives the maximum dose at any

location, it is assumed that the wind always blows in that direction with a

constant optimnm va.lue .

' FlSSlOB Products in Ho’c C'loud. fhe amount of heat in the hot clowd is

8 1ower limit for the amount of heat required to veporize all the fuel be-
-cause the heat of vapor:n.zatlon of the first component which comes off (as

the fuel is heated) is used for determining the heat reguired to vaporize
all the fuel. For determining the actin'by in the cloud, an upper limit

'is used, since all the fuel would mever be in the right place at the right

time to be vaporized. Also, operatlon of 'bhe ARE 1nd1cated that some
ac'blv:Lty may be removed continuously.

Radiation Tolera.nces |

The ma.ximwn total dose which the civilian populat:.on should be permit-
ted to receive in any accident is 25 rem. The maximmum permissible exposure
to contaminated a'bmosphere which will give a dose of 25 rem by inhaletion
is therefore of considerasble interest. A value for the maximum permissible
exposure of 10 curleasec/m has been given by Marley3 for total fission
products. However, Marley used a breathing rate of the order of 6 liters/min
that is considerebly lower than that for the average excited man, which is

 around 30 ll'bers/mln In applying Marley's tolerance to a given condition

the total radiation is assumed to decay accordn.ng to t"o'2 as the radio-
active cloud moves out from the source. | S

On the other hand, T. J. Burmett of the ORNL Health Physics Division
has calculated,™ on the basis of a selected group of 30 long-lived f'lssion
products, that the maximum permissible exposure to these isotopes is

1. hh curie- sec/m3 af'ter 39 d.ays5 of reactor operation. The 30 isotopes

1000 hr of eperatlon, these 30 1sotopes represent about 876 of the total
activity present at 1 sec, if £=0.2 i5 assumed for all the activity.
Since these are leng-lived isotopes, no decay correction is applied.

(It is further shown in Appendix G that this group of 30 isctopes may
be reduced to a group of six isotopes which combribute over 957( of the
dose to the bone.) . -

As was noted previously the off-gas system is designed to routinely
dischar Sge less than 0.001 curie/sec of Kr88 to the stack. The tolerance
-RbS8 has been calculated® to be 6.3 x 10-8 curies/m3 for contin-
uous exposure. This calculation permitted s dose rate of O 3 mrem/hr for
the 10“ hr of ccmtemplate& regctor opera‘blono

Discharge of,Ac-:t;ivi“ty up the Stack |

The ART stack is 78 ft high and 10 ft in diameter. Its dimensions
were largely defined by the air flow from the process systems since it was
desired to employ this air in order to effect greater dlspers:.on of the
off-ga.s.' The design capac.i'by of the air blowers is 3 % 102 cfm of air at

 ambient temperasture. This volume of air when heated in the hot-air radi-

ators to T50°F expands to 6.7 x 105 cfm, and ‘therefore, during power opera-
'bmn, thls 1atter qtrby of air is dlscharged up the stack.

The d.ispersa.on of ac.,t:.w.ty from the stack has been considered for
three conditions of air flow: (1) 6.7 x 107 cfm of T50°F air, (2) 3 x 107 cfm
of embient air, and (3) no air flow. With the two-day holdup provided in the
off-gas system before the off gases reach the stacks, the off gases may be
discharged without anywhere exceeding the k58 tolera:nce of 6 3 x 10~-8
cnrle/m for continuous exposure for the first two condrbmns. "For no’ st.ack
air flow, the Kr88 tolerance will be exceeded by a factor of k. Further-
more, if it becomes necessary following a ‘contained disaster to dispose of
large amounts of activity, as much as 8 curies/sec. could be discharged up

Figure 6.1 shows estimated plume rises versus wind speed for both -

6. T x 109 cfm alr_at 750°F and 3 X 105 cfm of air at amblent temperature.

The calculated plume rise values were used, together with ‘sppropriate )

" meteorological data Gerived from the dbservatlons reported by Myers and

Holland,9 to .compute the maximum ground concentrations and the distance
from the stack of the maximum ground concentration under a wide range of
wind speeds. The full plume rise was used in the unstable or daytime case,
but the plume rlse was limited to about 600 meters at night, which corre-

| ' sponds. to the upper limit of ‘observed rises from,the large TVA steam plant

stacks durlng ‘stable condltlons. The calculated rises below the 600-meter

‘level were used for the nighttime rise. This treatment of the stable case

minimizes the safety factor of the light-wind stable case which might be

the most doubtful. The important dispersion conditions which are considered
are those'whlch oceur with winds under 10 mps and are representative of 99. %
of the hours of'w1nd dbserved at the site. The parameters used for these
calculatlons are given in Teble 6.1.

  

decay’ correction given here is that determined by the decay rate for equi-

_ llbrlum reactor flSSlOD prodncts, £=0.

As prev1ously noted (sectlon on “Radlation Tolerances") the concentra-
tion of Kr®® for continuous exposure is 6.3 x 10~ curle/m « Furthermore,
for a reactor operating at 60 Mw the equilibrium dlscharge rate of Kr
after a two-day holdup in the off-gas system is 0.0009 curie/sec (section on
"Ooff-Gas System"). The maximum concentration (with no decay correction)
oceurs during the day at 0.37 mile from the source when the wind speed is

‘10 meters per second (1 mps = 2.24 miles per hour). This concentration

(6.08 x 10~9 curie/md per 0.00L curie/sec emitted) is a factor of 10 below
the toleranee for continuous exposure. Furthermore, it should be noted that
the w1nd.w1ll not blow in the same direction and with the same high (10 mps)
veloc1ty for 1000 continuous hours of daytlme conditions, and, in additionm, .

the actual off-gas holdup system will have over 100 times the amount of char-

coal required to effect the two-day holdup which was used in the above cal-
culations.

QgeratiOﬁﬁi%houﬁjﬁeetigg'Stack Air. Except when the reactor is oper- =

ating at full power the air flow up the stack will be less than 6.7 x 107 cfm
and the air temperature will be less than T50°F. For the limiting case with
no power bheing removed from the system, there will be 3 x 107 cfm of ambient
temperature air flow up the stack. A by-pass air duct will be provided
around the radiators so that the air may be sent up the stack without cool-
ing the reactor. The lower temperature and smaller air flow will produce
+the lower stack rises which are given by the lower curve in Fig. 6.1. These

EFFECTS OF A NUCLEAR ACCIDENT ON REACTOR STRUCTURE

The detailed design of the reactor and related equlpment has been
predicated upon the use of a stress level approximately one-fifth of
the stress for rupture in 1000 hr. Thus the system is one in which no
burst-type of rupture will be likely to occur. The type of failure to

- be expected would be the result of either a fatigue crack or a leak

caused by corrosion. In either case, the failure would develop slowly
s0 that there would be ample indication of the character of the trouble
before anything serious.developed. It should Dbe noted, however, that
while this philosophy has been applied to the types of accident and haz~
ards to be expected, no advantage of this design basis has been taken
‘in, consideration of extreme accidents. Such accidents could take place
only if a burst-type of rupture occurred, and such ruptures have been pre-
sumed, even though no reasonable mechanism for causing them has been en-

| v151oned.

In addltlon, twn major tenets of the design phllosophy have been that
the pressures throughout the systems should be kept low, particularly in
the hot zones, and that all structure should be cooled to a temperature
approximately equal to or below that of the secondary coolant leaving the

heat exchanger. Great care was exercised in establishing the proportions

of the designs presented in Tables F.l and F.2 to satisfy these conditions.
The stress values calculated for the various stations in a typical design
are indicated in Fig. 2.l. The stresses in the structural parts have been
kept to a minimum and the ability of the structure to withstand these
stresses has been made as great as practiceble. Thermal stresses are not
indicated since they will be indeterminate, and it is felt that they will,
to a large degree, anneal out at operaﬁlng temperatures.

of a nuclear acczdent, it is possible £0 envision fairly well the sequence
- of events tha$ would lead to a failure in the reactor structure.. The Pirst
3;1  cons1derat1on in any such analysis is the -strength of the material of the
_structure. Table F.3 presents strepngth data for Inconel, the structural
“'material presently being considered. Note that the yield point and ulti-
~ mate tensile strength are much higher than the lOOO-hr stress rupture Jimit.

Note also that the percent elongation. is substantlal and thus much plastic

Stress Calculations |
The principal element in +the reactor structure is the maln pressure

shell. It is a spherical vessel 1 in. thick with an internal diameter of
52.5 in. During normal operating conditions the temperature of the pres-
sure shell will be 1200°F. The stress in this shell for an internal pres-
sure P is given by - ' R o o o

 

s =L ELELEﬁiﬁL = 12. 9 p .
| . 2t .2 ,
The stress, S, and pres sure, P, are in p51 and the radzus, r, and the shell
~ thickness, %, are in inches., In re-examining the stress expression and
‘Table F.3 it is evident that the main pressure shell would begin te yield
at a pressure of about 1000 psi at sitress concentrations such as those
which will be present in the ligament between the heat exchanger inlet and
outlet header pipes. It would be expected that progressive local ylelding .
'would contlnue to take place in these regions until failure occurredj some
increase in pressure would occur in the process. Another major weak area
would be the flat structural region at the top of the shell where the pumps
and expansion tanks are 40 be located. While final detalled designs are
- not yet avallable, it does seem certain that local yielding would begin in
o this region at a pressure “of the order of 1000 psi. It also seems likely

 

'>: f;!that one result of this yielding would be that the pump casings would dis-
'*.Atort'and cause_the 1mpellers to seize in the casings and the pumps to stop.

This would glve a ten31le strength of 1k, 100 psi, which represents an \
average stress in the ligaments. The peak value around the edge of the
holes would be spproximately twice as great so that yielding would begln

 there. The stress would then distribute itself uniformly across the liga-

ment, and further plastic deformation would follow until a tear would‘begln
and rupture would finally take placea

The stresses in the outer core shell are of partlcular 1nterest be-
cause expansion of that core shell.would increase the fuel volume in the
reactor and as a consequence give an increase in reactivity, If the core
shell were not supported by the moderator, the stress in the shell would

Note that a factor of 1.6 1nstead of 2 was used in the denomlnator because‘

the’ radius of curvature of the core shell at the equator in the vertical
Plane is greater than it is in the horizontal plane. This core shell is.
actually supported by flattened Inconel wires inserted betlween the core
shell and the beryllium reflector and spaced in rows on l~in. centers.
These strips are used primarily to maintain the spacing between the reflec-
tor and the shell and hence to ensure the proper coolant flow passage open-
ing. It is interesting to determine the radius of curvature of the shell

when deflected between the supports by a pressure that would give the same

stress in the core shell as would prevail in the main pressure shell. If

| a simplified cylindrical geometry is assumed, the relation for that case

is
| g _Bx 25.7  Pr

o T 2x 1. 7 0.d25 7 | | | 7 | |
from which a radius of 1.6 in. is obtained. Thus the core shell would
deflect to the point where it would have a radius of curvature of 1.6 in.

between supports° The effect on the core volume of this distortion coupled"
with that of the immer core shell would be relatively small, and would give
-1 volume 1ncrease of about 1% for a lOOO-ps1 pressure. The stresses in the

1nner core shell would be similar to, but lower than, those in the outer

“core shell because its dlameter would be roughly onewhalf that of the outer'

core shell.

The force reqnlred to blow the pump body out of the pump casing is |
of interest. TP it is assumed that the main pressure shell would begin to
yield locally ‘under & pressuré “of 1000 psiy the force actlng on the pump

- body may-be calculated in the follow;ng way

   
    

 

‘_Pump body blow-oub _fo Shaan 1000 x o 786 x 5.75 = 26,000 lb.

   

The cross—sectional area of“the pump body attachlng screws is over 2 1n.2,

and since "this is the vweakest point in the system restraining the pump
‘body from blow-out and since it is in a cold region where the tensile

strength of the material is of the order of 90,000 psi, it is clear that
this does not represent a weak point in the system. While the thrust bear-
ing at the top of the pump impeller shaft might fail and allow the impeller
shaft assembly to move upward several inches, the pump impeller itself

"would.keep the shaft from moving on out through the pump body. If this
failure took place there would be free communication from the reactor core

through the pump 1mpeller bore 1nto the fuel expansxon tank.

The volumetrlc stlffness of the main pressure shell is of interest
from the standpoint of determining the pressure at various stages during a
nuclear accident. The change in volume, AV, in cubic feet, is glven as

where Ar is in inches and represents - er of the 1ns de

:ngpof the pressure shell, Note that a modulus of elastlclty, E, of 21 x 10
'f'was‘“Séd’s1nceAthe pressure shell temperature should be a little below
- 1200°F. From this it follows that “the increase in volume inside the pres-

sure shell for a J00O-psi pressure surge would be 0.076 1. It should be
noted that the pressure shell in some respects would be stiffer than it is
‘assumed to be here because of the presence of the liner in the heat ex-

changer region and at the south end. On the other hand, the system would

fAbe less stiff because of the presence of flat regions in the pump and
'Vexpan31on Tank region. It seems likely that a rough approx;matlon to
the stiffness of the system has been given.

Destructlveness of Pressure Shell Fragments
- The velocity of the fluld escaping through & crack if rupture should
occur at lOOO psi is of interest. Th1s can be cemputed as follows.

‘ ‘wﬁeie H 1s the pressure (1n lb/fta) d1v1ded'by the densmty of the fluld

(in Ib/ft ). This velocity of 215 fps is certainly a reasonable one and
should not give any particular trouble. It is also important because it

represents the maximum possible veloczty of a fragment that might be broken
- out of the pressure shell in the event of a hydrostatic rupture. It is

interesting to estimate the maximum kinetic energy that could exist in an
escaping fragment for this case. The work or energy put into the fragment

~in the rupture process should equal double the area under the PV diagram
for the pressure at rupture and the volumetric increase inside the pressure

shell up to the rupture pressure. This triangular PV diagram area should .

be multiplied by a factor of two to allow for the elastic overshoot or re-'

bound of the shell accompanylng the pressure rellef- o

It is also of 1nterest to calculate the wezght W, of the mlnlmnm _ragment

K. E. = 10,900 = 32 5 §215)

W 15 1b.

Thus it appears that the most destructive fragment from a pressure shell
fallure at 1000-psi pressure would be a 35-1b fragment that would leave the
reactor at a veloeity of 215 fps with a kinetic energy of about 11,000 ft-lb.
If this fragment were of l-in.-thick Inconel, its area would be 260 in.2,

If it were to strike the lead shield and all of its momentum were imparted
to a lead fragment of the same area having a thickness of 7 in., the result-
ing velocity of the lead fragment could not exceed 20 fps if no allowance
were made for the energy absorbed in rupturing the lead. ’

In re-examining the above analysis it appears that a number of modes
of failure might be encountered. If no special provision were made to re-

lieve the pressure it seems likely that the north head would deflect plas-

tically to the point where the pump impellers would seize in their casings.
Thus whether the increase in volume associated with this deflection would
be sufficient to relieve the pressure associated with the nu¢lear reaction
would depend upon the particuler accident. Certainly, if carried far
enough, rupture would occur. If rupture did occur it seems unlikely that

a large fragment or, for that matter a small fragment, would be blown out
of the wall of the main pressure shell, Rather it  seems likely that the
well would split and open up to relieve the excessive Pressure. It seems
most likely that this splitting would occur in the ligaments between the
heat exchanger outlet tubes at the south end of the reactor. In that event
about a 5/&-1n. stretch in theee llgaments would prebebly'occur prior to
failure. , ,

Pressure Relief Hecha.nisms ' '

Provision can be made in ‘the design to relieve a v1olent pressure
surge from a nuclear accident in & number of ways. It would be possible,
for example, to put a poppet valve in the fuel region just ashead of the
fuel pump inlet so that it would open and vent to the expansion tank. The

utility of such a move is doubtful because the volume available in the ex-

pansion tank is probably not quite adequate to take care of an extreme nu-
clear accident. While an overflow will be connected from the top of the
expansion tank to the emergency fuel dump tank, and thls "line will be kept
heated at all times, its diameter would have to be at least 4 in, if it
were to be effective in relieving a pressure surge in a nuclear accldent.
A second provision for pressure relief could take the form of a frangible
diaphragm. If this frangible diaphragm were placed at the bottom of the
reactor it would be in a high-pressure region and would be subjected to a

- pressure of approximately TO psi under normel operating conditions. Thus ...

it would have to be designed to rupture at a pressure of at least 400 psi

 because the ratio of the ultimate tensile strength to the 1000-hr rupture

strength is apprOX1mately 4 at 1200°F. Thus, if a factor of safety of k
were used in the design of the disk, under normal operatlng conditions the
pressure at that point would have to be roughly 16 times as great to produce
failure, or about 1000 psi. If, on the other hand, the diaphragm were placed
at, or close to, the fuel pump inlet where the pressure would normelly be,

perhaps 5 psi, it could be designed to rupture at a pressure of 60 psi and

still have a factor of safety of 12, stress-wise, for normal operating con-
ditions. Yet another device that might be used would be to employ a weak
seam in the attachment of the whole north head or some part thereof. This

.;‘,@ﬁagaln would have the dlsadvantage that it would operate under high stress
- for normal”operatlng condltlone if 1t were designed for rupture at a pres-

shearing the lead. Note that the velocity of the Inconel and lead frag-
ments at the end of the expension is only about 40 fps. While the failure
might start first on one side so that the disk might tilt during the process
of failure, this would.prdbably result in opening a flap in the pressure
shell without tearing the flap loose from the shell and ejecting it as a
progectlle. The worst case would occur if the flap were ejected and tilted
in flight so that it would strike the tamk bottom edgewise. The velocity
required for such a projectile to pierce the tank wall can be estimated

from the relation for the energy required to punch holes in plate, i.e.,

that the worst casé in Fig. E.2 that appea¥s, on this basis, to leave the

EXPOSURE HAZARD CALCULATTOfis'

-~ Criteria

- The caleulations of the exposure hazard were based on a total internal
exposure of not more than 25 rem to any internal organs (pone, thyroid,
lungs, G. I. tract, kidneys) over the lifetime of the people exposed. Since
the general population is being considered, the lifetime 1s taken to be

. 70 years. The group of people to be protected includes children, the preg-
nant, those especially radiosensitive, those with large previous exposure
Tecords, and those occupationally exposed. If D is the exposure rate to the

organ, then

where time, %, begins with the intake of the isotope mixture. The intake
may be either by inhalation or by ingestion. \

fraction of the inhaled isotope i that is retained in the critical organ.
The critical organ is that organ of the body which receives the isotope

'_lthat results in the greatest to the body. In most cases it is that organ
which receives the greatest damage. However, some organs are less essen-

tial to the well-being of the entire body. Ususlly the critical organ is

. that which receives the greatest concentration, but there is considerable

varlatlon in semsitivity. The critical organ depends also on the mode of

_intake and.may change W1th tlme after 1ntake.

' Calculational Procednre |

The com@onents of a given mlxture of mixed fi351on products are

~ ‘grouped by the body organs.affected. A tabulation of %, Taqs and
::Z: E(BBE)N values is then made and the corresponding values of D are cale
jculated.by using the m of the organ. These can be summed to glve the ini-

tial. dose rates to the organ.

- The values of D; are then tabulated, together with those for T;. By
combining these with values of (l-e }&t) for various times, t, follow1ng
intake, the total doses Dt aré found. The values of Dt are then summed,
and the totals are used to calculate MP125/70 : ‘

Values of % will vary'W1th the mixture of 1sotopes consldered, Whlch

in turn depends on the time of reactor operation. This is also sensitive

to the eholce of isotopes for the mixture to be considered.

" The components of the selected mixture were chosen because-af their

jknown hazard and for half lives generally in the range of 20 hr to 20 years.
Shorter~lived isotopes would have Df values small enough to ignore, and

longer~-lived. isotopes would have small % values for the operational times

of interest with high-power-density reactors where the reactor is operated with
8 maxX. '1rredlat10n time of the order of 1000 hr.. Buildup of longer

lived materials is small for ‘these times. Parent-daughter relations also
influenced the choice of some isotopes and their inclusion. Sinee the

- composition of the mixture chosen will vary with time following a reactor
incident because of the differing decay rates of its components, there would

, be correspondlng different MP125/70 values at different points sufflclently

far downW1nd for the airborne tran51t time to 1ntroduce these decay dlffer-
ences. As a first spproximation the decay differences can be ignored, since
the mixture chosen undergoes small decay for the relatively short times of

e '1nterest for most reactor accldents for which the radius of hazard is small. '

For this fzrst approximamion, the MPIEB/TO based on initial concentrataon

can be used. It is prcbable that the effect of decay may be compensated
by increases of the relative %y values and, since the longer lyved mater~
ials are more hazardous, the net effect could be smaller MPI25 values

at more distant p01nts where dec&y'would be 51gniflcant.
The E: E(RBE)H values used are-either those given by the Internatzonal

The value 3.36. x 10 dls/sec/Mw was obtained by using 186 MEV/fiSSlOH

as given by Wigner in ORNL-1638, Project Hope (p. 16). The value given by

Wigner is in agreement with the Bulk Shleldlng Facility value of 190 +
