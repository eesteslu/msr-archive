ABSTRACT

Three types of frozen-seal "valves" were tested for possible use in
the MSRE, The seal was melted by direct resistance heat, by induction
heat, and by clamp-on Calrod heat. The frozen seal was made in a pre-
formed restriction section of a standard piece of pipe by a cooling-gas

Jjet stream directed at the restriction. All three valves performed satis-

-factorily through 100 test cycles. The Calrod-heated valve was selected

for MSRE use on ﬁhe basis of simplicity of design and of operation. Two
of the valves are successfully undergoing further tests on the MSRE
Engineering Test Loop.

INTRODUCTION

At the beginning of the Molten Salt Reactor Program a proven, reliable,
mechanical valve was not available; moreover, it was decided that a develop-
ment program for such a valve would not be undertaken at that time. Past

''and a

experience indicated some success with a freeze-plug type "valve,'’
short evaluation program was initiated. Three types were tested in valve
test stands by using reactor-quality salt at 1100 to lZOOoF, and all three
types proved satisfactory for holding pressures up to 60 psig. Each valve
was frozen and melted 100 times. There were no'electrical or mechanical
failures. Additional experience was gained through operation of the valves

incorporated in the Engineering Test Loop in Building 9201-3.
TEST EQUIPMENT

Two test stands were built which were identical except for the valve
bodies and auxiliary heating equipment for each valve. A description of
one test system will apply to both.

Figure 1 shows that the system (including the valve) was vertically
mounted. The total volume of the system was 5.6 gal. The sump tank was
made of 6-in. sched-40 Inconel pipe and had a volume of 2.2 gal. A 3/8-in.
sched-40 Inconel pipe connected the sump tank to the'l-l/z-in. INOR-8 valve
body by means of a 3/8- to 1-1/2-in. INOR-8 bell reducer. The connection
from the valve body to the head tank was by similar means. The head tank
was made of 6-in. schethO,INOR-B;-the-volume'of this tank vas also
2.2 gal. e
Salt-level indicatbfs:wéfé bf_the contact probe type and signaled by

The molten salt was moved from the lower to the upper tank by means

 of gas pressure. Héliﬁm'ﬁas ﬁsedif6r'this,pﬁr@ose and to provide an inert-
- atmosphere blanket for,the_Salt;ﬂ_Afsuitable'gas regulating and venting

station was provided for this purpose. The system was vented to the atmos-

phere through a CWS filter.,

Variac-controlled heat was applied to the tanks and piping by means
of Calrod and clamshéll heaters. Average power required to maintain 1100
to 1200°F in the system was 4.5 kw.

Coolant used for the freeze cycle was plant air or fan-forced room
air blown across the area of the valve to be frozen. The freezing tem-
perature of the salt was 800 to 850°F as measured by externally attached
thermocouples located l-l/z-in. above and l-l/z-in. below the center of
the valve.

TEST CYCLE

The procedure used for valve tests ﬁas as follows:

1. Maintain the average loop temperature above the melting
point of the salt, with salt in the sump tank.

2. Close the equalizing valve at the gas regulating station
and apply approx 8 psig of helium to the sump tank.
Vent the head tank and allow salt to rise to the lower
indicating probe in the head tank (approx 600 ce of
salt). o

3. With zero salt flow, turn on 50 to 60 cfm of air
(approx 6 1b/min) to the freeze-plug area. Maintain
this air flow forrlO to 15 min to freeze.

L. Reduce air flow to 7 to 10 cfm to maintain plug.

5. Apply 60 psig of gas to the head tank and maintain
this pressure until system temperatures reaéh-equilib- |
rium. " S o

6. Vent the ovérpféSéﬁré;_eqnalize head and sump-tank

7. Apply.pOWer td the freeze-plug ares and melt the salt.
Melt-out is indicated by the head~tank probe light.

 
 

 

 

8. Turn off heat to the plug area; allow salt to run by

gravity to the sump.

9. Repeat cycle.

The size of the frozen area of salt was established by controlling
the flow of coolant and by adjusting the heat applied to the valve body on
each side of the plug. A positive seal appeared to be & plug approx
3 in. long including the transitioh zone. |

The freeze-plug zone was cold formed to meke a flat, 2 in. long with
a 20° angle of approach and discharge. The flats were formed on opposite
sides of the pipe to make a —__>={_ _ shaped flow restrictor. Inside
dimensions were 1/2 in. x 2-1/# in. x 2 in. long. The induction coil was
formed to permit preferential heating toward the outer edges of the freeze

plug and to fit over the 2~in. pipe flat. No part of the heating coil was -

attached to or touching the pipe. The coil occupied 6 in. of pipe length
and was attached to the generator by standard brass tubing fittings and
1/k-in. copper tube. Water cooling of the generator and heating coil was
required when the generator was in operation.

The freeze plug was formed by directing controlled air flow in a l-in.
pipe between the heating coils to each of the flats. The air nozzles were
spaced 6 in. from the valve. Two methods of supplying cooling air were
employed: low-pressure air from a centrifugal blower piped to each valve
flat with a Z-in. hose and high—préssure building air piped through a
regulator and rotameter to each of the valve flats with a l-in. pipe.

Calrod-Heated Valve

- The Calrod-heated valve was made up at the completion of the induction-
heated valve test. The same flattened pipe section (2-in. flats) was used
by simply removing the induction coll and clamping & 1000-w lSOOOF Calrod
to each flat. The 24-in. Calrods were bent into 6-in. long W-shaped units-
and clamped onto the pipe. The final forming was done by heating the
Calrod and tamping it into place to make a close fit to the pipe. FPower
was controlled by a panel-mounted Variac. Cooling was accamplished by-

blowing air across the flats in the seme manner as was used for the induc-
tion valve.

t

Figure 4 shows the valve. Thermocouples for the test were externally
welded to the valve. One thermocouple was centered on the broad face of

the 2-in., flat, one was spaced 1-1/2 in. above, and one vas spaced. l-l/z‘in.
below the center.

RESULTS OF TEST-~VALVE QOPERATION
Resistance-Heated Valve

The valve was cycled 100 times without incident. A curve of melt
.time vs power input is shown on Fig. 5a. Figure 5b shows heat removal vs
volume rate of cooling air across the freeze-plug area. A flow of approx
8 scfm was required to maintain the plug. ' |

After testing, thé valve was removed from the loop for examination.
The general appearance of the valve was normal.

Induction-Heated Valve

The valve was cycled 100 times without difficulty and with no |
apparent damage to the pipe. The average melt time was 35 sec at 12 kw.
Freeze time was 10 to 15 min with 50 to 60 efm of air. A flow of approx
8 scfm was required to maintain the plug. |

Calrod-Heated Valve

The Calrod-heated valve was cycled 100 times with no difficulty.
Figure 5a shows the melt time vs power input. The average melt time was
3 min with 1.6 kw input. Again, an air flow of approx 8 scfm was required
to maintain the plug. The maximum Calrod sheath temperature attained in
3-1/2 min was l300°F. No severe oxidation was apparent on the heating ele-

ment.
DISCUSSION OF TEST-VALVE INSTALLATION AND OPERATION

A1l the valves tested performed satisfactorily, with adequate freeze
and thaw times. However, the expense and complexity of the associated
equipment and the operating procedures differed widely with the various
types of valves.

The problems associated with using a high-current - low-voltage source
of power would make the direct-resistance valve cumbersome for use in a
reactor system. To obtain reasonable operating voltage, & long piece of
pipe was required between the electrical connections. This added length
required auxiliary heat during the freeze cycle to prevent formation of an
excessively large plug. It was necessary to turn off these heaters
(two 1000-w Calrods) during the melt cycle to prevent burnout when the
direct-resistance heat was applied.

The induction-heated valve, although much faster than the others,
required an expensive highAfreqaeaey generator (455 ke).

The valve heated with clamped-on Calrod heaters appeared to be the
best of the three types of'valvesrtested. It has the advantage of struc-
tural and electrical simpllcity with adequate freezing and melting times.

The two thermocouples 1ocated away from the center of the valve in

: the Calrod-heated valve were useful in determining the frozen-plug size.
~ Since the thermocouples were located directly in or close to the cooling
air stream, they gave a relative temperature reading only; however, once

~ the plug size and freeze point had been establlshed the thermocouple

-l/2 in. above the valve center was used as the frozen-condition indicator.

 
 

 

 

14

The use of a low-pressure centrifugal blower to supply cooling air
was sbandoned due to the control difficulties. The low available pressure
dfop prohibited restriction of the flow without a damper cocntrol mechanism
and required large air leads to the valve. DProper sizing of a blower with
a variable-speed motor control and an air-volume meter would have permitted
satisfactory operation. However, in the absence of this control the frozen
plug was too large to permit reasonable melt times. |

The use of high-pressure building air through standard controls per-
mitted very close control of the valve operation as well as the use of
much smaller air tubes to the valve flats. One~inch pipe was used for the
air tube during the test. However, the use of smaller (approx 1/2-in.)
tubing was indicated. An air supply which permits the use of small air
ducts has the advantages of simplifying the control problem to a great
extent-and reducing the over-all size of the valve assembly.

DESCRIPTION OF VALVE INSTALTATION IN ENGINEERING TEST LOOP

The Calrod-heated valve was selected for use in the MSRE on.the basis
of the previously described work and was incorpofated into the hot-salt
MSRE Engineering Test Loop located in building 9201-3. The valves were
mounted horizontally and oriented as shown on Fig. 6.

The two valves were identical and were formed from 1-1/2-in. sched-40
pipe by using the same jig (2-in. flats) as was used to form the induction-
heated development valve. The valves were heated by two 1000-w Calrod
circular-wound heaters as shown on Fig. 7, which also shows the location
of the coolant-air nozzles. These nozzles were l/Z-in. copper tubing
terminating 1 in. from the valve flats. Coolant air was supplied to the
valves from the building instrument air system and was controlled-by reg-
ulators and rotameters. The reference temperature thermocouple was located
1.5 in. from the center of the valve flat (shown in Fig. 6).

The purpose of the valve arrangement shown in Fig. 6 was twofold:

(1) To provide & common line from the operating system to

the flush drain tank or fuel drain tank such that the
salt flow could be directed to or from either one tenk

or the other. One valve or the other will be frozen
at all times depending upon the operation.

(2) To ensure ﬁﬁaﬁ sufficient salt would remain in the

valve to make & positive frozen seal under all con-
ditidns.

The volume of the operating system is such that, when salt is moved
from either of the drain tanks to the operating system, there will always
be salt in the valves to make a seal.- The surge pots shown in Fig. Sa
between the valves and the drain tanks make it impossible to completely
empty the valves when draining the ecirculating system into the tanks. The
surge-pot volumes are such that there is sufficient residual salt in the
valve body to form a seal. The valve bodies would drain completely were
it not for these pots.

FREEZE-VALVE OPERATION AND RESULTS IN THE ENGINEERING TEST LOOP

The valve to the flush tank in the Engineering Test Loop was operated
with coolant salt (LiF-BeF,, 66-34 mole %) through 40 cycles without diffi-
culty. After approx 1300 hr of operation the initial melt appeared to
fail to open the line, but indications are that the difficulty was a plug
in the line upstream from the valve. Once the drain line was clear the
adjacent valve, vhich had seen the same operation conditions, operated
normally. -

The average freeze time was 7.5 min and required 6 to 7 scfm (approx
0.5 lb/min) air flow. Air flow required to maintain the plug was approx
3.5 scfm (approx 0.3 1b/min). The freeze cycle was accomplished with zero

. salt flow in the pipe in all cases. The frozen-plug length at TOOOF

reference temperature was @pprbx 3 in.

The melting- time vs power input curves for-this valve are shown on

Fig. 8. The difference-ihﬁmelt times between the 500 and TOOOF steady-
state reference temperatures shows clearly the effect of the frozen-plug

size. - o .
Anfoperational test was performed on the Engineering Test Loop to check

the operation of the valves under a forced-drain condition. The valve to

the fuel drain tank remained frozen while the flush-drain tank valve was
melted. Five psig of helium was impressed on the circulating system to
force the salt into the flush-drain tank through the valve. Gas flow was
permitted to continue through the valve at the completion of the draining
operation at a ratevof 2.2 scfm helium. The gas flow was then shut off,
the gas pressures were equalized between the drain tank and the pump, the
valve was frozen, and x-ray photographs were taken of the valve assembly.
The photographs indicated that sufficient salt remained in the wvalves to
form a seal (Fig. 6). The valve proved to be leak-tight when gas pressure

was reapplied.
DISCUSSION OF VALVE OPERATION IN THE ENGINEERING TEST LOOP

Operation of the valves has been satisfactory, with the exception of
the one blockage that is believed to have been due to & plug in the upstream
line and not due to the wvalve design or operation.

The lower cooling-air requirement for these valves compared with the
earlier valves is attributed to the air nozzle being only 1 in. away from
the valve flat and to the better'a1r flow to the flat that is permitted by
the open-center winding of the Calrods. The surge pots appear to be ade-
quate to prevent the,vélverfrcm’being blown empty during a forced dump.
The equalization of gas pressures during freezing is an important opera-
tional procedure for two reasons: the valve is difficult to freeze with
any movement of salt due tbmdifferences4in gas pressure, and reverse gas

flow just before freezing_cbuld possibly ieave a gas pocket in the valve

~ with salt on each side.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS :

The Calrodéhéated‘valvé'iS-fécommended'because of its structural sim-

plicity and the'51mplici£y;oflthexassociated power and control equipment.

‘The Calrod unit should be rolled in & tight coil as shown in Fig. 7 rather

than the WFshaped_units_aEVWEre used for the development valve. This 1s
to avoid short-radius bends and to provide better air flow. A single unit
 

 

20

"horseshoed" around the flat in & manner similar to the induction coil

shown on Fig. 3 would be desirable. This would reduce the nunmber of power

leads and make an easily removable unit.

Cooling air requirements will depend‘on cell temperature and cooling

air temperature. Two volume rates are required: a high rate to make the

initial freeze and a low rate to hold the freeze.

The holding flow rate controls the plug size and must be selected and

kept steady to prevent a meltout from heat leakage due to insufficient

cooling. Too much cooling will result in a 1arge plug and consequent ex-

cessive meltout time. The holding flow rate should preferably be determined

in the field since it is dependent on cell and cooling air temperatures.

Surge pots having a ratio of vertical leg volume to the volume of the

horizontal valve and pipe section of 2, as shown in Fig. 5a, should be in-

stalled to prevent the valves from being blown empty. For a given system,

operating procedures must be analyzed to determine the location of these

pots.

The use of high-pressure compreésed air, rather ‘than low-pressure

blower-supplied air, for cooling is recommended because of easier control,

smaller ducts, and smaller over-all size of the valve assembly.

Recommended freeze-valve controls are:

1.

2.

Manual control of power to Calrods and manual air-flow
control.

Interlock to prevent heat and cooling air from being
applied at the same time.

Once the freeze temperature has been established, the
center thermocouple should be interlocked to switch
automatically from high- to low-volume air flow.

A high-temperature (1500°F) cutout or alarm located

on the Calrod sheath.

An interlock between a liquid-level probe and the

- valve pover imput to prevent prolonged heating of

the Calrod. Once the melt is accomplished and the
salt is flowing, further heat is not needed.
