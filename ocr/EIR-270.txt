sSummary

 

The possibilities for the transmutation of caesium-137
and strontium~90 in high-flux fast reactor with molten
plutonium chlorides and with thermal column 1s discussed.
The effecitve half life of Cs-137 could be decreased ifrom

30 years to 4-5 years, and for Sr-90 to 2-3 years.
Introduction

The problem of management of highly radioactive fission product

waste has been intensely and extensively discussed in the recent

paper WASH - 1297 and especially in BNWL 1900 (Fig. 1).

Here only tne transmutation of Fission Products (F.P.) without the

recycling of the actinides 1s discussed, making use of neutron

irradiation by means of a fission reactor (Fig. 2).

Why, contrary toc many assertions, i1s neutron transmutation in

a fusion reactor not feasible.

Why recent discussicns concerning transmutation in fission

reactors are rather pessimistic.

Could the transmutation in & fission reactor be possible

taking into account the neutron balance in a breeding system?

Which are the F.P. candlidates for irradiation in a fission

reactor?

Is the rate of transmutation sufficiently high in a fission

reactor?

In what type of fission reactor is the transmutation physically

possible?

What are the limiting parameters for transmutation in a solid

fuelled fission reactor?

Is a very high flux fission reactor possible if the fuel is

in the liquid state instead of the solid state?

How could such a high flux fast reactor with circulating liquid
fuel and a thermal column operate as a 'burner' for some F.P.

(Cs=-137 Sr-90 etec) transmutation.

1. Why the transmutation of F.P. is not feasible in a controlled

thermonuclear reactor (CTR):

 

The recent studles of the use of a C.T.R. as a transmutation
machine for at least the conversilion of Cs-137 have been to some
extent optimistic. Table 1 gives a summary of fhe most important

data and resulte from BNWL 1900.

and are clearly too small for Jjustifying such a complicated
technology as transmutation in a CTR. In spite of this Wolken-
hauer writes: "the flux level is somewhat higher than that
usually associliated with CTR power plants. This value was selec-
ted based upon the hope that by the time transmutation 1s applied
in a CTR that technology will have advanced far enough to allow
for the implied vacuum wall locading. If this high a value proves
to be unrealistic longer irradiation times will be required"
"attractive transmutation rates have not been demon-

strated up to this point",.

Also all these calculations were done on the basis of isotopically
pure Cs-137 and Sr-90. Later Wolkenhauer writes, "any practical
scheme would probably involve elemental rather than isotopic

loadings".

Comment 2

In BNWL-1900 it was noted that the calculation (in a moderating

blanket of the CTR) represents a more realistic blanket configu-

ration with a neutron wall loading of 10 MW/mg. (This is still

 

a very optimistic value. M.T.)

In this case the following date have been obtained for a therma-

lised neutron flux from a CTR with a 10 MW/m2 wall loading.

The conclusions of this study are that useful quantities of
Cs=137 could be transmuted under the projected CTR blanket
loading conditions. The reduction in Cs-137 "toxicity" is still
expected to be at most a factor 3 down. In addition a study

of the bulld-up of fission product nuclei in order to establish
the requirements of periodic chemical processing and associated

costs has not been carried out.

Comment 3

H.W. Lefevre (appendix to BNWL-1900) makes an interesting comment
on the study of the transmutation of Cs-137 and Sr-90 in CTR:

'"Everyone knows that a CTR will be "clean". Don't spoil that
illusion. I think that I would worry some about a CTR loaded
with 50 kg of Cs-137"'.
2. Why recent remarks about transmutations in a fission reactor

 

are rather pessimistic

 

A recent and most intensive study of the use of a fission reactor
for the transmutation of fission products has been published by
Clalborne (1972). He writes:

"The problem fission products cannot be eliminated by any system
of fission power reactors operating in either a stagnant or
expanding nuclear power economy since the production rate exceeds
the elimination rate by burnout and decay. Only a equilibrium
willl the production and removal rates be equal, a condition

that is never attained in power reactors. Equilibrium can be
obtained, however, for a system that includes the stockpile of
fission products as part of the system inventory since the stock-
plle will grow until its decay rate equals the net production rate
of the system. For the projected nuclear power economy, however,
this will require a very large stockpile with its associated
potential for release of large quantitites of hazardous radio-
isotopes to the environment. It is this stockpile that must

be greatly reduced or eliminated from the blosphere. A method
suggested by Steinberg et al. i1s transmutation in "burner reactors",
which are designed to maximize neutron absorption in separated
fission products chargzed to a reactor. If sufficlent numbers of
these burners are used, the fission products inventory of a
nuclear power system can then reach eguilibrium and be maintained
at an irreducible minimum, which i1s the quantity contained in the
reactors, the chemical processing plants, the transportation

system, and in some industrilal plants.

If the assumption 1s made that burner reactors are a desirable
adjunct to a nuclear economy, what are the design requirements
and limitations: It i1s obvious that they must maximize (with

due regard to economics) the ratio of burnout of a particular
fission product to its production rate in fission reactors, and
the neutron flux must be high enocugh to cause a significant
decrease in its effective half-life. Of the fission types, the
breeder reactor has the most efficient neutron economy and in
principle would make the most efficient burner if all or

part of the fertile material can be replaced by a Sr-Cs mixture
without'causing chemical processing problems or too large a
perturbation in the flux spectrum because of the different
characteristics of these fission products. The cost accounting
in such a system would set the value of neutrons absorbed in
the fission product feed at an accounting cost equal to the value

of the fuel bred from those neutrons.

The maximum possible burnout of fission products would occur when
the excess neutrons per fission that would be absorbed in a
fertile material are absorbed instead in the fission product feed,
The largest possible burnout ratio would then be the breeding
ratic (or conversion ratio for non-breeders) divided by the
fisslon product yield. The estimated breeding ratio for the
Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR), a thermal breeder, is 1.05

and for the Liguid Metal Fuelled Fast Breeder Reactor (LMFBR),
1.38. The yield of 13705 + 9OSr is 0.12 atom/fission, but a number
of other isotopes of these elements are produced which would also
absorb neutrons. However, 1f the fission product waste is aged

two years before separation of the cesium and strontium, the
13705 + QOSP

Cs (which will capture neutrons to form 136Cs that

mixture will essentially be composed of about 80%
and 20% 135
decays with a 13=-day half-1ife (M.T. see Comment 4): consequently
13703 90

the maximum burnout ratio for + Sr will be decreased by
20%. This leads to a maximum possible burnout ratio of about 7

for the MSBR and about 9 for the LMFBR. Unfortunately, however,
the neutron fluxes 1in these designs are well below 1016n cm_gs_l.
Any modifications of these designs to create high neutron fluxes
wlll increase the neutron leakage and decrease the burnout ratios

significantly." (Claiborne 1972)
10

Comment 4

It is not clear why Claiborne claimed that after 2 years ageing
and separation of strontium and caesium the isotope composition

will be

Cs=1357

807 Sr=-90

20% Cs-13%5
From Crouch (1973%) the fission products of U-235 have the following

composition (2 years ageing) (in at % per fissioned nucleous)

(see Table 3).

 

Sr-88 (stable) 3,63
Sr-90 (28 years) b .39
Cs-1%3% (stable) 6.57
Cs-134 (2 years) 3.5 (7.09-0.5 from independent yield)
Cs-13%5 6.26
Cs-1357 5.99
Subtotal 30. 34

"he realistic data are unfortunately more than twice those cited

by Claiborne.

The same negative opinions concerning the use of Fission Reactors

for F.P.-transmutation are given by the following authors:

- A.S. Kubo (BNWL - 1900):
"Fission products are not conductive to nuclear transformation
as a general solution to long term waste management".

- BNWL - 1900, itself:

"In summary 1t is improbable that transmutation of fission
products in fission reactors could meet any of the technical
feasibility requirements for the production of stable daughters'.

- Claiborne (1972):

"Developing special burner reactors with the required neutron
flux of the order of 1017n cm s~ 1 is beyond the limits of
current technology'.
5.

11

Is the transmutation in a fission reactor possible taking into

 

account the neutron balance in a breeding system?

 

In spite of all these pessimiétic opinions on the transmutation of

F.P. (especilally Cs-13%7 and Sr-90) in a fissilion reactor the dis-

cussion below points to a more optimistic conclusion.

The calculation of the transmutations of F.P. nuclides 1s made on

the basis of the following more or less arbitrary assumptions:

1)

The total number of fission power reactors installed must form
a self sustaining system (a breeding system) with a compound
doubling time Ts of about 30 years (at a later date in the

development of cur civilization this may be satisfled).

T _ 2.75 - M - (1 + F) . 1p o

 

S (BR-1) - (1 + a) C
TS = compound doubling time (years)
M = initial fuel loading (kg/MW th)
C = fraction of time that reactor is at full power
B = ratio of the fertile isotope fission rate
o = capture to fission ratio for the fissile material
BR = breeding ratio
Prom this BR = 1 + oxtl2 M - (L +F) - In 2

 

T (1 + a) = C
We have postulated:
TS = 30 years

and we know that the mean values for 'our reactor' are

F = 0.20 (instead of 0.3, sece Beynon 1974)
a = 0.24

M = 1 kg Pu/Mith

C = 0.8

and we obtailn

BR = 1.077

12

We know that the breeding ratio can be defined as

(v=-1-a) + (F{(v'-1)) - (A+L+T)

 

BR =

v and v' = number of neutrons per flssion
A = ratio of parasitic capture rate in structural material

to fission 1n fissile material

T = ratio of parasitic capture rate in transmutated F.P.

to fission in fissile material

L = leakage ratio

 

In this paper the following rather For illustration only

., Which fission products are candidates for transmutation?

In our case the amount of transmutatable nuclide can equal

T = 0.307

The tables of (BNWL-1900) provide the data for Fig. 4 in which
the radiocactivity of a ¥.P. after a very short 'cooling' time
is seen, from which it is clear that the main hazard arises from

only a few radionuclides.

But these radionuclides nevertheless cconstitute the global
hazard even taking the amounts produced during the next period

of nuclear energy development.

The crucilal nuclides are characterised in Table 3 together with
other isctopes. All this data now makes 1t possible to estimate
the number of candidates for transmutation in our breeder/

burner system. The criteria are as follows

- the total amount of all transmutated nuclides cannot be
bigger than the estimated value of T = 0.3%367, that is
~36 atoms of F.P. nuclides for each 100 fissioned

nuclides.

- the priority of ftransmutation is given as follows

Cs>Sr>I>Te>Kr Total equals: T = 0,3318

- in the first instance no isotopic separation process is

postulated.

Table % shows the F.P. nuclides selected for transmutation.

(see also Fig. 4).

5. 1Is the rate of transmutation good enough?

 

1t 1s clear that the rate of radiocactive nuclide removal in a

field of particles is given by:

ln 2

eff = Adecay ¥ Atransmutation (s l) T —
t 1/2 (eff)

where
Ktrans - Gtrans 0
. 2 . .
o = c¢ross section (cm ) for a given reaction
¢ = flux of the reacting particles (cmngs_l)

Let us assume that the energy production 1s based on a set of n
burners and nX breeders (see §3). At time tn (see Fig. 5) when
1t 1s decided to stop fission energy production in favour of

other sources the total amount of a selected fission product is

(1) N(t) = X+ Lns
el
with K = YP/E
Y = yield of the selected F.P.
P = power per burner (or breeder) (watt)
E = energy per fission {(Joule)

This amount of F.P. 1s located only in the burners, therefore,
each burner can receive (¥ + l)%eff although their own produc-
tion should represent only T in the steady state.

eff
At time tn the nX breeders are shut down and cnly n burners are
in operation. Later on (time tn_l) the nuclide removal 1s
such that a rearrangement 1s possible and one burner can be
stopped, 1ts F.P. content will be loaded in the remaining burners

etc. At the beginning of each time step, tp’ the p burners which

One could imagine other schemes: for example one could make the re-
arrangement only when 2 burners can be shutdown. From the reacti-
vity point of view this solution i1s worse than the proposed one.

Coming back to the original proposal one has still to solve at

each time step (tp, tp_l) the burn up equation.
(3) ad + Reff N = K.p where the right hand side 1is the F.P.

Then the solution is

(p-1).

With x = 4,n = 100 which means the economy was based before tn

on 400 breeders, the initial F.P. amount is reduced 415 times

when the last burner is shutdown. Then the required time is defined
by Aeff (to - tn) = §.9% (8.76 with the approx expression (61).

Since the most hazardous F.P. nuclides are those which apart from
their high metabolic activity and high retention in living organisms
also have a half life of the same order as a human 1life span of
60-70 years we arrive at the following list of hazardous isotopes

which are the most important for transmutation.

The most important problem arises from the fact that the two nuc-

absorption in both the thermal and fast regions.

The question then arises, in what device are such fluxes possible -

to point out that during the period of 60 years which provides

the reduction factor of 415 (if the Aeff = H.?-lo_gs_l can be
achieved) the natural decay of Cs=137 would have reduced it only

by a Tactor 4 which demonstrates the efficiency of the burner.

6. In what reactors are the transmutations possible?

 

From the point of view of this paper the most important process
is the transmutation of some of these nuclides by neutrons 1in a
fission reactor. The criteria given in chapter 2 1limit the choice

of system. That is

a) the number of F.P. nuclei cannot be too large in relation to
the number of fissioned atoms in the burner reactor (reactor
for transmutation) because the latter process also produces

new fission products.

b) the fission reactor should be self-sustaining - that is a

breeding system.
c)

d)

25

the specific power of the reactor is proportional to the
neutron flux. High neutron flux means high specific power

which 1is controlled by the erfectiveness of the core cooling.

the specific power P and the neutron flux ¢ are coupled by the

fission cross section and the concentration of fissile nuclide

(N.)

For thermal neutrons Of is approx. 700 barns and for fast

neutrons only 1.8 barns, that is 400 times smaller.

For the given total power and the same specific power the

product N Yy for the thermal reactor must be approx. 400

times Smailer than for a fast reactor. Since the critical
concentration of fissile nuclides in a thermal reactor can
only be 10 times smaller than for a fast reactor then for a
given specific power the neutron flux in a fast reactor can

be about 40 times higher than that of a thermal reactor.

The cross section for thermal neutrons for the nuclides con-
sidered here is from 3 to 10 times larger than in a fast

flux and this must be taken into account.

All these factors bring us to the following solution of the

problems under discussion.

a)

The highest specific power and hence the highest neutron flux
is possible if the cooling process is carried out by the fuel

itself and not by a separate ccoling agent only.

This directs our interest towards a reactor with molten fuel

in spite of the exotic nature of this solution.

The first approximation is made for an isotopically pure radio-
nuclide e.g. Cs-137 without Cs-133% (stable) and Cs-135 and
also Sr-90 without Sr-88 (stable)

discussion then results in:

7. What are the limits of specific power Iin a solid fuelled

reactor?

5

Is the specific power of 15 KWem - achievable in a solid fuel

reactor? These are the self-evident limits in solid fuelled

reactors:

a) rate of burning of fissile nuclides limited due to depletion

of fissilile or an increase of F.P. nuclides.
b) heat transfer limitation of fuel/clad to coolant

c) temperature and temperature gradients in the fuel and

cladding (melting, mechanical properties)
d) bolling of coolant

e) limitation of coolant velocity, pumping power, stability

Now we discuss these limitations in more detail

a) the dwell time in a solid fuelled reactor in core for the

fissile nuclides must not be too short.

Using now a simplified model for the first guess of the tempera-
ture gradient we can say: the amount of heat generated in the
fuel must be the same as leaving the surface of the cladding-

material.

Where s = wall thickness and A = heat conductivity (w-cm_l-K_l)

an optimistic value for stainless steel is Xx = 0.4 W-cm_l-K“l.

ATclad - 9000 * —6TE = 675 C

It is evident that this result is not realistic.

 

The soluticon of thils problem may be the thermalisation of neutrons
in a high flux fast core and the irradiation of Cs-137 in a thermal

trap (see Fig. 7).

In such a thermal trap we postulate (which must be based later

on core calculation)

Gth = l.e - mfast

_ 16 . _ 16 -2 -1
to reach @th = 6.0-10 we require ®fast = 5.0-10 n cm S

For this fast flux the specific power can be assumed, 1f we
take into account the effective increase of the fissilon cross

section because of the influence of the thermal trap. The simpli-

The corresponding heat-flux 1s therefore reduced to

It is also evident that this result 1s not realistic!

 

The resulting thermal stress in the cladding wall coupled with the

high flux 1s prohibitive.

c¢) Impact of the thermal flux tail in the fast neutron solid fuel core

Here, the most important problem 1s the local overheating by the
thermal flux present at the interface of fthe thermal column and
the solid fuel core., If, in the fast region near to the interface
approx., 20% of the energy comes from the thermal neutrons, the

following ratio of fluxes must be achileved:

 

 

Gth : gth 5(Ofast ' gfast) 0.2

55

That the thermal flux must be 2000 times lower than the fast,
would seem very difficult to realise. It is feasible in a liguid

fuel core, externally cooled.

d) The liquid-fuelled fast reactor with thermal trap

 

A much better solution is using a liguid-fuel. The %transfer of
the neal generated is done, by pumping and cooling the liquid

fuel out of core.

For a unit cell of 1 cm”, which in this case consists of fuel only,

we can write the following heat-balance.

— . . é_T_ . . - 3 . _3. -1
spec (p-c) W T (prc) = Heat capacity (J-cm K ™)
W = Veloclty of fuel (cm/s)
AT/ 1 = Temperature increase per

spec Speclfic power (Wecm ~)

If we allow in the core a temperature increase of AT/l ~3% deg-cm_l

. 21+10° (Weem ) L -1
W= R 1 - 5H m.s
2.0 (Jdeem 7K 7)) » % (K+cm 7)

 

This velocity appears to be within the limits of LANE who in 1969
proposed a fuel-velocity of 40 m.sec_l for a reactor with 10 kw.cm_3
specific power. This point however has to be seriously investigated,

as erosion due to high velocities is a problem,
56

3

For a 7000 MW(th) core with a specific power of 21 XW-cm ° the

fuel volume is about %30 liters.

The target volume, that is the volume of irradiated (transmuted)
fission products e.g. Cs-137, 1s postulated as 1300 liters. The
diameter of a spherical core 1s therefore 146 cm. The temperature
increase of the unit cell of fuel, in one pass through the core,

equals approximately

-1 _ 0
ATfuel %3 (deg.cm ) - 146 (em) = 438 ~C

and for an fuel inlet temperature of 550 OC we reach an outlet

temperature of approx. 988 °c.

The idea of a liquid fuel high flux reactor has been discussed
for some years. LANE (1971) for example writes about high flux

fast reactors:

"As an alternative some consideration has been given at Oak Ridge
to the possibility of using a molten salt reactor as a fast flux
test facllity. The primary virtue of this approach includes the
ability to achieve very high power densitlies and at the same
time eliminate the down time associated with refuelling the
reactor. A fast spectrum molten salt reactor however requlres a
high fissile concentration (1.e. 300 to 500 g 235U/litre) in
order to get mean neutron energies in the range of 10 to 50 keV.
Switching from an NaF - UFL1 salt (on which the energy range just

mentioned is based) to a chloride-salt reactor would permit a

 

higher mean energy for the same fuel concentration but would
require the development of a new technology assoclated with the

use of chlorides.
57

Since the fast flux level is largely determined by the power
density a flux of the order of 1016 Or more corresponds to a
peak power density in the fuel salt in a range of 5 to 10 MW/
litre and to a power level of about 1000 MW(th). This means
that there will be only 100 to 200 litres in the core: however

the external volume would be about 10,000 litres™.

8. How could such a high flux fast reactor with circulating

liquid fuel and thermal column operate as burner?

 

'he details will be given in the second part of this report

(see also HFig. 7 and 8).

9. What engineering problems must be solved for this to be

realised

 

Short life of the structure materials because of nuclear trans-
formatilon in these materials, due to the extremely high neutron

flux. The details will be given in the second part of this report.
