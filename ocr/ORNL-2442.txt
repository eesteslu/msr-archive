THERMAL STRESS ANALYSIS OF THE ART HEAT EXCHANGER
CHANNELS AND HEADER PIPES

This report summarizes the study which was made to determine the
stresses; deflections, and the forces and moments acting on the ART
heat exchanger channels and header pipes due to relative thermal expan-

sion between the channels and the pressure shell at full power operation.

Introduction
Figure 1 shows a sketch of a channel and header pipes, and a portion

of the pressure shell to which they are connected. During full power
operation the temperature of the channel will be higher than that of the
pressure shell, and thereby produce relative thermal expansion. The
resulting forces and moments will cause deformation of the channel, the
header pipes, and the thermal sleeves which connect the pipes to the pres-
sure shell, ‘The stresses due to these loads will be transmitted to the
incoming NaK piping.

Figure 2 shows the idealized system used for the analysis. The
channel was treated as a semi-circular-arc curved-beam connected directly
to the header pipes, which were treated as cantilever beams. This analysis
assumes that there is no deformation in the incoming NaK piping, or in the -
thermal sleeves. It is expected that this assumption will yield an ade~
quate initial estimate for the analysis of the channel.

Because of symmetry it was sufficient to consider only one-half of
the channel and one header pipe. The channel was assumed fixed at the
mid-point and the deflections due to the relative thermal expansion were

applied to the system. Elastic theory was assumed for all calculations.

Thermal Expansions

 

The total vertical expansion of the channel relative to the
pressure shell was reported in ART Design Memo 8«D-5 as 82 mils.
This was assumed to be distributed equally between the sections
above and below the mid-point, so that 41 mils was the vertical
deflection used in the calculations.

For the radial expansion, the channel was assumed to be at an
average temperature of 1&250F’and the pressure shell at 1240°F,
Taking the radial position of the header pipes to be 19.59 inches,
this gives a radial deflection of 32 mils.

Method of Analysis

Deflection equations were written to determine the forces and

 

moments acting on the channel at point b, from the thermal expansions

applied between points a and c. The coordinate system is shown in
Fig. 3. Since the channel is free to grow radially, forces were not

applied in the y-direction. The modes of deformation included in-

plane and out-of-plane bending of the channel from flexure and torsion

and deformation of the header pipe by flexure and torsion.

The deflections for point b due to deformation and rotation of the

channel may be expressed by the following equations, in which the sub-

scripts refer to the modes of deflection.

The relative thermal expansions applied between points a and c
must be equal to the differences in the deflections of point b caused
by deformations of the channel and those caused by deformations of the
header pipe. Hence, the following relations may be written, in which
the subscfipts T and H refer to the appiied relative therm@l expansions

and the deflections due to deformation of the header pipe, réspectivelyl,

By expressing the deflections in Eqs (6) through (10) in terms of
the loads acting on the channel at point b, a set of equations results
from which these loads may be determined. Since the rigid body rotation
of the plane of the channel about the y-axis is an unknown in addition
to the five loads ij Fz’ Mk, My and Mz’ an additional equation is re-

quired, and may be written by summing moments about the y-axis.

Deflections From In-Plane Bending of Channel

 

It is seen from Fig. 3; that the force and moment producing in-
plane bending of the channel are P and MN° These may be resolved into

forces and moments parallel to the coordinate axes.

8y = - 0.0373 in.

This result indicates that the channel will expand 37 mils towards Shell V,
at the equator; in addition to the free relative thermal expansion reported
in ART Design Memo 8-D-5. |

Since there are no forces on the channel in the y-direction, the y-
deflection at b, relative to the actual coordinate system, is zero.

The x-deflection at b can be calculated by summing the in-plane and
cut-of-plane x-deflections for the channel, or from the deflection of the

header pipe. Taking the latter, and using Eq (40),

Thermal stresses are produced in the header pipe from radial
and axial temperature gradients, in addition to those caused by relative
thermal expansion of the channel. Figure 6 shows the north and south
headers and pipes with the approximate temperatures of the surrounding
fluids.

The axial temperature gradients should be small except in the
regions close to the headers which are subjected to cross-flow from the
fuel. Because of the azimuthal variation in heat transfer coefficients
and the complicated geometry of these regions, it is possible that
thermal cycling of these small sections of pipe could occur. Although
these temperature fluctuations would be difficult to calculate, small
thermal shields welded to the headers might be warranted.,

Because the layer of fuel surrounding the header pipes over most
of their lengths is very thin, an estimate of the radial temperature
profiles may be calculated using simple conduction with semi-infinite
slab geometry. With the temperatures indicated in Fig. 6, these cal-
culations give temperature differences across the walls of 230F and 52?F
for the north and south header pipes, respectively. The stresses in

the outside walls due to these gradients can be calculated by

giving - 4574 psi for the north header pipe, and 6176 psi for the south.
The bending and twisting stresses may now be combined with the

stresses due to the radial temperature gradient in the header pipe in

order to get the maximum normal and shear stresses, Figure 7 shows

the fixed end of the header pipe, the direction of the resultant bending

moment, and the bending stresses due to MH' Since the twisting stresses

and temperatuniafggﬁfnt stresses are uniformly distributed around the
header pipe, the direction of MH determines the location of the maximum
stresses in the pipe. For the north header pipe, the temperature
gradient stresses are compressive at the outside wall, so the maximum
stresses occur where the bending stress is a maximum in compression,
This element is at the outside wall, 900 clockwise from the direction

of - MH and an angle @ counterclockwise frbm the positive y-axis, where

For the south header, the temperature gradient stresses are tensile
at the outer wall, so the maximum stresses occur where the bending
stress is a maximum in tension. This point is 180° from the point of
maximum stress in the north header pipe, or an angle @ counter clock-
wise from the negative y-axis, when the south header pipe is oriented
as in Fig. 7 (eg the z-axis is directed away from the equator)..

The maximum stresses can be calculated for the north and south
header pipes from the combined stresses acting on the elements in the
outer walls of the header pipes, as shown in Fig. 7. The stresses
acting on these elements are shown in Fig. 8. The maximum normal and

shear stresses are given by

Evaluation of Torsional Rigidity Factor, K

For a narrow rectangular beam of length b and width c, K can be

approximated using the membrane analogy to give

K = %bc2 (B1)

Similarly, for a narrow trapezoidal section”,

1 2 2
K = i§-bl(cl + C2)(Cl + c2) (B2)

. For a cross=-section built up of narrow elements, K can be
approximated by summing the K's for the individual elementslo.
Thus, for the channel (Fig. 4), by summing two trapezoidal sections

and one rectangle,
