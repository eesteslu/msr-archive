SUMMARY

This report contains a summary of all the experimental density measure-
ments on molten fluoride mixtures that have been developed for the Aircraft
Nuclear Propulsion Project A correlation of these data 1s presented whaich
can be used to predict liquid densities of fluoride mixtures of known compo-~
sition over wide, elevated temperature ranges

Experimental measurements were made by the buoyancy principle using
a plummet suspended in the molten salts from an analytical balance, the
entire system being enclosed in a dry-box

All the information avallable on compositions, experimental densities,
melting points and cubical coefficients of expansion may be found in this
report, calculated values of liquid and room temperature densities, mo-
lecular weights and molecular volumes of all the mixtures that have been

developed fqor the ANP program are also presented

 
IRTRODUCTION

Since the outset of the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion project, interest has
been centered on molten fluoride mixtures as the best potential circulating
fluids for use i1n high temperature reactors of the ARE type Durang the course
of the project, some fifty or more mixtures of fluorides have been suggested
and a number of these aroused sufficient interest to merit measurements off
their physical properties

In the early stages of the density research program the experimental
accuracy was somewhat lower than in the later stages During the former
Period some questions concerning purity of both the molten salts and the
blanketing atmosphere arose Also, the techniques of temperature measurement
and control, and weighing facilities were refined during the latter period
As a result, the more recent determinations afford a somewhat higher degree
of accuracy than the earlier ones

The correlation descraibed in this report i1s based on measurements on
all the mixtures that have been studied In a few instances, notably compo-
sition No 12 (Flinak), 1t has been possible to make a second set of measure-
ments on a mixture for which the properties had been measured very early in
the project, and i1n these instances the data listed below are the revised

values In past reports on several of the compositions, a correction based

 
. - T- o9

on the volume change of the plummet with temperature was omitted, the error
introduced being well within the accuracy claimed for the data  However, this
correction has been applied where necessary in this report and i1t 1s suggested
that i1n subsequent studies involving the densities of fluorides, the data

in this report be used

The volume of liquid displaced by the plummet, vy, 1s also equal to the

started Values for pHgO and Bp are known, values of WL at the various tempera-
tures were measured

The experimental data are given i1n Table 1 and in Figure 3 where the
temperature range over which measurements were made on each mixture is shown
The experimental data are also tabulated in Teble 4 in the form of equation (7)
A simple analysis indicates that these data are probably not in error by more
than + 5% Experimental values for the coefficients of cubical expansion of

the various liquids may be found in Table 1

fine steel wire from a Voland 'Speedigram" balance (a chainomatic balance on
which weights larger than 100 mg are controlled mechanically by knobs with no
loss 1in accuracy) The plummets were fabricated from 1/4" No 316 stainless
steel rod The containers for the molten salts were fabricated from 1 1/2'

I P S, Schedule 40, No 316 stainless steel pipe The tube furnace was
mounted on a small rolling platform equipped with ball-bearing casters to
facilitate centering of the tube under the balance as well as under the two
systems for determining viscosities which were also housed in the dry-box
(Both density and viscosity measurements were made during the same heat-up
period Viscosity studies will be discussed in a separate report)

The temperature of the melt was measured with the aid of two chromel-
alumel thermocouples and a Brown multipoint recorder, the couples were inserted
in wells made of 1/8’ stainless tubing and supported in the liquid salt so
that one couple was 2-3 inches below the surface and the other 5-6 inches
below the surface The wire supporting the plummet was of such length that
the plummet was suspended at a depth between the two couples Temperature
of the furnace was controlled by a combination of a variac and a
Simplitrol with a chromel-alumel thermocouple The hot Jjunction of thais
couple was 1mbedded 1n the outside surface of a thick-walled copper pipe used
as a thermal diffuser between the heating surfaces of the tube furnace and
the tube containing the melt Since this hot junction "sees' the heating
element face, a very semnsitive temperature control was afforded As the

experiment progressed, the temperature setting was increased by a small

increment and in a short time the temperatures indicated by the two immersed
thermocouples rose to a point slightly below that set on the Simplitrol,
leveled off and approached each other, at this point the two readings were
usually no more than 5 degrees apart  After this practically isothermal con-
dition was reached, a weight reading and the average temperature were recorded
Since the fluorides in the molten state are very sensitive to the atmos-
phere, a number of precautions were taken to insure 1ts purity Argon was
circulated through the dry-box and out of & bubbler at a measured rate until
the calculated concentration of argon was above 99 9% These calrulations
have been checked experimentally by measuring the oxygen concentration of the
gas 1n the dry-box with a Burrell Gas Analyzer Effort was made to remove
the final traces of oxygen and water, these being the chief undesirable
impurities, by placing indicating Drierite from a closed container into a
flat open dish to get the water and by starting up an oxygen removal device
consisting of a tube furnace containing a cartridge of copper filings and
equipped with a 15 CFM blower The filings were brought to red heat and the
atmosphere in the dry-box circulated over them  Purity ofﬁthe atmosphere,
which determines the purity of the melt, 1s indicated by the appearance of
the plummet when 1t 1s withdrawn from the melt  The plummet, though dis-
colored, will have a clean smooth surface when taken from a clean melt No
difficulty was encountered with condensation on the wire except during measure-
ments on mixtures containing ZrF)  When working with these salts, the plummet
was removed between weighings and the tube containing the melt was covered

to retard the zirconium snow effect

EXPLANATION OF THE CORRELATION

Although more than fifty different fluoride mixtures have been developed
since the initiation of the ANP program, density measurements have heen made
on only fifteen of these mixtures 1In addition, new mixtures are developed
as the program continues For these reasons i1t was felt that a method for
predicting densities of molten fluorides would be useful and the correlation
described below was developed

The correlation 1s based on plots of the experimentally determined liquid
densities at any one temperature against the calculated densaities of the corre-
sponding mixture at room temperature These room temperature densities are

calculated by the formula

o = =l (9)

where,

p, density at room temperature of the mixture
(gm/cc)

My, molecular welghtl of a component of the
mxture (gm/mol )

f,, mol fraction of that component

p,, density at room temperaturel of that component
(em/ce)

 

lThe values used for the various components are listed in Table 2
of the appendix

3 4 9§ Sy
- 36 - b

The numerator 1s the calculated molecular weight of the mixture and the
denominstor 1s the calculated molecular volume of the mixture Values of

the room temperature density calculated from this formuls were checked against
experimentally determined values for a series of 10 fluoride mixtures and
were found to differ by no more than + 5 percent (Reference 1)

Figure 3 gives the density-temperature data for all of the liquid fluoride
mixtures that have been studied to date (References 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12) The figures in parentheses are the calculated room temperature
densities The data given in Table 1 were used in drawing these curves It
1s noted that the average liquid densaities are proportional to the calculated
room temperature densities of the corresponding mixtures

Figures 4a, 4b, Yc and 4d represent plots of liquid densities against
the calculated room temperature densities of corresponding mixtures at 600°C,
700°C, 800°C and 900°C respectively, these 1sotherms were cross-plotted from
Figure 3 Figure 5 1s a composite of figures lYa, Wb, 4ec and kd  Knowing
only the calculated room temperature density, the liquid density may be pre-
dicted for any mixture of fluorides over this temperature range

Figures 6 and 7 were derived from Figure 5 and give the constants, a and
b, for equation 7, as a function of the room temperature density

The density correlation presented here satisfactorily represents all the
experimental measurements on the fluoride mixtures, the mean deviation is

gbout % and the maximum deviation 1s 6% Table 3 gives the calculated room

2‘Ven.lue is for TOOOC unless otherwise noted  The calculated range of
cubical expansion coefficients 1s from 3 6 x 10-%* 1/°C to
2 4 x 10°% 1/0C The few experimental values which fall outside of
this range probably do so because they are based on early or incomplete
sets of data
