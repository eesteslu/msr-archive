AN EVALUATION OF THE MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR EXPERIMENT
- “HASTELIOY N SURVEILLANCE SPECIMENS — SECOND GROUP

H. E. McCoy, Jr.
ABSTRACT

_ ‘We have examined the second group of Hastelloy N surveila
lance samples removed from the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment.
Two rods of standard Hastelloy N were removed from the surveilw
lance position outside the core vessel and were exposed to the
nitrogen plus 2 to 5% 0, cell enviromnment for 11,000 hr. Metal-

lographic examingtion showed that the alloy was compatible with

this environment, showing'only superficial oxidation and no
evidence of nitriding. - These samgles were exposed to a thermal
fluence of 1.3 x 10*? neutrons/cm and the mechanical proper-
ties were altered appreciably. Both tensile and creep tests
were run that showed significant changes in the mechanical
properties, particularly the strain at fracture. These changes
are in good agreement with those observed for materials irra-
diated in a helium environment in the Osk Ridge Research Reactor.

Two rods of modified Hastelloy N‘contaiﬁing small additions
of titanium and zirconium.were removed from the core surveillance

 facility with a thermal fluence of 4.1 x 10%° neutrons/cm?.

These materials had not been annealed properly to put them in
their most radiation-resistant condition, but tests on these
materials indicated that they have sllghtly improved postirra-
diation mechanical propertles and that their corrosion resistance
is acceptable

- INTRODUCTION

The Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment is a single- reglon reactor '

P

that is fueled by a molten fluorlde salt (65 LiF—29 1 BeF2—5 ZrF4—O 9 UF,,
L mole %), moderated by unclad graphlte, and contalned by Hastelloy N
5 (N;—lé Mo—7 Cr—4 Fe+0.05_C,_wt_%). The details of the reactor des1gn

 
 

 

 

and construction can be found elsewhere.l We knew that the neutron
environment would produce some changes in the two structural materials —
graphite and Hastelloy N, and we were very confident of the compatibility
of these materials with the fluoride salt, However, we needed to keep
abreasﬁ‘of the possible development of problems within the reactor itself.
For these reasons, we developed a surveillance progfam'that would allow
us to follow any changes in properties of graphite and Hastelloy N
specimens as the reactor operated

The reactor went critical on June 1, 1965, and assumed normal opera-
tion in May 1966, The first group of surveillance specimens was in the
reactor from September 8, 1965, to July 28, 1966, and was removed after
8682 Mwhr of operation (designated "first group"). The results of our
tests on the Hastelloy N specimens were reported previously.2 A second
set of specimens was removed from the core on May 9, 1967, after an
additional 27,600 Mwhr of operation (total reactor operation was
36,247 Mwhr), These specimens were two modified alloys containing
nominal 0.5% additions of titanium and zirconium. These were inserted
on September 13, 1966, after the first group was removed to determine the
mechanical property changes of these alloys due to irradiation and to
evaluate the compatibility of these alloys with the MSRE énvironmentﬂ
Two rods of standard ﬁastelloy N located outside the core and 5 in. from
the vessel were removed on June 5, 1967. These specimens had been in
place-since the reactor began operation and were examined to deﬁermine
the compatibility of the material with the MSRE cell environment
(N» + 2=5% 0,) and the changes in the mechanical properties due to
irradiation.

This report will describe the results of tests on the Hastelloy N
surveillance specimens removed during May and June 1967 (designated
"second group"), which includes two rods of modified (zirconium and
titanium) alloys removed from the core and two rods of standard

Hastelloy N removed from outside the core vessel.

. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

. Surveillance Assembly

The core sﬁrveillahee assembly was.designed by W. H. Cook and others,
and the details have been reported 3  fThe facility is shown pictorially
and schematically in Flg. 1.  The specimens are arranged in three
stringers. Each strlnger 1s about 62 in. long and consists of two
Hastelloy N rods and a graphite section made up of various pleces that
are joined by plnnlng and tongue-and-groove joxnts. The Hastelloy N
rod is periodically reduced to 0.125 in. in dismeter and can be cut into

small tensile specimens'after it is removed from the reactor; Three

7stringers are joined tbgether_Sorthat they can be separated in a hot

cell and resssembled with one or more new stringers for reinsertion into
the reactor. The assembled;stringers fit into a perforated Hastelloy N
basket that is inserted into an axial position about 2.8 in. from the
core center line. | _' | |

When the basket was removed on July 28 1966, some of the specimens

were bent, and the entire assembly had to be replaced.4 Slight modifica-

~tions in the design were made, and the assembly was removed recently and

found to'be in excellent condition.®
A control facility is associated with the surveillance program. It

utilizes a "fuel salt" containing depleted uranium in a static pot that

is heated electrically., The temperature is controlled by the MSRE com-
- puter so that the temperature matches that of the reactor Thus, these
, specimens are exposed to condltlons ‘the same as those 1n the reactor

*p'except for the statlc salt and the absence of a neutron flux.r

Fig. 1. Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment Core Surveillance Fixture.

There is another surveillance facility for Hastelloy N located out-
side the core in a vertical position asbout 5 in. from the vessel (Fig. 2).

These specimens are exposed to the cell environment (N, + 2—5% 03).

Materiagls

The compositions of the two heats of standard Hastelloy N are given

in Table 1. These heats were air melted by Materials Systems Division of
Union Carbide Corporation. Heat 5085 was used for making the cylindrical
portion, and heat 5065 was used for the top and bottom heads of the MSRE
vessel. These materials were given a mill anneal of 1 hr at 1177°C and
s Pinal anneal of 2 hr at 900°C at ORNL after fabrication. |

- The chemical coﬁpositions of the two modified alloys are given in
Table 1. The modifications in composition were made principally to

improve the alloy's resistance to radiation damage'and to bring about

Both procedures resulted in a very fine grain size (ASTM grain size
7 to 9).

Test Specimens

The surveillance rods inside the core are 62 in. long and those out-
side the vessel are 81 in. long. They both are 1/4 in. in diameter with
reduced sections 1/8 in. in diameter by 1 1/8 in. long. After removal
from the reactor, the rods aré sawed into small mechanical property'
specimens having a gage seetion 1/8 in. in diaméter\by 1 1/8 ih.\lbng.

The first rods were machined in small segments_tapprox 11 1/2 in.
long) and welded together. An improvement in this technique has been_

made that allows the entire rod to be machined as a unit (see Fig. 3).

A milling machine is used with a cutter-gfound to the shape of the gage
length, including the radius vhere the gage length blends into the full
1/4 in. dismeter of the rod. The rod is held in position and rotated

. while being fed into the milling cutter. The rod then requires only ‘a

light hand polishing of the gage sections to obtain the desired surface

- finish. This procedure is quicker, cheaper, and requires less handling

of the relatlvely fraglle rods than the previous method of making the

rods from segments.

Irradiation Conditions

The irradiation conditions in the core were described in detail
previously.’ These measurements were repegted for the second group of
‘core specimens and found to be in excellent agreement. The specimens

outside the core are exposed to the cell environment of N + 2=5% 0p. )

. The pertinent temperature and flux data are summerized in Tsble 2.

| Testing Techniques

The laboratory creep-rupture tests were run in conventional creep
machines of the dead-ioad'andrlever;arm'types. The strain was measured
by a dial indicator that showed the total movement of the spec1men and
part of the load:train. The zero strain measurement was taken immedi-

ately after the load was app;ied; The temperature accuracy was +0.75%,

_the guaranteed accuracy of the Chromel-P—Alumel thermocouples used.

The postirradlatlon creep-rupture tests were run 1n lever-arm

',rmachines that were located in hot .cells, The strain was measured byvan
7extensometer with rods attached ‘to the upper and ‘lower specimen grips.
The relative movement of these two rods was measured by & linear differ-

Vential transformer, and the transformer signal was recorded, The

~ accuracy of the strain_measnrements is difficult to determlne; ‘The

- extensometer (mechanicaleand electrical portions) produced measurements

that could be read to about +0.02% strain; however, other factors (tem-
perature changes in the cell mechanical vibratlons, etce. ) probably
combined to give an overall accuracy of 0. 1% strain, This is consid-
erably better than the speclmen-to specimen reproduc1bllity that one

would expect for relatively brittle materials. The temperature measuring

Qand control system was the same as.that used in the laboratory with only

one exception.\ In the laboratory, the control system was stabilized at

the desired temperature by use of a recorder with an expanded scale In

-the tests in the hot cells,”the control point was established by settlng ’

the controller without the aid of the expanded-scale recorder.- This error

~and the thermocouple'accuracy combine to give a temperature uncertainty

of about +1%.

The ten31le tests were run on Instron Universal Testing Machines.
The strain measurements were taken from the crosshead travel,
, The test env1ronment was air in all’ cases. Metallographic examing-
tlon showed that the depth of oxidation was small and we feel that the

env1ronment did not apprec1ably influence the test results

‘Small pieces of the modified alloys removed from the core were
examined metallographically Photomicrographs of heat 21554 (zirconium
modified) are shown in Fig. 5. The bulk material is characterized by a
very fine grain size and small inhomogeneouS'areas that were found to be
essentially pure ‘molybdenum (probably a result of poor melting practice).

The as=polished sample shows some very slight microstructural changes

- near the surface to a depth of 1 to 2 mils., Similar micrographs_are

shown in Fig' 6 for heat 21545 (titanium modified) The grain size of
this material is slightly smaller, but the other features are quite

similar to those observed for heat 21554

A small piece of the basket that contained the surveillance assembly
was examined.metallographically ' The basket was made from perforated .
Hastelloy N sheet. The entire surface exposed to the salt is character-
ized by the photomicrographs shown in Fig. 7. Small grains appeared to

. be almost dislodged from the surface [Fig. 7(a)]. After etching, a fine

precipitate was revealed near the surface to a depth of 1 to 2 mils.

We examined the_material,used,in.fabricating the basket; the micrOStruc-,
ture is shown in Fig. 8. ‘There is some precipitate near the surface,
but not in the quantities-observed in Pig. 7. We aged'a'piece of the
materiel for 1000 hr at 650°C (basket in MSRE was exposed 5500 hr) and
found that the quantity of precipitate increased (Fig. 9) _-However,

we were not able to dislodge any grains near the surface. even after a

| very sharp cold bend.

A sample from the basket wa.s sent to N. R. Stalica, Argonne National

- Laboratory, for microprobe studies. This 1nvestigator found that the
- precipitates contained silicon and oxygen_in large concentrations and

- suggested that they were SiOg.. Our studies on the ﬁnirradiated:speCimens

showed that the precipitates are metal-silicon compounds.! We are contin-

uing to 1nvestigate this p01nt but presently feel that the. precipitates

‘iare probably related to surface contaminatlon of the basket during fabri-

- ‘cation. The 8111con-rich contaminant should be dissolved during the post-

fabrication anneal (approx 1177 C) given the basket. and subsequently

région. As shown in Fig. 11, tpe depth of attack seemed to be some-
what greater, but the reaction layer is very shallow, Neither specimen

showed any evidence of nitrogen absorption from the cell environment.

Mechanical Property Data — Standard Hastelloy N

The postirradiation tensile properties of heat 5065 are summarized
in Table 3., The fracture strains are plotted as a function of test
temperature in Fig. 12. There are significant reductions in the
fracture strain at 25°C and above 500°C. The properties of heat 5085
are given in Table 4. The fracture strains are plotted in Fig. 13 and
are very similar to those notédrfOr heat 5065. The strain at fracture

for both heats is reduced above about 400°C by reducing the strain rate.

Some 1dea of the rate of property deterioration with fluence can
be obtained by comparing the results for hea.t 5085 obtained this time
on specimens irradisted outmde__the vessel to a thermal fluence of
1.3 x 10'° neutrons/em? with those obtained previously® for specimens

removed from the core with a fluence of 1.3 x 102° neutrons/cm?. The

unknown effects on the properties due to different times at temperature

must be recognlzed the core specimens for 4800 hr and the vessel

spec:.mens for 11,000 hr.. The results are compared in Fig. 14.

1, the fracture strain is decreased

At a strain rate of 0.05 min~
appreciably as the thermal fluence increased from 1.3 X 101_9 to

1.3 X 1029 neutrons/cm®. At a slower strain rate of 0.002 min~!, the o
same trend holds, but the change is much smaller, If this same trend

persists to lower strain rates, the fracture strain in creep tests may

not be influenced significantly by fluence over the small range studied.

 

Our previous studies showed that the tensile properties of‘materials
irradiated in the MSRE and those irradiated in the ORR and ETR in a |
helium environment were similar, the only significant_differenée being
the reduction in fracture strain observed® at 25°C. The present results
are in good agreement with this conclusion. Our present studies also -
support previous observations® that the yield stress was unaffected by
irradiation and that the ultimate tensile stress was reduced sbout 10%
at low temperatures and progressively reduced further above 500°C to a
maximum of 30% at 850°C,

The results of several creep-rupture tests on the standard
Hastelloy N surveillance specimens from the second group are given in

Table 5. The stress-rupture properties are compared in Fig. 15 with

higher for the specimens irradiated outside the vessel to a thermal
fluence of 1.3 x 10° neutrons/em® when tested at high strain rates (12
to 300%/hr). At lower strain rates most of the fracture strains are in
the range of 1.5 to 2.5%. Comparison of the results for the two sets of
specimens shows the fracture strains to be slightly lower for the specimens
exposed to the higher fluence in the core. These results do not indicate
! the very pronounced ductility minimum at a strain rate of about 0.1%/hr

| that is noted for these same materials when irradiated in the ORR. The
very long thermal exposures involved may be responsible for this behavior;
thatris, about 5000 hr in the MSRE compared with only 1000 hr in the ORR.
Heat 5081 shows unusually high strains and exhibits the trend of

increasing strain with decreasing strain rate.

is considerably lower. The strong dependence of fracture strain on

at 600 to 700°C is higher for the modifled alloy. The ratios of the

‘various properties in the irradlated and unirradiated conditions are

shown in Fig. 20. The yleld and ultimate strengths were not affected
appreciably by 1rradiat10n. The ratio for the elongation at fracture
drops precipltously above about 600 C for standard Hastelloy N (ref. 10),

Vbut the very low elongatlon observed for the unirradlated zirconium-
7',mod1fied material at 760°C causes the ratio to be very high at this tem-
','perature. The behavior of the ratio for the reduction 1n area is quite

normal with the exceptlon of the reduction of this parameter by about 25%

'l:,at low temperature.

The tensile properties of the control specimens of heat 215457
(titanium modified) aré given in Tdble 8. The total elongation is shown
in Fig. 21 as a function of the test temperature. Therproperties are
quite similar to those observed for heat 21554 (Fig. 18, p. 31, and
Table 6, p. 30). The properties of the surveillance specimens are given
in Table 9, and the total elongation at fracture is shown graphically in
Fig. 22. The fracture elongations for this material are quite similar
to those shown in Fig. 19 for heat 21554."Thé ratio of the irradiated
to the unirradiated property is shown in Fig. 23. Generally the yield
strength is increased slightly by irradiation, and the tensile stress
is decreased. The elohgation at fracture is generally decreased, but
decreases precipitously sbove 600°C. However, the ratio at 760°C is
again high due to the extremely low elongation of the unirradiated
material. The ratio for the reduction in area is reduced sbout 30% at
low temperatures and decreases rapidly above 600°C.

Several creep-rupture tests have been run on both irradiated and
unirradiated specimens of heats 21554 and 21545, The results of tests
on these materials are given in Table 10 (annealed 100 hr at 871°C),
Table 11 (annealed 100 hr at 871°C and exposed to barren salt for
5500 hr at 650 + 10°C), and Table 12 (annealed 100 hr at 871°C and
exposed to MSRE enviromment for 5500 hr at 650 + 10°C)., The stress-
rupture properties of heat 21554 are compared in Fig. 24 for the various
conditions studied. The strength is reduced slightly by the long thermal
exposure to barren salt. Exposure to the MSRE environment reduces thé
rupture life at a given stress by about a factor of 10. The creep rates
of heat 21554 are compared in Fig. 25. The minimum creep rate is
increased slightly by the 5500 hr soak at about 650°C in the barren salt;
~ the same change is noted for the specimens removed from the MSRE.

- The creep-rupture properties of heat 21545 are shown in Fig. 26
for the various conditions studied. Just as noted for the zirconium-
modified alloy in Fig. 24, the rupture life of the titanium-modified
alloy is reduced slightly by the long soak in the barren salt and the
rupture life is reduced by a factor of 10 by exposure to the MSRE
- enviromment. The minimum creeprrate was not affected significantly by Q;j

any of the variables investigated, Fig. 27.

- The fracture strains of these materials in the unirradiated state

" under creep conditions are-excellent, ranging from 30 to 60% (Tables 10
- and 11). However, the fracture strains after irradiation are appreciably
less ranging from 1. 5 to 4.5% (Table 12) These Strains are generally
“higher than those obtained from standard Hastelloy N (Fig. 17 p. 29).

Photomicrographs of a specimen of heat 5085 that was tested in
creep at 650°C are shown in Fig. 33. The fracture is entirely inter- .
granular with a few cracks near the fracture. The thin reaction layer
near the surface is apparent in Fig. 33(b) and (c).

Both the control and the irradiated specimens from heats 21554 and
21545 were exposed to salt for 5500 hr. The microstructures of thesé
alloys before'stressing were shown in Figs. 5 and 6, pp. 14 and 15. The
microstructure of a specimen from heat 21554 that was tested at 25°C is
shown in Fig. 34. The fracture was predominately transgranular., There
was a layer near the surface of the specimen that showed.eXten§;ve
intergranular cracking [Fig. 34(b) and (c)]. A typical phbtamicrograﬁh'
of the control sample is shown in Fig. 35. The fracture is a typical
ductile shear type and there is no appreciable edge cracking.

The microstructure of a specimen of heat 21554 tested at 650°C is
illustrated in Fig. 36. rThe fracture is intérgranular and ielatively_
brittle in appearance [Fig. 36(a)]. The edge cracking is quite extensive
at this temperature also. The fracture of the control specimeh'(Fig.;37)
is mixed intergranular-transgranular. There.is some edge crécking,\but
not at the frequency noted for the irradiated sample [Fig. 36(b)].

At a test temperature of 850°C, the fracture strain for heat 21554
after irradiation was higher than at 650°C. The microstructures shown in
Fig. 38 for the specimen tested at 850°C support this obser?ation. The
fracture is entirely intergranular with extensive intergranular cracking
throughout the sample. The edge cracking is not quite aé severe at this
temperature [Fig. 38(b) and (¢)]. The fracture of the control sample
is shown in Fig. 39. The original grain structure has been fragmented
completely because of the very high mobility of the grain boundaries
at this temperature. |

" The microstructural features of heat 21545 were quite similar to
those for heat 21554, Typical photomicrographs for heat 21545 are shown
in Figs. 40 through 45 for fensile test temperatures of 25, 650, and 850°C.
Significaht features are the shear fracture at 25°C in the irradiated

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS

The stendard Hastelloy N used in constructing the MSRE continuee to
show excellent compatlblllty W1th the fluorlde salt environment and ‘the
| cell env1ronment con51st1ng of NQ-Q to 5% 02.‘ There was no evidence of
n1tr1d1ng, and the depth of oxidation in 11,000 hr was only a fEW'mllS.‘
We knew from prev1ous studies that the mechanlcal propert;es of Hastelloy N
would detericrate due to irrediation damage.lz‘17 Our examination of.the
first group of surveillance specimens18 showed that the property changes
ﬁere as-predicted, the only exception being & reduction in- the ductility
at 25°C. Extraction replicas showed. that-extensive'carbide'brecipitatien
occurred along the grain boundaries durlng irradiation at 650°C, and. thls
probably accounts for the reduction in ductlllty at 25°C, oo

Our primary purpose in this program is to contlnually assess the?

condition of the MSRE core vessel. The surveillance facility in the core

receives a thermal flux about a factor of 40 higher than that received
by the vessel. The first surveillance specimens removed from the core
received a thermal fluence’of 1.3 x 1020 neutrons/cm? while being heated
for 4800 hr. The surveillance specimens of standard Hastelloy N removed
with the second group were located outside the core and received a thermal
fluence of 1.3 x 101° neutrons/cm while being heated for 11,000 hr. The
. latter group should indicate more closely the properties of the vessel,
but a comparison of the properties of both groups is important in trying
to estimate the future properties. The fracture strain in tensile tests
- (Fig. 14, p. 25) is reduced'even more by the.higher‘fluence. In creep-
rupture tests at 650°C (Fig. 15, p. 27), the rupture life is also slightly
shorter and the strain at fracture (Fig. 17, p. 29) slightly less for the
specimen irradiated to the higher fluence. In the unirradiated condition,
| heat 5085 exhibited fracturepstralns of 20 to 40% in creep-rupturetests
cqmpared with fracture strains of about 2.2 and l.ﬁ% after irradiation to
‘thermal fluences of 1.3 x 10° neutrons/cm® and 1.3 x 102° neutrons/cm?,
respectively.‘ Thus; even though-the properties continue'to change
slightly with increasing flnence, the rate oflchange has decreased
_markedly I ' | o
- Another encouraging observation is that the MSRE materials do not
seem to have as low minimum fracture strains after irradiation as we
have noted for the same materials after irradiation to the same fluences-
in the ORR (Fig. 17, p. 29). ‘This may be due to the more extensive
carbide precipitation in the materials irradiated in the MSRE for long
.periods of time. _ o
- The modified alloys, heats 21554 (zirconlum.modlfied) and 21545
(titanium.modified), were annealed to produce a.small grain size.
~_Since these samples were placed in the MSRE we have found that material
"'annealed ‘to produce & coarser grain size has better properties after

_1rradiation.19 Thus we were not surprised that the postirradlation |

properties of the modified alloys were not much better than those observed
for the standard Hastelloy N. However, two encouraging observations were
‘made that demonstrate the sbsence of embrittling aging reactions: (1) the
mechanical properties of the control specimens exposed,to'salt for 5500 hr
vere only slightly different from those of the as-annealed material

(Figs. 24 and 25, pp. 38 and 41) and (2) the strain at fracture in tensile
tests at 25°C ﬁas not reduced by irradiation. The most disturbing obser-
vation is the infergranular cracking near the surface of specimens that
were removed from the reactor.. Our measurements?? of the lattice diffusion
of titanium in the modified alloy indicate that the gradients in these
samples should extend to a depth of ouly about 0.15 mil (based on a
lattice diffusion coefficient of 1 X 10”1’ cm?/sec and 5500 hr exposure

at 650°C)..waever, titanium can diffuse more rapidly along the graiu
boundaries and we can approximate‘this'depth-of removal by_the Fisher
model.?l Assuming that the grain boundary diffusion rate is 10% times
that for the lattice,2? significant depletion of the titanium should
ocecur along the grain boundaries to depths of about 4 mils. This is in
reasonable agreement with the depth of the surface cracks observed in fhe
surveillance specimens (Figs. 34 and 40, pp. 50 and 56). However, the
control specimens (Figs. 35 and 41, pp. 51 and 57) were exposed to static
salt but did exhibit edge cracking when tested. It is possible that
corrosion in the static vessel proceeds more slowly than in the flowing
reactor circuit or that the grain boundary cracking may be a result of

the loss or ingress of some element besides titanium.

with a thermal fluehce-of 1.3 x 1019 neutrons/cm2 The compatibility
of the material with the cell environment of nltrogen plus 2 to 5% O,
seems excellent with no ev1dence of nitriding and only superficial

oxidation. Mechanlcal property tests show that the fracture strain at

25°C and above 500°C was reduced markedly by irradiation. Creep-

rupture tests at 650°C_show a reduction in rupture life and ductility..

. A comparison with results from the first group of surveillance specimens

exposed to the core envirenment to a fluence of 1.3 x 10?° neutrons/em?
indlcated that the mechanlcal properties deteriorated only sllghtly
with 1ncreasing fluence. o
