.~ This report is a compilation of the results of reactor physics %ﬁg
calculations to date for the currently proposed MSRE core design. ar
The core was assumed to consist of a homogeneous mixture of fuel |
galt and graphite, with 22.5 per cent of the core volume occupied

by fuel; the salt composition was the currently proposed mixture

of 70 mole per cent LiF, 23 mole per cent BeF ‘5 mole per cent
ZrF), ‘1 mole per cent ThF),, and UF) as required for criticality.

The calculated critical mole per cent, assuming 93.5 per cent U-235,

is 0.2 mole per cent UF); the associated inventory of U-235 in the
circulating system is U4 kilogr 8. Mean core thermal flux is
estimated to be 2.9 x 1013 n/em® sec with an associated mean power
density of 3. 9 watts/cm3 for 10 megawatts total reactor power.

~ MSRE PRELIMINARY FHYSICS REPORT .

Introduction

The purposes of this report are to assemble ‘bhe results of the reactor
physics calculaetions which have been done concerning the currently proposed |
MSRE core design, and to point out the areas in which further work needs to -

. be done. Estimates have been made of the reactor characteristics using the

core model and calculation methods discussed in Reactor Model and Calculation

Methods; these results are presented in Teble 1 and discussed in Results.
Consideration is given to the problems of fission product buildup, fuel salt

- and Xe~135 retention by the core graphite, and distortion of the core graphite
under irradistion in Long~term Reactor Behavior. It should be emphasized that
in some cases these resulte depend upon very scanty experimental data buttressed

by many assumptions end thet much more work remains to 'be done in this partice~
u.’l.ar area. o

'Reactor Model and Calculation Methods |

For the criticality calculations the rea.ctor was assumed to be a bare

right eirculer cylinder 27.7 inches in radius and 63 inches high; e radiel ex~

trapolation distance of 1 inch was added to simlate the effect of the fuel

- anmilus and -INOR-8 vessel, and an exiel extrepoletion distance of 3.5 inches
. was edded to both ends to similate the fuel selt contained in upper and lower
 heads of the s el. The IBM-TO% multigroup one-dimensionsl diffusion theory

program GNU-II ‘was used for the calculetions with the 31L-group cross section
library prepared for use in the thorium reactor evaluation progrem.“ The core

- was assumed to be a homogeneous mixture of T7.5 volume per cent graphite (density
1,90 gmn/cm®) and 22,5 volume per cent fuel selt, using the currently proposed -
‘mixture® of 70 mole per cent LiF (99.997% Ii7), 23 mole per cent BeFa, 5 mole

per cent ZrF4, ‘1 mole per cent ThF4 end ~ 1 mole per cent UFyg. (as required for
criticality) The external circuleting system volume was assumed to be Lo ﬂ;

which gave a ratio of total circulating system fuel volume to core fuel voltnne
. of 3.0.. The temperature and concentration coefficients of reactivity were esti-

mated from the output of the crit:l.cality search section o:r the GNU progrem, as :

B prev:lously described. _

Two-dimensional t O=group flux calcula.tions vere done using the IBM-7090

 program Equipoise-II( to obtain estimates of the power generated in the upper
- and lower heads of the vessel and in the fuel annulus surrounding the core.

This program was elso used in the estimation of the effects of graphite dis-

- tortion on reactivity (see Long~term Reactor Beha.vior) Two-group constants -
were obtained from the autpu‘b of the GNU program. o S

 Results : - -

 The principal results are tebuleted in Teble 1.

Long«-Texrm Rea.ctor Behavior

In the currently proposed MSRE core the fuel salt is in contact with the
graphite moderstor and some penetration of the graphite by gaseous fission
products and by fuel salt will certainly occur., It 1s, however, extremely
unclear at this time vhat the amounts of these penetrations will be, since
there is no experimental date con¢cerning the behavior of fuel salt, and
fission products in contact with the proposed MSRE grephite. In addition,
geseous fission products will be stripped from the salt in the pump bowl by
& belium sparge vhen the resctor is operating at power. Any calculation degle
ing with the effects of fuel and fission product retentlon ls therefore based
on assumptions of unknown reliebility and should be regerded only &s an estie-
mate of possible behavior. Using a particular set of assumptions concerning
fuel selt and fission produet behavior, efficiency of stripping in the pump
bowl and graphite properties, Spiewak6 has celculeted an equilibrium Xe-135
poison fraction (ratio of Xe-135 atoms destroyed by neutron ebsorption to
fissions) of .0L84; this represents & reactivity change (6k/k) of 1.3% and
thie velue is quoted in Table 1, If all the fuel and Xe=135 were fixed in
the core, the associated reactivity would be 4%; there is & relatively wide
range of values which may result from epparently equally reasonsble assumptions.

Under long=term irradistion it is known that graphite will change its
dimensions. Since no irradlation experiments have been done with the proposed
MBRE graphite, the situstion with regard to long-term reactivity chenges is T
unelear. Using the results of caleulations of graphite distortion by Kinyon,
it is estimated that the combined effects of graphite distortion and fission
producet buildup will amount to & resctivity decrease of 3.8% in one full power-
year's operation. These calculations were based on & single short-term experi-
ment on & similar grade of grephite, not exposed to fuel salt; this result
should therefore be regarded as only an estimate of possible behavior.
