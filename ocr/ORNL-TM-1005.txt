EFFECT OF EIEVATED TEMPERATURE IRRADIATION ON THE
STRENGTH AND DUCTILITY OF THE NICKEL-BASE ALLOY, HASTELLOY N

W. R. Martin and J. R. Weilr
ABSTRACT

The tensile properties of Hastelloy N have been deter-
mined after irradiation at 700°C to a dose level of
7 x 1020 nvt (E > 1 Mév) and 9 x 1029 nvt (thermal). The
strength and ductility of the material were determined as
functions of deformation temperature for the range of 20 to
900°C. These properties were also examined as functions of
strain rate within the limits of 0.002 and 0.2 in./min for
deformation temperatures of 500, 600, 700, and 800°C.

, The stress-strain relationship is not affected by irra-
diation at 700°C. Ductility, as measured by the true uniform
and fracture strains, is reduced for deformation temperatures
of 500°C and above. The loss in ductility results in a reduc-
tion in the true tensile strength. This loss is more signif-
icant at test conditions resulting in intergranular failure,

such as low strain rates at elevated temperature. Postirradi- E)Ij

improved ductility. These data are compatible with the GLMNWQC

experiments suggesting helium generation from the (n,a)
reaction of boron as the cause of low ductility.

The low ductility of irradiated alloys in general 1is
described in terms of the present knowledge of intergranular
fracture. Means of improving the ductility are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Nickel-base alloys and stainless steels are used extensively in
nuclear reactors because of their resistance to corrosion, suitable
mechanical properties, and fabricability. Because of the lack of con-
sistent data on the strength and ductility of material irradiated at
well-defined conditions, the design of reactor components is usually based
on the mechanical properties of unirradiated material with appropriate
safety factors. Investigations of the mechanical properties of irradiated

material are needed to establish confidence in that element of safety.

Postirradiation tensile tests are considered useful tools for evalua-~

1 reduction in ductility for

tion of irradiation damage. We have shown
irradiated stainless steel by using the tensile test technique. Hastelloy N
has been irradiated at 700°C and the pre- and postirradiation tensile data
compared to determine the irradiation effect. Tensile test temperature and
strain rate are two variables markedly affecting the apparent strength

and ductility of an alloy and both are considered in this investigation.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES AND TEST CONDITIONS

To evaluate the type and extent of irradiation damage at elevated
temperature, Hastelloy N was irradiated at 700°C in the B-8 lattice posi-
tion of the Oak Ridge Research Reactor (ORR) to an exposure of about
7 X 10%° nvt (E > 1 Mev) and 9 x 1029 nvt (thermal). The composition of
Hastelloy N is as follows:

in an Instron tensile machine. The mechanical property data generated

from these tests are then compared to data generated from unirradiated

INFLUENCE OF DEFORMATION TEMPERATURE

The data for Hastelloy N strained at a rate of 2% per min are given
in Table 1 for irradiated and unirradiated material as a function of
postirradiation deformation temperature. The 0.2% offset yield stress
was not significantly affected by irradiation. The deviations in the
true tensile strength are believed to be insignificant except for defor-
mation temperatures of 500°C and above. The true tensile stress was
reduced about 50% at 700°C. Ductility of the alloy, as measured by the
true uniform and fracture strains, e, was affected at deformation tempera-

tures of 500°C and above. The true fracture strain of the unirradiated

material exhibits a minimum at elevated temperature. This minimum is
typical for the alloy and is reflected in the reduction of area and total
elongation measurements normally reported. However, no ductility minimum
1s observed for the irradiated alloy, and the ductility as measured by
either uniform or fracture strain decreases with increasing deformation

temperature.

STRAIN RATE SENSITIVITY AT ELEVATED TEMPERATURE

The strength and ductility of the irradiated and unirradiated alloy
are given in Table 2 as functions of strain rate for deformation tempera-
tures of 500°C and above. The ductility decreases with decreasing strain
rate. The ductility of the irradiated material is particularly low at
800°C and 0.2% per min strain rate. The effects of irradiation on the
uniform and fracture strains, shown in Fig. 3., are approximately equiva-
lent in magnitude. However, the effect on uniform strains appears to
saturate, whereas the magnitude of the irradiation effect on the fracture
strains continues to increase with increasing deformation temperature.

POSTIRRADTATION ANNEALING

The effect of postirradiation heat treatment of the alloy at the
recommended solid solution temperature of 1175°C for 1 hr is shown in
Table 3. The elevated temperature ductility of the irradiated alloy is
not improved by the heat treatment, thereby indicating the thermal sta-
bility of the configuration causing the reduced ductility. Since the
heat treatment results in resolution of carbide precipitates, any influence
of irradiation on the precipitation of these carbides is not responsible

for the observed ductility reduction.

DISCUSSION

The results indicate that the effect of irradistion at elevated tem-

perature on the strength and ductility of Hastelloy N is qualitatively the

 
 

‘same as that reported for stainless steel.?’% The stress-strain relation-
ship at elevated temperature is not affected by irradiation at 600°C and

above. This is in contrast to irradiation below 600°C, where the stress-

The defects introduced by fast neutrons annealed during irradiation at
the elevated temperatures. The reduction in tensile strength at elevated
temperatures is a result of the inability of the irradiated alloy to
strain plastically. The fracture at a reduced strain therefore decreases
the true tensile strength, and the magnitude of the reduction increases
as the test conditions are altered to increase the strain-hardening
coefficient (i.e., increased strain rates). If the alloy is irradiated
at elevated temperature, the reduction in ductility occurs only for

deformation at elevated temperatures. Metallographic examination by the

from transgranular to the intergranular mode of fracture. When the

These cracks propagate along the boundary rather than widen in the irradi-

reduced strain, as shown in Fig. 7. Therefore, it would appear that both

the nucleation and propagation of cracks are affected.

Thus, the influence of irradiation at elevated temperature is one
affecting only the fracture of grain boundaries. Intergranular fracture

is classified into two types:

1. wedge type that originate at triple points,
13

2. cavity type 1n which small cavities are nucleated along grain
boundaries.
The intergranular tensile test fractures observed for the irradiated and
unirradiated alloys have been of the wedge type. These type cracks are
formed on boundaries transverse, and on occasion obligue, to the direction
of the stress applied to the bulk specimen. Although many questions need
to be answered about intergranular wedge-type fracture, it is generally
believed’ that a prerequisite is grain boundary sliding. Localized
deformation along the boundaries results in stress concentrations that
nucleate fracture if not dissipated by boundary migration or recrystalliza-
tion. Any mechanism proposed for the reduced ductility of irradiated alloys
must be one that does not increase the effectiveness of the boundaries as
dislocation barriers. Grain boundary sliding could be affected by irradia-
tion either reducing the magnitude of boundary deformation that an
aggregate can accommodate before fracture or by increasing the rate of
boundary sliding. Measurement of grain boundary deformation, perhaps by
the Rachinger® method, needs to be determined as a function of stress for
irradiated and unirradiated alloys. Certainly, the reduced ductility

could be related to factors
Electron fractography is required to elucidate this area.

The elevated temperature embrittlement has been reported by Roberts
and Harries® to be related to thermal rather than fast neutrons. Slow
neutrons, apart from scattering, show four types of capture reactions:
1. emission of gamma radiation (n,y),

2. eJjection of an alpha particle (n,a),

3. eJjection of a proton (n,p), and

4, Tfission (n,f).

Of the four reactions, the (n,a) reactions appears the most likely to

cause the embrittlement. This reaction, producing helium localized at

the grain boundary, could affect the nucleation of cracks at the grain

boundary and, conceivably, crack propagation. The thermal stability of
the defect, as indicated by the postirradiation heat treatment data, is
compatible with the hypothesis of helium generation. The thermal stabil-
ity of this defect ig in sharp contrast with data by Ba.iley9 and others!®
that show that the low-temperature (< 500°C) damage caused by fast neutrons
can be annealed at 400 to 980°C. However, the concentration of the

species necessary for (n,a) reaction is in the parts per million range for
stainless steel and nickel-base alloys. Boron-10 and lithium-6 are two
such species, given by Barnes,11 that generate large specific volumes of
gas. If the boron is concentrated at the grain boundaries, the atomic
fraction of the helium produced can be large even with the average concen-
tration of 1°B in the 1- to 10-ppm range. Studies by other investigatorsl2
indicate boron segregation in the grain boundaries of austenitic alloys.

Studies'*»1° to examine the influence of boron content on the
properties of irradiated alloys show complex relationships between
boron content and ductility for the alloy deformed at elevated tempera-
ture. However, these studies are complicated by the fact that boron for

the concentrations investigated influences the strength and ductility of

the unirradiated alloy. The influence of boron on the solubility of
carbon, alteration of precipitate distribution, and grain size is well
documented.1%,16,17

Of course, the foregoing discussion is dependent on the embrittle-
ment being related to thermal neutrons and helium generation. The data
generated, to date, 1s indirect evidence. However, if the ductility is
a result of helium generation, the problem of embrittlement of irradiated
materials deformed at elevated temperature will have to be solved by
removing the species undergoing (n,a) reaction from the grain boundaries.
Several approaches are available:

1. The average concentration may be lowered by electron-beam
melting.

2. Distribute the boron within the grain as stable precipitates,
such as borides and combination precipitation of Fe,3(BC)g¢. Helium
atoms and/or bubbles may be trapped at the precipitate, thereby greatly
reducing the concentration of helium bubbles in the grain boundary.

3. Lower the concentration at the boundary by increasing the number
of boundaries on which the specie precipitates or segregates.

The characteristics of the damge caused by irradiation at elevated
temperature are as follows:

1. Yield stress and tensile strength are not affected.

2. Ductility of material is reduced.

3. The reduction in ductility is noted by large decreases in the
uniform and fracture strain and by small decreases in the true tensile
and fracture stresses.

4. The reduction in ductility is more significant at test conditions
resulting in intergranular failure, such as low strain rates at elevated
temperature.

5. Heat treatments that anneal the damage causing the low-temperature

irradiation effect do not improve the ductility at elevated temperature.
