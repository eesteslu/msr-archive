ABSTRACT

) The primary heat exchanger for the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment
“lv was completed in 1963. Preoperational tests with water revealed
. excessive tube vibrations and high fluid pressure drop on the shell
side of the exchanger. Modifications were made to correct these
deficiencies. From January 1965 through November 1967 the heat ex-
chenger has operated for about 14,000 hours in molten salt without
indications of leakage or change in performance.

INTRODUCTION

In October 1967, the Division of Reactor Development and Technology
of the AEC began a survey of heat exchangers in the primary circuits of
nuclear reactor facilities for which the Division has technical responsi-
bility.}s# The heat exchanger in the fuel circult of the Molten-Salt
Reactor Experiment (MSRE) was included in the survey, and this report is
intended to provide the information requested.

The heat exchanger was designed in 1961. Fabricastion was completed
early in 1963. Difficulties with excessive vibrations in heat exchangers
at other nuclear reactor facilities prompted a review of the design of the
unit that had been built for the MSRE. This review indicated that vibra-
tion could be & problem and that flow tests should be conducted with the
heat exchanger., Flow tests with water were performed on the exchanger
during the winter of 1963-1964. The tests revealed excessive vibration
of the tubes and excessive pressure drop through the shell side of the
heat exchanger., Its faults were corrected, and the modified component
was installed in the primary.loop of the reactor system, Fig. 1, in the
spring of 1964, From January 1965 through November 1967 the heat ex-
changer has been operated for approximately 14,000 hours with molten salt
at temperatures from 1000 to 1225°F without indications of leakage or

change in performance.

~ DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS OF PRIMARY HEAT EXCHANGER
The MSRE primary'heat:eXchanger.is used to transfer heat from the
fuel salt'to the'coolant'salt It was designed for low holdup of salts,

'31mplicity of construction, and moderately high performance. The space
_,limitations W1thin the containment and other considerations dictated a
3 fairly compact unit. 3 A U—tube configuration as shown in Fig. 2 best

satisfied the requirements and also minimized the thermal-expansion

'~problems in the heat exchanger.u-

1225°F to 1175°F. The coolant salt circulates through the tubes at &
rate of 850 gpm, entering at 1025°F and leaving at 1100°F. From the
heat transfer and drainability standpoints, it was better to pass the
fuel salt through the shell and the coolent salt through the tubes., The
shell side also presents less opportunity for retention of gas pockets
during fuel salt filling operations. | |

The design data are given in Table 1 and the design basis physical
properties of the fuel and coolant salts and container materiasl are
given in Tables 2 and 3. Stresses in the shell, tubes, and tube sheet
were evaluated for the design point conditions and reported in design
reports.4>5 Design of the heat exchanger was based on formulae and
correlations of Kiern,6 requiremeﬁts of the ASME Unfired Pressure Vessel
Code, Section VIII,”7 Interpretations of ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel
Codes,®»9,10,11 gng Stendards of Tubular Exchanger Manufacturers Associ-
ation,l® The exchanger was 6f a common design; applicable ASME and TEMA
standards did not require a vibration analysis and none was made.

The TEMA standards do require that means be provided to protect the
tube bundlie against impinging fluids at the entrance to the shell if the
velocity of the entering fluid exceeds 3 ft/sec. Since the fluid enters
the MSRE heat exchanger at 19.3 ft/sec, an impingement baffle was needed
to satisfy TEMA standards. This impingement baffle was omitted from the
design in order to keep the hold-up of fuel salt to a minimum.

Tube holes in cross baffles were drilled 1/32 in. larger in diemeter
than the outside diasmeter of the tubes as indicated by TEMA standards.
This large clearance contributed to a tube vibration problem that was
discovered during preoperational testing and is discussed in a later

section of this report.

. DESCRIPTION OF HEAT EXCHANGER

The heat exchanger is a conventional shell and U-tube exchanger with
a cross-baffled tube bundle. Tt is of all-welded construction and is
fabricated from Hastelloy-N throughout, except for the alloy used to
back-braze the tube sheet jolnts, The dished heads were cold-pressed by
the Paducah Plant of Union Carbide, the tube sheet was forged by Taylor
Forge Co., the tube-to-tube sheet joints were back-brazed by Wall
Colmonoy Co., and ‘the remainder of the fabrication was done in machine
shops of the Y-12 Plant of Union Carbide. All work was covered by ORNL
Specifications,13

The shell is ~ 17 in., OD and about 8-ft 3-in. long, including the
8-3/k—in. long coolant salt header and the ASME flanged and dished heads
at the ends. (See ORNL Drawings D-EE-A-L0869, -T2, -Thk.) The shell is
1/2-in, thick in the cylindrical portion and the heads. The fuel enters
at the U-bend end of the shell through a 5-in. Schedule-l40 pipe nozzle,
near the top of the dished head. Before modifications, the fuel salt
left through a 5-in. Schedule-40 pipe nozzle at the bottom of the shell
at the tube sheet end. (See ORNL Drawings D-EE-A-L08T3, -Tk.)

Six 25%-cut cross baffles of 1/4-in. plate, spaced at 12-in. inter-
vals, direct the fuel salt flow across the tube bundle (see ORNL Drawings
D-EE-A-L086L4, -65, -66). A barrier plate, similar to the baffle plates
but with no cutaway segment, is located 1-7/8 in. from the tube sheet to
provide a more-or- -less stagnant layer of fuel salt and reduce temperature
differences across the tube sheet The baffles and the barrier plate

~ are held in position by spacer rods, screwed and tackdwelded together,
‘to the tube sheet, and to each baffle.

A divider separates the entering and leaving coolant salt streams

© in the coolant header. It is fabricated of 1/2-in. plate and extends
',from the ‘tube sheet to the dished head. It is positioned by guide'strips
~on the shell wall and a groove in the edge fits ‘over & l/h—in. pointed,

horizontal. projection on the tube sheet This arrangement provides a

.hrﬂlabyrinth-type seal between the channels without stiffening the tube

sheet,

 
 

15

Before modificetions to the heat exchanger, there were 163 tubes,
1/2-in, OD by 0.042-in, wall thickness, affording an effective transfer
surface of ~ 254 rt2, See ORNL Drewing D-EE-40867. The tubes are ar-
ranged on & 0.775~in, equilateral triangular pitch, The tube holes
through the 1-1/2—in, thick tube sheet had trepanned grooves on both
sides of the sheet., See ORNL Drawing D-EE-A-L0865. . .

The grooves on the coolant salt side were to permit the tube-to-tube
sheet welds to be made between the tube and & lip of about equal wall
thickness in the tube sheet (see Figure 3). The tubes were expanded at
the tip end into the holes before welding., After welding, the tube
openings were reamed to the inslde diameter of the tubes. The trepanned
grooves on the fuel-salt side were to permit back-brazing of the joints.
The back-brazing operation was performed in a furnace with a hydrogen
atmosphere using a ring of gold-nickel brazing alloy.

The heat exchanger is installed horizontally, pitching toward the
fuel-salt outlet at a slope of about 3°. Each U-tube is oriented so
that the coolant salt will also drain. The unit weighs about 2060 1bs
when empty and 3500 lbs when filled with fuel and coolant salts. The.
fuel-salt holdup 1s ~ 6.1 £t>, and the coolant-salt holdup is about
3.7 £t°.

PRE-OPERATIONAL TESTING AND MODIFICATIONS

Difficulties with excessive vibrations in heat exchangers at the
Enrico Fermi Atomic Power Plant and the Hallam Nuclear Power Facility
prompted a review of the MSRE heat exchanger design in the fall of 1963.
This review, together with some exploratory tests of a single tube mockup,
indicated that fluid induced vibrations could be a problem, and that flow
tests should be conducted on the heat exchanger.

Water was the fluid used for these tests for the following reasons:

1. It is convenient to use and readily available at the necessary
flow rates. - '

2. The Strouhsl Number ((ff§%§:§9§l£§§§§;?)) which is the charac-
teristic number used to correlate fluid-induced vibrations from vortex

shedding, is independent of fluid properties such as density and viscosity.

3. Fluid pressure drop measurements were also taken during the
tests and are readily convertible from a water system to a molten salt
systenm, |

Accordingly, an outdoor test installation was built as shown sche-
matically in Figure 4. Water was supplied from a large capacity water
main, A once-through system was used and the water discharged into a
drainage ditch; Before installing the MSRE heat exchanger, the line
‘without the strainer installed was flushed out for about 20 minutes at a
flow rate of 2800 gpm. The strainer was then inserted and the system was
flushed again for about 1 hour at 2600 gpm. Sediment collected by the
stralner consisted of several small pieces of paper gasket material, and
a very small piece of lead. The system was now considered clean and the
heat exchanger was installed. During each successive run, the system
was flushed for a few minutes before water was run through the heat ex-
changer. , _

Hydraulic testing of the heat exchanger can be conveniently divided
into 4 chronological phases as follows: |

1. Initial test of the heat exchanger as built.

2. Testing the heat exchanger as designed, but with the Hastelloy-N
shell replaced by a speclal stainless steel shell featuring observation
windows.

3. Testing the heat exchanger as modified, and with the special
stainless steel shell, :

i, Final testing of the heat exchanger as modified, and with the
Hastelloy-N shell.

Initial Test of Heat Exchanger, As-Built

The heat exchanger, as built, was installed in the water test facility
and tested in December of 1963. Results of this test are as follows:

1. The most dramatic results were audible. At flow rates of 800
to 900 gpm (~ 2/3 design flow) through the shell slde, an intermittent
rattling noise came from the heat exchanger. This noise is hard to de-
scribe but it impressed us as the kind of noise one might hear if tubes
were rattling in the baffle plates. As the flow rate was increased, the

fraction of time that the rattling noise was heard also increased and it
seemed to get louder. At about 1100 gpm the noise was continuous. The
rattling continued to’gef louder to the meximum flow rate'ﬁested, 1300 gpm.
The character of the noise heard differed 1ittle whether the tubes were
empty or full of water. . | _

Measurements were taken with an International Research and Development
Corporation, Model 600B, external pick-up vibrometer at intervals of
200 gpm from 500 to 1300 gpm. The results were hard to interpret.
Generally at flow rates abbve 900 gpm, more instrument activity in the
range of 450-3500 cpm was observed, however, no discrete and continuous
frequencies could be detected. The audible'ratfling noise was the best
indication we had that the tubes were vibfating. To assure ourselves
that the noise was not due to cavitation, we increased back pressure to
55 psig at 1000 gpm. There was no obvious change in the character of
the noise. The conclusion from these tests was that the tubes were
probably vibrating excessively. '

2. 'The overall pressure drop through the tube side and the shell
side of the heat exchanger was measured. The pressure drop through the
tube side was almost exactly the estimated value. The pressure drop
through the shell side was about twice the estimated value.

From these tests, it appeared that we had two serious problems,
tube vibrations and excessive pressure drop on the shell side. To in-
vestigate these problems more thoroughly, we cut off the Hastelloy-N
shell and replaced it with a special stainless steel shell incorporating
16 windows. The vibrations could then be viewed directly, also the win-
dows could be fitted with pressure taps to determine the pressure drop
distribution. This special shell is shown in Figure 5. N

When the Hastelloy-N shell was removed, we noted that 2 tubes in
the outermost row of 4 tubes (longest tubes) had vibrated against a
seam weld in the shell wearing a notch ~ 0.0025-in. deep in the wall of
Tube A and ~ 0.005-in.7deep in Tube B. A photograph of this is shown in
Figure 6. No worn places could be found on the tubes where they pene-
trated the baffle plates.

Test of Heat Exchangérf As-Designed but with’Special Shell

The heat exchanger, as designed but with its new shell, was then
tested with flow rates up to 1200 gpm. Results of this test are as
follows:

1. The "U" bends vibrated quite severely with estimated frequencies
from 5 to 10 cps, and with peak-to-pesk amplitudes as high as 1/k in,

2. In the bulk of the heat exchanger, some of the tubes that pene-
trate every baffle plate vibrated, and most of the tubes that penetrate
every other baffle plate vibrated. The sections of tubes between baffles
vibrated with much less smplitude than did the U bends.'

3. In the bulk of the heat exchanger the tubes in the interior of
the bundle seemed to vibrate less severely than those near the edge.

This may be because most of the tubes in the interior of the bundle pene-
trate every baffle plate. Tt may also have been an illusion because the
tubes on the interior of the bundle were difficult to see.

L, TIn the vicinity of the tube sheet where the tubes are brazed
in, there was no visible vibration.

5. The character of the rattling noise in this test was the same

‘as in the previous test and could definitely be correlated with tube

vibration,

6. The excessive fluid pressure drop through the shell side was
determined to be where the tubes passed very close to the inlet and out-
let pipes and tended to choke them off.

Based ‘on the above observations, the following corrective actions
were taken- | o f' ' R

1. The 4 outermost U tubes and. h associated tie bars were removed.

| Plugs were welded into the 8 resulting tube stub ends, and into all the
, resulting holes. in the baffle plates.l (See ORNL Drawing M -10329-RE-003E2. )
,:The intent of this change was two-fold First, 1t helped alleviate the
'tube vibration problem because “two of these tubes had the worn spots
shown in Figure 6. Second it helped lower the shell side pressure drop
' because these tubes and tie bars contributed greatly to choking the

shell side inlet and outlet

 
 

22

2, Bars were laced between the tubes on the downstream side and
adjacent to each baffle plate as shown in ORNL Drawing M-10329-RE-003E2.
Note that the lecing is in two directions. It was belleved that lacing
in one direction would not be adequate. It also seemed that lacing in
the third direction would be redundant because the holes in the baffle
plates could serve as contact points. The lacing bars were sized so that
they f£it snugly between the tubes, and were tack-welded to the baffle
plates. Other methods of tightening the tubes in this structure were
-considered, such as expanding the tubes into the baffles and bending,
twisting or in some other way deforming the bundle. All were discarded
however, in favor of this lacing method.

3. A similar lacing was built across the middle of the U bends as
shown in ORNL Drawing M-10329-RE-Q02EL. In this structure the lacing
bars are threaded through the tubes in two directions and welded to the
outer band, This makes a1l the tubes in the U bend behave as a single
member. The structure is supported by the tubes. This arrangement
probably affects only a small increase in fluid pressure drop through the
region of the U bends.

i, The special stainless steel heat exchanger shell was lengthened
1.0 in, and an impingement baffle was installed in the inlet as shown in
ORNL Drawing M-2079L-RE-030El for the Hastelloy-N shell.

5. The 5-in. outlet pipe was replaced by a 7 x 5 in. conical re-
ducer as shown in ORNL Drawing M-20T94-RE-030El to reduce the exit
pressure drop.

6. An accelerometer {Endevco Corp., Model 2220) was mounted on one
of the centermost tubes in the U bend just below the midplane of the heat

exchanger,
Testing Heat Exchanger, As-Modified but with Specisl Shell

With the above modifications incorporated into the tube bundle and
the special, the heat exchanger was again installed into the test facility.
Results of this series of tests with flow rates up to 1700 gpm are as
follows:’

1. Tube vibrations were reduced to a negligible amount. No tube

vibrations were visible anywhere in the tube bundle. No noise attributable

to tube vibrations (metal-to-metal contacting) could be detected. The
accelerometer detected a very high frequency vibration of 2000-3000 cps.
The amplitude was not accurately measurable but appeared to be less than
0.001 in, ,

2. The overall fluid pressure drop on the shell side was reduced
and slmost exactly equaled the predicted value.

At this point, the vibrational and pressure drop problems were con-
sidered adequately solved.

Final Test of Modified Heat Exchanger

All modifications were now incorporated into the Hastelloy-N shell,
and the heat exchanger was reassembled., The unit was installed in the
test facllity and tested to flow rates as high as 1650 gpm. The results
of this test were identical to those of the previous test, that is,
fluid induced tube vibrations were reduced to a negligible level and the
shell side pressure drop was adequately low, Figure T shows the final
overall pressure drop through the tube side and shell side. The tube
side pressure drop is based on date taken during the initial test and
the shell side pressure drop was measured during the final test.

OPERATIONAL HISTORY

Installation of the ‘heat exchanger in the reactor was completed

~ late in the spring of l96h Fuel and coolant salt were first circulated

through the reactor systems-in"January 1965. The reaetor reached criti-

~ cality on June 1, 1965, and low levels (o - 50 kw) of nuclear power were
'first generated in December 1965 _(See_Figure 8.) Full-power (7-1/2 Mw)

operations began in April. 1966 and are'continuing at the present time.
During the past three years the heat exchanger has operated for more

'than lh 000 hours with molten salt without any indication of a leak be-

tween fuel. and coolant salts. or into the reactor cell ‘There has been
no evidence either of ges filming of the heat exchanger tubes or of a de-
crease in performance by a buildup of scale. Accumulated operating data

are given in Table L,

®Total to December 5, 1967

Soon after the operating power of the MSRE was raised to a signifi-
cant level, the heat-transfer capability of the main heat exchanger and
the coolant radiator was found to be less than predicted and; in fact,
limited the attainable heat removal to about 7-1/2 Mw.'¢ The nominal
power chosen for the design of the MSRE was 10 Mw., The overall heat-
transfer coefficient of the primary heat exchanger was below the pre-
dicted value, resulting in somewhat larger fuel to coolant temperature
differences than had been planned. The performance of the main heat ex-
changer was explained by recent measurements of the fuel salt thermal
conductivity which indicated a value of 0.83 E?-;uﬁ rather than
2.75 ﬁ;:§$%337 which was used in the calculations.

The fuel salt that circulates through the heat exchanger in the MSRE
is highly radioactive. Noble metal fission pro&ucts are reduced to metals
in the salt, and some of them deposit on surfaces in the heat exchanger

so it too becomes highly radicactive, The heat exchanger is of all-welded

L

ar

construction and is covered by heater-insulation boxes that are difficult
to remove and reinstall remotely. Any meaningful nondestructive inspec-

tion of the interior is impossible and of the exterior is extremely diffi-
cult, No inspection is planned, at least until the experiment is completed |

~or the heat'exchanger must be removed because it develops a leak, Leakage

through failure of one or more tubes by vibration should be detectable by
& smell incfease in salt inventory in the fuel system and decrease in
salt inventory in the coolant system. The reactor is designed on the
basis that such a leak or a leak from the fuel system into the coolant
system might someday occur. The fuel and coolant salt systems are tested

separately at pressures above the normal operating pressures at intervals

of 6 to 12 months.1® No leskage has ever been indicated.

- Because the heat exchanger operates at temperatures above 1000°F in
a highly radioactive envircnment, no equipment is installed to monitor
vibrations. However; we believe it unlikely that the vibration has in-
creased since the final preoperational hydraulic flow tests., For vibra-

‘tion to reoccur, the rigidity of the tube bundle would have to be reduced.

This could happen if the clearances between the tubes and lacing were
increased by corrosion of the salt container material, however, this is
unlikely. Chemical analysis of the fuel and coolant salt show that
general corrosion of Hastelloy-N in the system has been practically nil
(~ 0.1 mi1),16 |

Vibration could also reoccur if the flow rate of the fuel salt
entering the shell side of the heat exchanger were substantislly increased.
This is aiso'unlikely.as the,fnel and coolant salt flow rates are fixed
and cannot ‘be varied uniess fne impellers'of the pumpslare modified, The

original pumps are still in operation and there are no plans to replace
these pu.mps before the MSRE :I.s terminated in 1969

- {comct.ﬁsn:ons

1. Testing the. MSRE heat exchanger with water indicated fluid

flow induced ‘tube vibrations and an excessive pressure drop on the shell

side The best indication we had of tube vibrations was a rattling

noise emanating from the heat exchanger.

 
 

 

 

28

2. An extension of the above conclusion is that water is an ade-
quate fluid to test molten salt heat exchangers for fluid-induced vibra-
- tionms. ”

3. The fluid-induced tube vibrations were eliminated by lacing
bars between the tubes at the baffle plates, by building a structure of
bars dround the U bend in the tubé bundle, and by imstalling an impinge-
ment baffle at the Inlet to the shell.

4, The excessive fluid pressure drop through the shell side was
found to result from choking of the inlet and outlet pipes by the outer-
most row of tubes and tie bars. The pressure drop was reduced to an
acceptable value by removing these tubes and tie bars and increasing the
diameter of the outlet pipe. '

5. After more than 14,000 hours of operation with salt in the sys-

tem to date, the heat exchanger has shown no indication of leakage or
change in operating performance. '

6. We find no reasons why the primary heat exchanger should fail
from vibration-induced damage before the planned termination of the
MSRE in 1969. |
