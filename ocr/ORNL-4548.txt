'Introduction

The objective of the Molten-Salt Reactor Program is

the development of nuclear reactors which use fluid

fuel§ that are solutions of fissile and fertile materials in
suitable carrier salts. The program is an outgrowth of

the effort begun over 20 years ago in the Aircraft

Nuclear Propulsion program to make a molten-salt
reactor power plant for aircraft. A molten-salt reactor —
the Aircraft Reactor Experiment — was operated at
ORNL in 1954 as part of the ANP program. ‘

Our major goal now is to achieve a thermal breeder

reactor that will produce power at low cost while -

simultaneously conserving and extending the nation’s
fuel resources. Fuel for this type of reactor would be
233UF, dissolved in a salt that is a mixture of LiF and
BeF,, but it could be started up with 225U or
plutonium. The fertile material would be ThF, dis-
solved in the same salt or in a separate blanket salt of
similar composition. The technology being developed
for the breeder is also applicable to high-performance
converter reactors.

A major program activity until recently was the
operation of the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment. This

~ reactor was built to test the types of fuels and materials

that would be used in thermal breeder and converter
reactors and to provide experience with the operation
and maintenance of a molten-salt reactor. The MSRE
operated at 1200°F and at atmospheric pressure and
produced about 8 Mw of heat. The initial fuel con-

tained 0.9 mole % UF,, 5 mole % ZrF,, 29 mole %

BeF,, and 65 mole % "LiF, a mixture which has a
melting point of 840°F. The uranium was about 33%
235U

The fuel cxrculated through a reactor vessel and an
external pump and heat exchange system. All this
equipment was constructed of Hastelloy ‘N, a nickel-
molybdenum-iron-chromium alloy with exceptional re-
sistance to corrosion by molten fluorides and with high
strength at high temperature. The reactor core con-
tained an assembly of graphite moderator bars that
were in direct contact with the fuel. The fuel salt does

not wet graphite and therefore did not enter the pores.

Heat produced in the reactor was transferred to a
coolant salt in the primary heat exchanger, and the

coolant salt was pumped through a radiator to d1ss1pate
the heat to the atmosphere.

Design of the MSRE started in the summer of 1960,
and fabrication of equipment began early in 1962. The
reactor was taken critical on June 1, 1965, operation at

- low power began in January 1966, and full power was

reached in May 1966. Sustained power operation was
begun in December, when the MSRE was operated at
full power for 30 days without interruption.

In September 1967, a run was begun which continued
for six months, until terminated on schedule in March
1968. Power operation during this run had to be

‘interrupted once when the reactor was taken to zero

power to repair an electrical short in the sampler-
enricher. - '

Completion of this six-month run brought to a close
the first phase of MSRE operation, in which the
objective was to demonstrate on a small scale the
attractive features and technical feasibility of these
systems for civilian power reactors. We believe this

_objective has been achieved and that the MSRE has

shown that molten-fluoride reactors can be operated at
temperatures above 1200°F without corrosive attack on
either the metal or graphite parts of the system, that
the fuel is completely stable, that reactor equipment
can operate satisfactorily "at these conditions, that
xenon can be removed rapidly from molten salts, and
that, when necessary, the radioactive eqmpment can be
repaired or replaced.

The second phase of MSRE operation began in

August 1968, when a small facility in the MSRE

building was used to remove the original uranium
charge from the fuel salt by treatment with gaseous F,.

- In six days of fluorination, 219 kg of uranium was

removed from the molten salt and loaded onto ab-

- sorbers filled with sodium fluoride pellets. The decon-

Xi

tamination and recovery of the uranium were very
good.

While the fuel was being processed, a charge of 233U
was added to the original carrier salt, and in October
1968 the MSRE became the world’s first reactor to
operate on 233U. The nuclear characteristics of the

 
 

 

- xii

MSRE with the 233U were close to the predictions,
and, as expected, the reactor was quite stable.

In September 1969 small amounts of PuF, were
added to the fuel to obtain some experience with
plutonium in a molten-salt reactor. The MSRE was shut
down permanently December 12, 1969, so that the

funds supporting its operation could be used elsewhere

in the research and development program.
Most - of the Molten-Salt Reactor Program is now

being devoted to future moltensalt reactors. Con-
ceptual design studies are being made of breeder

reactors, and the program includes work on materials,
on the chemistry of fuel and coolant salts, on proc-
essing methods, and on components and systems
development. | _ ,
Until two years ago most of our work on breeder
reactors was aimed specifically at two-fluid systems in
which graphite tubes would be used to separate
uranium-bearing fuel salts from thorium-bearing fertile
salts. We think attractive reactors of this type -can be
developed, but several years of experience with a
prototype reactor would be required to prove that

graphite can serve as piping while exposed to high

fast-neutron irradiations. As a consequence, a one-fluid
breeder was a longsought goal.

In late 1967 two developments established the feasi-
bility of a one-fluid breeder. The first was demonstra-

tion of the chemical steps in a process which uses liquid -

bismuth to extract protactinium and uranium selec-
tively from a salt that also contains thorium. The
second was the recognition that a fertile blanket can be
obtained with a salt that contains uranium and thorium

‘by reducing the graphite-to-fuel ratio in the outer part

of the core. Our studies show that a onefluid,
two-region breeder can be built that has fuel utilization
characteristics approaching those of our two-fluid de-
signs and probably better economics. Since the graphite
serves only as moderator, the one-fluid reactor is more
nearly a scaleup of the MSRE. '
These features caused us to change the emphasis of

our breeder program from the two-fluid to the one-fluid -

_ breeder. Most of our design and development effort is

now directed to the one-fluid system.

Summary

PART 1. MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR
EXPERIMENT

1. MSRE Operations

The power operation of the reactor that was in
progress at the beginning of this report period was
continued through October 1969. After a three-week
shutdown, primarily to collect data on the deposition

of fission products on metal surfaces in the system, .

operation was resumed for a final run at power. Nuclear
operation of the MSRE was terminated on December
12, 1969. Although plugging in the off-gas system
continued to be an annoyance, no major equipment
difficulties were encountered during the reactor opera-
tion. '

. Experiments to study xenon behavwr in the reactor
system were concluded early in the report period.
Significant effects of circulating void fraction and cover
gas solubility on xenon poisoning are still being
evaluated. After completion of the xenon studies, the
reactor was operated at high power for a month to
facilitate the fission product deposition studies. This
continued operation at power required the addition of
more fissile material to the fuel. Six capsules of
plutonium, as PuF,, were added through the sampler-
enricher, demonstrating the suitability of plutomum as
an MSR makeup fuel. Enrichments were also made with
233U _
The remote gamma-ray spectrometer was used exten-
sively, with the reactor operating and during shut-
downs, to study fission product behavior. The on-power
studies provided additional information on nuclides
with relatively short half-lives. Measurements were
made on primary-system components, the reactor off-
gas line, and samples exposed in the pump bowl.
Extensive use was also made of the fuel sampler during
the last two runs, both to expose materials in the pump
bowl and to remove salt and cover gas samples. Subjects
of particular interest were the effect of the oxidation-
reduction state of the salt on fission product behavior
and salt properties and fission product transport to the
off-gas system.

xiii

Data were collected in the final power run in an effort
to establish a tritium balance for the MSRE. Results
indicated that 60 to 70% of the tritium produced in the
fuel loop goes out through the fuel off-gas system.
Other special measurements were made to improve the
heat-balance power calibration of the system.

After the final reactor shutdown, a leak developed in
the drain-line piping which' released a small amount of
activity into the secondary containment. The leak was
stopped by freezing salt in the drain tank freeze valves;
then the secondary containment was cleared by venting
the activity (mostly xenon and krypton) through filters
to the stack. With the fuel salt secured, the specimen
array was removed from the core, and the reactor
system was shut down completely.

Detailed analysis of the reactor operation is continu-
ing, and plans are being formulated for a final examina-
tion of the system.

2. Reactor Analysis

Reactor physics studies were continued, relating to
the effects of revisions in nuclear data on the calcula-
tion and interpretation of MSRE nuclear performance
characteristics. This work was extended to include a
comparison of results of using various computing
techniques to perform the basic neutronics calculations.
The study focused on the sensitivity of calculated
multiplication factors and spectrum-averaged capture-
to-absotption ratios for fissile materials to assumptions
in the neutronics model and the computer programs
used, Significant differences occurred in the calculated
multiplication factors, which appeared to arise mainly

from differences in calculated transport cross sections

and their associated effects on MSRE neutron leakage.
The capture-to-absorption ratios, however, were found
to be much less sensitive to these effects and to depend
mainly on the ‘underlying cross-section hbrarres for the
fissile materials.

An examination was also made .of the effects of
revisions in nuclear .data on the interpretation of
reactivity trends during the 225U operating history. All
reactivity balance data logged at very low power over
this period were modified to reflect the nuclear data

 
 

~ revisions . and to include certain carrections in .inter-

Xiv

pretation of the absolute magnitudes of several reac-

tivity effects. The net result of all changes left the
maximum variation in residual reactivity (reactivity not
explicitly accounted for in the calculation) quite small
(<0.1% &8k/k) during the entire operation with 23U,
and within the region of validity of the reactivity
balance model.

3. Component Development

The freeze flange thermal cycle test was discontinued
after 540 cycles. An inspection was made after cycle

470 which showed some changes in the cracklike
pattern at the alignment stub in the main flange.
However, as in all previous inspections, there were no
indications in locations that would cause concern. The
effects of flange cleaning procedures on the dye-
penetrant indications are being examined. '

The mark 2 fuel pump has now operated 12,744 hr
with molten salt. A new filter was installed in the
off-gas line. Small salt particles are continuing to collect
on the filter.

Comparisons were made between the xenon poisoning
observed in the MSRE and that predicted by a
mathematical model developed in 1967 which ignored
any effects of cover gas solubility. The model fits the
observed behavior with argon cover gas much more
closely than that with helium. The divergence with
helium at low circulating void fractions is tentatively
ascribed to effects of helium solubility in the salt.

4. Instruments and Centrols_

Most of the reactor instrumentation performed
normally during the final periods of operation. How-
ever, two unscheduled powef reductions were caused by
dirty relay contacts in the load-scram circuits. Some
changes were made in parts of the reactor containment
system to provide prete_ction_for the tritium sampling

- operations. The entire instrument system, including the
. on-line digital computer, was placed in standby opera-
“tion after the final reactor shutdown.

PART 2. MSBR DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT .
5. Design |
The major effort of the design group during the past

- period was the preparation of a comprehensive report

on the single-fluid MSBR reference design. A ﬁrst draft
was circulated for comment.

The only significant change made in the MSBR
reference design was the addition of a 2500-ft> storage
tank for the fuel salt. This tank would be used in the
event that repairs are needed on the primary drain tank.
The storage tank is located in the chemical processing
cell and has a 1-Mw(th) heat removal system very
similar to that used in the MSRE drain tank.

Partialdoad operation and startup and shutdown
procedures for the reference MSBR were given prelim-

inary study, and it was concluded that these special
conditions would not add undue operating complexity

ot an unreasonable amount of equipment. Starting from

the cold condition involves use of the cell electric
heaters and circulation of helium inside the salt loops to
preheat the system to about 1000°F prior to filling
them with salt from the drain tanks. The steam system
equipment is preheated by steam furnished from a
supercritical-pressure, 1000°F auxiliary boiler fired by
oil or gas. The steam generators are raised to essentially
operating temperature before the coolant salt circula-
tion is started. Generated steam is bypassed to the
turbine condenser through a desuperheater until about
8% reactor load level is reached and the main turbines
are brought up to speed. At about 20% load the control
mode is essentially that for full-load operation with the
reactor outlet temperature a function of the plant load.

On loss of turbine load, steam would be let down
through an extraction valve to the desuperheater and
thence to the main turbine condenser. A portion of the
steam would be used to continue operation of the
boiler feed-pump turbine to maintain water circulation

through the steam generators for removal of heat from

the secondary salt. Another portion of the steam, if
required, would be used to drive the standby power
turbine-generator set to allow continued operation of
the salt circulating pumps and as many as are needed of
the main condensing water supply and feedwater
pressure-booster pumps. In this hot standby condition,
the plant would require relatlvely little time to again
assume the system load.

For normal shutdown the generator load is reduced
until the system is essentially in the hot standby mode

described above. Feedwater is supplied to as many of

the steam generators as are required to remove the
reactor afterheat. After about ten days the fuel salt is
transferred to the primary drain tank and the steam
system is allowed to cool.

With completion- of the MSBR reference des1gn,
preliminary studies could be made of molten-salt
reactor types in which fuel conservation is given
reduced emphasis and higher priority is given to

o

simplifying the reactor plant and its operation. Al-
though the reactors would not have highest perform-
ance as breeders, they would have high conversion
ratios, and fuel cycle costs would be low enough to
compete favorably with other converter reactors. They
could use either 22*U or plutonium as the fissile fuel.
Design and operation of these simplified molten-salt

reactors would yield valuable experience directly appli-

cable to the high-performance breeders to follow. The
plants would be simplified in two major areas: (1) the

Xv

marily due to the (n, a) reactions associated with the
lithium in the fuel salt. A large percentage of the
production might reach the steam system in the MSBR
reference design, but increasing the system purge gas -
flow rates and the tube wall resistances and taking
advantage of the chemical characteristics of the fluoro-
borate secondary salt could sharply reduce the amount.
Further studies are being made of the behavior of

- tritium.

treatment of the fuel salt would consist simply in .

recovery of uranium by fluoride volatility and discard
of the carrier salt after it became too contaminated for
economical operation; (2) lower power densities in the
reactor core would allow a graphite life equal to that of
the rest of the plant, thus simplifying the reactor
design, reducing the amount of equipment needed for
core maintenance, and moderating the risks and nui-
sances involved in disposal of a series of spent reactor

- cores.

One of these first-generation-type molten-salt reactors
given particular study has a relatively large core (26 ft
in diameter and 26 ft high) with graphite core elements
and flow arrangements very similar to those used in the
MSRE. The graphite is constrained in position by grids
at the top and bottom, and a 2%-ftthick graphite
reflector is provided for neutron economy and vessel
wall protection. The core graphite would not normally
require teplacement over the 30-year life of the plant.

Another of the simplified types of molten=salt re-
actors given brief study has a spherical reactor vessel
containing 6-in.-diam graphite spheres as the moderator.
Removal and replacement of the balls would probably
be easier than handling the long graphite prisms used in
other designs,but the concept has the disadvantage that
the salt fraction in the packed bed is about 0.37, too
high to be economical when the core is made large
enough to obtain a 30-year life. _

The primary heat exchangers used in the MSBR
reference design are of the shell-and-tube type, and the
only practical maintenance method for repairing tube
leaks would be replacement of the tube bundle. A brief

study was made of a different heat exchanger concept

employing bayonet-type tubes which could be repaired
individually. The inventory of fuel salt held in the heat
exchanger tubes would be increased by about 30%, but
the ‘design may have merit, particularly in that the
bayonet-tube construction would: greatly reduce the
estimated amount of tritium reaching the steam system.

A preliminary study was made of the distribution of
tritium in 1000-Mw(e) MSBR power stations. About
2420 curies/day of tritium would be produced, pri-

6. Reactor Physics

A new fuel cycle analysis for the reference single-fluid
MSBR takes into account small modifications in system
description, salt composition, and treatment of chem-
ical processing that have occurred since the previous
progress report. In addition, the quoted fuel cycle cost
now includes the cost of replacing core graphite because
of radiation damage effects.

“Temperature coefficients of reactivity were calculated
for the reference MSBR. The reactivity coefficient

‘associated with uniform changes in fuel salt tempera-

ture is —3.5 X 107 &k/k per °C, while that associated
with graphite temperature is +2.3 X 107 8§k/k per °C.
The overall isothermal temperature coefficient of reac-
tivity is calculated to be —1.2 X 10~5 8k/k per °C.

A small amount of reactivity control can be achieved
in an MSBR, without any loss of neutrons by capture in
unproductive control poisons, by using graphite rods to
displace fuel salt from circular passages in the graphite
moderator. Because the effect of such rods, even if
centrally located in the core, is expected to be quite
small, and because self-shielding effects of neutron
resonance cross sections are expected to be rather
complex and important, reactivity worth calculations
for such rods have been performed with the help of
advanced Monte Carlo methods. The calculated reac-
tivity effect of four such rods 4 in. in diameter grouped
around- the core center line is calculated to be about
0.33% (roughly 2 dollars in reactivity), and the calcula-
tions suggest that the effect of a smaller number of rods
is proportional to their number.

Fuel cycle calculations for several conceptual designs

- of moltensalt converter reactors indicate that variations

in design permitting 30-year operation without graphite

- replacement, as well as variations in fuel cycle which
permit - operation without continuous chemical proc-

essing, may produce quite small increases in fuel cycle
cost relative to the reference MSBR. A large converter
reactor with a structure similar to that of the MSRE
and requiring neither graphite replacement nor chemical
processing (other than batch fluorination of the salt for

 
 

 

uranium recovery) is estimated to have a fuel cycle cost
~0.1 mill/kwhr(e) greater than that of the reference
MSBR. Such reactors can effectively utilize plutonium
discharged from water-moderated reactors.

Xvi

-Calculations of the fuel conversion ratio were carried .

out for different rates of chemical processing and for

different fissile feed materials (333U, 235U, or PWR

plutonium) for cases in which the conversion ratio is
less than 1. The results -illustrate the importance of
rapid removal of 233Pa as well as of fission products
and indicate that plutonium discharged from light-water

reactors should be a very satisfactory fuel for molten-

salt converter reactors.

" Detailed consideration of fuel depletion, 236U build-

up, and time-dependent 24°Pa/?3°Pu ratios, as well as
a careful reexamination of heat balances, now indicates
that nominal full power of the MSRE was about 7.25
Mw(th), rather than 8 Mw as previously believed.

| 7. Systems and Components Developir_)ent

- The preparation of the conceptual system design

description for the steam generator tube test stand is
nearing completion. All sections have been written and
are bemg combined into a rough d:aft for internal
review,

The 800-gpm NaBF4 test loop was operated for a
total of 2954 hr during the report period to continue
the investigation of the removal of salt and acid liquid
~ that is carried out of the pump bowl in the offgas
stream. Four different designs of hot mist traps were
tested. One type passed an excessive fraction of the
solids. Another design removed the solids but plugged
at the exit with a carbon-like deposit. A third removed
76% of the solids but also plugged at the discharge. The
fourth design removed almost all solids and did not
form a plug in the discharge. The acid liquid, thought to
be a BF;-H, O compound and oil mixture, was removed

- A proposal to provide the MSBE salt pumps was
received from Westinghouse Electro Mechanical Divi-
sion, Cheswick, Pennsylvania. The Bingham-Willamette
Company and the Byron Jackson Pump Company
declined to propose. The single proposal was reviewed,
and a list of comments and questlons was submltted to
Westinghouse.

The Preliminary System Design Description (PSDD)
for the salt pump test stand was completed and issued.
Work on the pump test stand was suspended to be
resumed at a later date. :

The final fabrication of the ALPHA pump that is

. being designed for small test loops is progressing.

- Fabrication and assembly of the water test stand were

completed.

The remote welding program concentrated on para-
metric studies of pipe end configurations and weld
inserts to find the best joint design for use in remote
welding. All the welding tests were performed with the
orbital equipment, including a new and improved
programmer-controller which provided very effective
automatic self-regulatmg control of the welding var-
1abIes

8_. MSBR Instrumentation and Controls -

Simulation studies of . the reference 1000-Mw(e)
MSBR on an analog computer were continued. The
basic plant components simulated were the reactor,
primary heat exchanger, and steam generator. A lumped
parametric model was used for the heat transfer system,
and a two-delayed-neutron-group model was used for
the nuclear kinetics. A provision for variable flow of the .
primary salt, secondary salt, and steam, with the
attendant variations in film heat transfer coefficients,

- was included.

The purpose of the load control system used in thlS

.study was to maintain the temperature of the steam

sufficiently by a cold trap operated at 32°F to prevent .

fouling of the.off-gas pressure control valve. A salt leak
developed in a weld joint in one of the loop pressure
transmitters. The weld was defective when the trans-
mitter was received from the vendor in 1956 and was
repaired by back brazing. Over a period of at least eight
years at a temperature of 1000°F, the braze material
was leached out by the salt, openinga path through the
pipe wall to atmosphere. This type of repair is no longer

recommended for salt service. The fact that NaBF, was

in the system was fortuitous, as any salt would have
acted similarly at this temperature. No fire, explosion,
or excessive corrosion occurred during the leak.

delivered to the turbines at a design value of 1000°F
during all steady-state conditions and within a narrow .
band around this value during plant transients. It
consisted of a steam temperature controller and a
reactor outlet temperature controller similar to that
used successfully in the MSRE. The investigation was
concerned with the integrated plant response initiated
by such perturbations as changes in load demand, loss
of primary or secondary flow, and reactivity changes.
The load demand transient results indicate a stable
well-behaved -system. Normal load changes at a rate of
5%/min or less can probably be controlled by a system
similar to that used on the MSRE with the addition of
 

 

-y

¥

9

the steam temperature controller. A change in load of
50%, from 100% to 50% of full load at 5%/min,
produced a maximum steam temperature error of 2°F,
The rate of change of salt temperatures was limited to
0.27°F/sec at the reactor outlet. Control reactivity of
—0.06% 8k/k at a maximum rate of —107*% 8k/k per
second was required.

Transients initiated by positive and negatlve reactivity
excursions of 0.15 to 0.20% &k/k were investigated.

‘The results indicate that certain reactivity transients

may require additional control if undesirably low
temperatures of the salts are to be avoided. For
example, if an insertion of negative reactivity into the
core reduces the reactor power, then the load must be

‘reduced at a rate sufficient to avoid overcooling the

salts. For a positive step in reactivity of 0.15% 8k/k, the
maximum rate of change of primary salt temperature
was 50°F/sec occurring at the reactor outlet. In the

secondary salt the maximum rate was 10°F/sec, and in

the steam it was 2°F/sec.
The loss of primary or secondary salt flow to a level

of 10% of full flow was also investigated. The loss of

salt flow in the primary or secondary salt loops
decoupled the reactor system from the steam generating
system. The reactor outlet temperature control system
was able to control the reactor outlet temperature
following the loss of primary or secondary flow with or
without a subsequent reduction in load demand. If the
load demand was not reduced, the control system
maintained the reactor outlet temperature within
100°F of its design point of 1300°F. When a reduction
in load demand to 20% followed 5 sec after the loss of
flow, the controller brought the reactor outlet tempera-
ture down in accordance with the accompanying
reduction in its set point (1050°F at 20% load). The
reactor inlet temperature, however, decreased well

below the freezing point of the primary salt upon loss

of the primary flow, due to the increased transit time of
the salt in the primary heat exchanger, whether or not
the load demand was reduced. Therefore, upon the loss
of primary flow, steps must be taken to prevent a
reduction in the reactor inlet temperature. Decreasing
the secondary salt flow through the primary heat
exchangers to transfer out less heat would probably be.
the most effective way to accomplish this.

The secondary salt temperatures also decreased upon

loss of primary flow.' To prevent an undesirably low
temperature of the cold leg, the load must be reduced
sufficiently fast. Decreasing the secondary salt flow rate
to control reactor inlet temperature, as discussed above,
aggravates this situation, since the transit time of the
secondary salt through the steam generator is increased,

 

Xvii

further lowering the secondary salt temperature. Upon

loss of primary flow, then, the secondary salt flow rate

must be decreased to prevent a low reactor inlet
temperature, and the load must be reduced sufficiently
fast to prevent low secondary salt cold leg tempera-
tures.

Upon loss of secondary salt ﬂow to 10%, the reactor
inlet temperature tended to increase and remain above
1050°F when the load demand was not reduced (i.,
constant reactor outlet temperature set point). When
the load demand (and the reactor outlet temperature
set point) was reduced, the inlet temperature remained
above 960°F. Some additional control action may be
required to maintain the inlet temperature above

‘1000°F upon loss of secondary flow.

Loss of secondary salt flow rate produced undesirable
decreases in the secondary salt cold leg temperatures.
Therefore, as in the case of loss of primary flow, the
load must be reduced at a rate sufficiently fast to
prevent freezing of the secondary salt when loss of
secondary salt flow rate occurs.

- 9. Heat and Mass Transfer and Thermophysical
Properties

Heat Transfer. — An effect of heaf flux on the axial

- temperature profile with a proposed MSBR melt (LiF-

BeF, -ThF, -UF, ; 67.5-20-12-0.5 mole %) was observed
in heat transfer tests in the low transitional flow range
(Reynolds modulus approximately 4000). The effect

- was manifested as a variation in the distance from the

inlet of the heated test section to the position at which
the local heat transfer coefficient became nearly inde-

- pendent of length; this effect is believed to be related to

the reduction in fluid viscosity near the wall due to heat
transfer from the wall to the fluid. ,

An attempt to obtain heat transfer measurements in
the low-Reynolds-modulus range with the test section
oriented vertically for evaluation of possible natural

~convection effects was unsuccessful due to numerous

salt’ leaks. A few  preliminary runs were made with

Reynolds moduli between 6000 and 12,000, where

natural convection effects should not be significant.
The heat transfer coefficients with upflow were about
12% lower than with downflow, but the difference can -
be explained by errors in measurement of inlet and
outlet fluid temperatures. Additional runs were made
with the test section reoriented horizontally, prepar-
atory to experiments with the more soluble gas helium

replacing argon as cover gas.

Thermophysical Properties. — The vanable-gap ther-
mal conductivity apparatus was improved by the

 

 
 

Xviii

addition of a heat meter. The heat leaving the specimen
can. now be determined by measurement of the axial
temperature gradient in the heat meter and computa-
tion of heat losses based on a two-dimensional heat-
flow model. The modified apparatus will be used -to
systematically study the thermal conductivity of fluo-
ride salt mixtures containing LiF, BeF,, and ThF, over

a wide range of compositions. From these measure-
~ments it is hoped to develop means for estimating the
conductivities of the molten fluoride salt m:xtures

having these same constituents.

Mass Transfer to Circulating Bubbles. — Successful
operation of the mass transfer apparatus enabled
preliminary tests to be carried out for determination of
the characteristics of the helium bubbles as a function
of liquid flow rate, gas flow rate, generator probe

position, and surfactant concentration. The bubble size |
distribution was well described by a log-normal proba-

bility function. It was also possible in the preliminary
tests to establish the operating limits of the system with
respect to the Reynolds and Schmidt moduli and the

~void fraction, and it was concluded that sufficient

ranges of the primary variables were achieved to yield
useful correlations of these variables in a fractional
factorial experiment. It is significant that the expected
linear variation in log .concentration with time was
observed in experiments with water and with water
containing a surfactant. The loop transit time, the
interfacial area per unit volume (from analysis of the
bubble photographs), and the mass transfer coefficient
can be obtained from this linear variation.

'PART 3, CHEMISTRY
10 Chemistry of the MSRE

“The cumulative results of MSRE fuel salt analyses
demonstrated that at termination of reactor operations

the total average corrosion sustained by the fuel circuit -

extended to a depth of 0.46 mil. The major fraction of
the indicated corrosion is attributed to airborne con-

tamination introduced into the reactor during mainte-

nance periods and when surveillance specimen arrays
were removed and reinstalled in the core. Analyses of
the circulating coolant salt indicated that during the
four-year period of its use the coolant circuit was not
corroded to any measurable extent. Correlation of the
distribution of ®5Nb in the fuel system with the redox

potential of the salt showed that when the concentra- .

tion ratio [U3*)/[ZU] was poised at ~0.5%, disposition

of °SNb toward solution in the salt or deposition

within the reactor was at a null point. Comparisons of a

series of 24°Puf?3%Pu isotopic ratios were made with

“ ¢alculated values of the same ratio over a long operating

period. From these, it was deduced that-the maximum
power level of the MSRE was 7.41 + 0.05 Mw(th).
Surface tension of simulated MSRE fuel and coolant
mixtures was determined using the capillary depression
method. Temperature coefficients, as determined by
this method, were in excellent agreement with previous
findings. The results permit interrelation of the labora-
tory results with previous values of the MSRE fuel as
determined in hot-cell experiments.

!

11. Fission Product Behavior

Examination of the fourth set of surveillance spec-

imens removed from the MSRE showed that omission
of the use of flush salt before removal of the specimens
did not significantly increase the amount of fission
products deposited on or within the graphite moder-
ator. One outstanding difference from previous results
was the relatively small amount of °*Nb found; this
was regarded to be a result of operating with the fuel in
an oxidizing condition for extended periods.
Investigations of the chemical behavior of fission
products in the MSRE were continued using double-

- walled sample capsules to minimize _cbntamin_ation. The
_results suggest that the bulk of the noble metals remain

accessible in the circulating loop, but with widely

 _ varying amounts in circulation at any particular time,
~that the proportional composition is relatively constant,
indicating that the entire inventory is in substantial

equilibrium with the new material being produced, and
that deposits occur as an accumulation of finely
divided, well-mixed material rather than as 2 p]ated
layer.

As compared with its distribution in the MSRE fuel
circuit, *Nb was found to behave erratically in
laboratory-scale experiments which sought to relate the
distribution of nicbium between the fuel salt and the
Hastelloy N metal surface to the redox potential of the

fuel salt,

Development of synthesis procedures for the noble
metal fission product fluorides and oxyfluorides was
continued. These materials were used in studies of the
valence of njobium and molybdenum as fluorides and
of their stability at low concentration in molten
Li;BeF,, and in Raman, absorption, and spectropho-
tometric studies of the pure compounds.

'13. Physical Chemistry of Molten Salts

Continued efforts were devoted to attempts to

develop ion exchangers for removal of lanthanide ions

from molten fluoride mixtures. Direct measurements of

the solubility of plutonium oxides in molten fluoride
mixtures showed that such oxides are unlikely to be the
saturating phases in MSBR fuels. Preliminary investi-
gation of the CeF5-ThF, binary system disclosed that
an intermediate compound (currently of undetermined
stoichiometry) is formed from these components; it

melts at 975°C. Solubility of CeF, in LiF-BeF,

mixtures was found to be limited, with CeF3 precipi-
tating from LiF-BeF, solvents with BeF, concentra-

tions in the range 33 to 60 mole % as the primary phase

at concentrations as low as 0.5 mole % CeF;. A recent
report of dimorphism in crystalline UF, was tested
experimentally and found to be erroneous. A correla-
tion of activity coefficients for various ionic species in
molten fluoride mixtures was devised as an extension of
the polymer model for LiF-BeF, mixtures and was
successfully applied in preliminary tests. Estimates of
activity coefficients of the alkaline earths as chlorides

or fluorides in molten bismuth were made possible

through recent advances in molten-salt theory.

In continuing investigation of nickel reference elec-
trodes in molten Li, BeF,, successful use was made of
sintered BeO as a container material for the reference

atypical of those adopted by the other complex
fluorides of the same stoichiometry.

‘Studies of the distribution of Ce, Zr, and Sr between
Bi and LiCl showed that these fission products will

data, of the probable chemical behavior of Na, Rb, and
Cs in the MSBR reprocessing plant. Experiments were
conducted to examine the potential application of

value. Studies of the effect of platinum additions to the

IS Development and Evaluatlon of Analytlcal Methods

Installation of a ‘hot-cell spectrophotometer and
related equipment for studies of molten-salt reactor
fuels was completed and tested with MSRE fuel.

 
 

 

Analytical equipment was installed at the MSRE and
used to measure the concentration of tritium in the
various effluent gas streams from the operating reactor.
A new type of reference electrode, employing single-
crystal LaF;, was developed for use with molten
fluorides. Continued efforts were devoted to the de-
velopment of methods for assay and control of water,
oxides, and tritium in fluoroborate coolant salts.

16. MSRE Surveillance Progrém

HastelloyN samples were removed from the MSRE
after exposure to the core for 22,533 hr at 650°C. The

thermal fluence was 1.5 X 10?! neutrons/cm?®. These

samples had a2 modified microstructure to a depth of
about 4 mils, and this region cracked profusely when a

- sample was deformed. The reactor had operated under

more oxidizing conditions than normal, but the exact
cause of the surface embrittlement has not been
determined. Mechanical property tests on these samples
revealed some further decrease in fracture strain from
the previous samples irradiated to a fluence of 9.4 X
10%° neutrons/cm?. Some heats of modified Hastelloy
N have been included in the surveillance program and
show improved rupture life and fracture strain.

'17. Graphite Studies

With the essential completion of the sugvey of

 radiation behavior of commercially available graphites,

the emphasis is turning increasingly to fabrication
studies and a better understanding of the underlying
phenomena. From a fundamental point of view, elec-
tron bombardment of graphite single crystals in the
electron microscope is proving to be an extremely
useful tool. Quantitative results on interstitial cluster
generation await better calibration of the microscope
operating characteristics, but the displacement energy is
being re.determined, and an upper limit of about 30 ev
has been established.

. Irradiation studies on bulk artificial graphites are

continuing, with recent efforts on lamp- and furnace-
black base materials and samples fabricated at ORNL.
In the latter program, preliminary fabrications have
been attempted using JOZ, air-blown, and Santa Maria

graphite . powders as filler materials. The air-blown

material looks most promising, at least from the
standpoint of isotropy.

XX

. Samples of low-permeability graphites obtained by

gaseous impregnation have shown a degradation in
permeability at fluences of the order of 1 X 10?2 nvt
(E > 50 kev). The undamaged samples possessed
permeabilities of the order of 10™® cm?/sec (He STP),
but this increased to ~1075 cm?®/sec after damage.
These results are subject to difficulty in interpretation,
and even the high values may still be good enough to
exclude xenon from the graphite. The experiments are
continuing. However, propylene-derived pyrocarbon
coatings in a free state have been observed to be

‘dimensionally stable under irradiation to >2 X 10?2,

and coated samples are being prepared for permeability
studies.

18. Hastelloy N

Alloys containing from O to 1% titanium were aged
for 1500 hr at 760°C and tested at 650°C. Generally,
the ductility and strength were increased. When alloys
containing from 10 to 20% molybdenum were aged, the
strength increased and the ductility decreased. An
irradiation experiment at 550 C involving six alloys
with titanium levels of 0.6, 0.9, and 1.2% each with
carbon levels of 0.03 and 0.08% showed generally that
the postirradiation creep properties at 650°C improved
with increasing titanium and carbon levels. Postirradia-.
tion expenments on alloys irradiated at 760°C and
containing various amounts of Ti, Hf, Nb, and Si are
incomplete, but the desired levels of these elements are
being better defined. Silicon must be kept low in these
alloys to obtain good properties, the precise maximum
level likely being about 0.1%. This undesirable effect of
silicon is associated with its tendency to form very
coarse M¢C-type carbides. None of the modified alloys
except those containing zirconium have given welding
problems to date. :

The corrosion rate of Hastelloy N in sodlurn fluoro-
borate has been shown to be very dependent upon the
water content of the salt, However, natural-circulation
loops have continued to operate under conditions
where steam was injected to cause a very high corrosion
rate. A forced-convection loop constructed of Hastelloy
N with sodium fluoroborate has operated over 6700 hr

~with an average corrosion rate of 1.2 mils/year and a

rate during the last 2000 hr of operation of 0.7
mil/year. A process whereby BF3; and HF are bubbled
through liquid fluoroborate was effective in removing
water. Hastelloy N was exposed to steam at 3500 psi
and 538°C for 2000 hr, and the average corrosion rate
was about 0.1 mil/year. '

19. Support for Chemical Processing

Back extrusion offers several advantages as a tech-
nique for fabricating containers of molybdenum. We
have produced several 2.5-in.-diam capsules which have
excellent surface finishes and flow patterns.

Three tube-to-header molybdenum welds were made

in a glove box by the gas tungsten-arc process, and no

evidence of flaws was detected. The orbiting automatic

gas tungsten-arc process is being evaluated as a tech-

nique for field welding of molybdenum.
We have shown that braze alloy composition and joint

design affect the compatibility of braze alloys with
bismuth. Less attack by bismuth was observed in a. .

molybdenum lap joint brazed with an Fe-C-B alloy than

in a T-oint brazed with the same alloy. The addition of

molybdenum to Fe-C-B braze alloys also improved their
corrosxon resistance,

Molybdenum and TZM were unattacked by blsmuth
after 3000 hr exposure in a quartz thermal convection

loop test at 700°C with a AT of 95 = 5°C. Severe

dissolution and mass transfer of niobium and Nb—1%
Zr alloy was observed after only 115 hr under snmlar
conditions.

The adherence of tungsten coatings to conventional

alloy substrates has been found to be related to
substrate composmon rather than to differences in

thermal expansion between tungste_n and the substrate.
Bond adherence was evaluated by thermal cycling,
spiral bend tests, and tensile tests.

The effectiveness of several commercial coatmgs in
preventing oxidation and scaling of carbon steel during

thermal cycling from 650°C was evaluated. Croloys

having from 1.1 to 8.7 wt % chromium were also
thermally cycled from 650°C, and it was concluded
that more than 5% chromium is requn'ed for improved
oxidation behavior.

tained when the misalignment was as much as % ¢ in, A

failed pressure measuring device from a sodium fluoro- .

borate pump loop has been examined. The failure
seemed due to the corrosion of a brazing alloy that had
been used in repairing .a faulty weld. Four potential
bearing materials have been plasma sprayed on Hastel-
loy N by a commercial vendor. These coated samples
have been thermal cycled and seem reasonably stable,
The five failures that have been observed may be
associated with oxides that are present. "

 

PART 6. MOLTEN-SALT PROCESSING
AND PREPARATION |

21. Flowsheet Analysis

We have devised a new process known as the metal
transfer process for removing rare-earth and alkaline-
earth fission products from the fuel salt of a single-fluid
MSBR. The process uses bismuth for transporting the

rare earths from the fuel salt to an acceptor salt such as
LiCl; the rare earths are then removed from the LiCl by
contact with bismuth containing 0.05 to 0.50 mole
fraction lithium.

- The effective thonum—rare-earth separation factors
for the various rare earths range from about 10* to
about 10%, The new process does not require an
electrolytic cell. This is an important advantage over the
earlier reductive extraction process, which also had the
disadvantage of separation factors near unity.

A new process for isolating protactinium from a
single-fluid MSBR has been developed. This process
consists of fluorination of the salt to remove the
uranium followed by reductive extraction to isolate the
protactinium, Operation without an electrolytic cell is

- possible since the cost of the reductant (lithium or
thorium) is acceptably low. The process is highly
efficient, quite stable with respect to variations in
operating conditions, and requires a uranium removal

 efficiency in the fluorinator of less than 90%.

We have adopted a flowsheet that incorporates the
new processes for isolating protactinium and for re-
moving the rare-earth fission products from single-fluid
MSBR’s. Operating conditions which result in the same
reactor performance as that obtained with the prevmus
reference ﬂowsheet are shown,

. 22. Measurement of Distn'bution Coefficients
in Molten-Salt—Metal Systems

The distribution of thorium and rare earths between
‘molten LiCl and LiBr and liquid bismuth solutions is
_being studied as part of the development of a metal
‘transfer process for removing rare-earth and other
fission products from single-fluid MSBR fuels. The
distribution coefficient data show that, from'a chemical
'wewpomt LiCl and LiBr will be equally good as
acceptor salts in the process. Rare-earth—thorium sep- -
aration factors of at least 10% are attainable with either
salt. The distribution coefficients were not markedly
affected by changes in temperature, Contamination of
- the acceptor salt with a small amount of fluoride fuel
salt significantly reduces the rare-earth—thonum sep-
aration factor.

 
 

 

The distribution of barium between LiF-BeF,-ThF,
(72-16-12 mole %) and liquid bismuth was found to be
nearly identical to that of europium. Preliminary
studies showed that the solubility of metallic bismuth
in LiF-BeF,-ThF, (72-16-12 mole %) was less than 5
ppm at 700°C. The solubility of BiF; was found to be
~ at least 4 mole % in both LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %) and
LiF-BeF, -ThF, (72-16-12 mole %) at 600°C. Graphite
was the only material tested that was not rapidly
attacked by BiF, dissolved in fluoride melts.

23. Engineering Development of Process Operations

Minor modifications to the salt overflow from the
extraction column had the desired effect of improving
the flow control of both the bismuth and the salt
streams. Four hydrodynamic experiments (runs 5—8)
were made with the column. Run 5 was highly
successful in that stable flow rates of about 80 ml/min
were observed for each phase. Succeeding runs were
increasingly plagued by the formation of porous iron
plugs, which resulted from mass transfer of iron from
‘the carbon steel piping. The extraction column was
replaced by a new column packed with ¥ -in. Raschig

rings because of increased resistance to flow in the -

original column. This increase in resistance was prob-
ably caused by the deposition of iron within the
interstices of the ¥,-in. solid cylindrical packing.

Before the final hydrodynamic experiment was ‘made
in the original column, zirconium metal was added to
the bismuth for the purpose of inhibiting mass transfer
-of iron in bismuth.

. Experimental difficulties have been caused by using
carbon steel as the material of construction for reduc-

tive extraction systems handling bismuth. Significant

progress in molybdenum fabrication techniques has led
to the decision to build a small molybdenum reductive
extraction system consisting of a packed extraction
column with gaslift recirculation systems for pumping
bismuth and salt through the column. A capital fund
request has been approved for the project. The prelim-
inary design is under way, and metallurgical and
fabrication problems are being investigated.

- A bismuth-salt interface detector is required for
control of the interface location in salt-metal extraction
- columns. Equipment has been assembled for testing
eddy-current detectors for this application.

A study of pressure drop, holdup, and flooding rates
.in a 2-in-ID packed column was completed. Mercury
and water were used to simulate bismuth and molten
salt. Two different packing materials were studied:

%,-in. solid cylindrical packing and %-in. Raschig rings.

xxii

The data obtained with the Y -in. packing agreed well
with earlier data obtained with this packing in a
1-in.-diam column. ,

We are studying modifications of packed columns

- which will decrease the effect of axial mixing and

thereby improve column performance. The proposed .
modifications. involve placing devices at various points
along the column to reduce axial mixing across the
column at those points. Two designs -for “backflow
preventers” have been tested; these preventers resemble-
inverted bubble caps. The experiments demonstrated
that relatively simple devices are capable of reducing
backmixing to an acceptable level (less than 15% of the
net continuous-phase flow rate). -

We have developed an empirical relation that predicts

~ the effect of axial mixing in both phases on the

performance of a countercurrent contactor.
A study of axial mixing in a 2-in.-diam open column
using air and aqueous solutions of glycerol or butanol,

‘was made in support of continuous fluorinator develop-

ment. Data were obtained on the effects of the viscosity
and the surface tension of the continuous phase.
Equipment has been fabricated for the study and
demonstration of the metal transfer process for re-
moving rare earths from single-fluid MSBR fuel salt. A
quartz pump for circulating LiCl operated satisfactorily,

- although the tests showed the need for improved

methods for the initial purification of the LiCl in order
to prevent attack of the quartz. '
Radio-frequency heating is being considered as a

" method for generating heat in nonradioactive molten

salt in studies of frozen-wall fluorinators. Approximate
expressions for the rate of heat generation in molten
salt and in an adjacent metal wall were derived; the -
general validity of these expressions was substantiated
in tests with a system in which sulfuric acid was used as
a substitute for molten salt. Radio-frequency heating
appears to be practical for nonradioactive experiments,
although a number of problems with this approach-
must still be solved.

Several of the proposed ﬂowsheets for processing

-MSBR fuel salt require the use of electrolytlc cells, and

the study and development of such cells is under way.
To date, experimental work has been carried out in
static cells. However, a facility that will allow cells to be
tested under flow conditions at steady state is presently
nearing completion,

In tests with static cells, it was shown that a layer of

~ frozen salt can be maintained in the presence of high

current densities if sufficient cooling is provided.
Experiments with static cells were also carried out to
identify the source of the black material that has

formed in the salt during all the runs made thus far. It
was concluded that an ac component in the nominal dc
power supply was not responsible for the formation of
dark material and that the dark material does not form
at cell temperatures of 675 to 680°C. It was also shown
that a dark material was formed in the absence of
bismuth,

24. Distillation of MSRE Fuel Carrier Salt

Final analyses were obtained for the 11 condensate
samples taken during the MSRE distillation experiment.
The effective relative volatilities (with respect to LiF)
of the major components and ®5ZrF, were essentially
constant during the run and agreed with earlier meas-
urements from equilibrium stills. However, the effective
relative volatilities of the alkaline-earth and rare-earth
fission products were substantially higher (one to two
orders of magnitude) than values measured in equi-
librium stills. Contamination of samples during analysis

is suspected.

25, System Calculations

Material and energy balance calculations for the
reductive extraction process show that about 10 MW of

 

xxiii

- heat is generated in the chemical processing plant at

equilibrium operation. This heat rate is about evenly
divided between 233Pa decay and fission product
decay. -

A series of calculations was performed to investigate
the effect of the removal of individual fission product
elements on the performance of an MSBR. Changes in
the fuel yield and fuel cycle cost are given as functions
of element removal time for the most important fission
product elements (Nd, Sm, Pm, and Zr).

26. Continuous Salt Purification System |

Equipment is being installed to study the continuous
purification of molten salt. The first purification step to
be studied will be the hydrogen reduction of dissolved
iron fluoride; the experiments will be carried out in a
7-ft-long, 1% -in.-diam nickel column packed with Y% -in.
nickel Raschig rings. Installation of the equipment has
been completed, and the system has been leak tested.

Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment

“P.-N, Haubenreich-<

Nuclear operation of the MSRE was terminated on
December 12, 1969, after all the original objectives of
the reactor had been reached and many had been
surpassed. (The heat production reached 13,172 equiva-
lent full-power hours — over twice the 6000 EFPH
originally set as the goal for demonstrating operability.)
The reactor continued to run well, and as the termina-
tion date, set by budget considerations, approached,
experimentation was intensified, so that considerable

- At the beginning of the report period run 19 was in
progress, with the reactor being operated to observe the
effects of fuel pump speed and the type of cover gas
(helium or argon) on entrained bubbles and !35Xe
poisoning. These experiments, which had been going on.
with fuel salt since August 16, were continued through
September. As shown in Fig. 1.1, periods of operation
at very low power (7.5 kw) to observe !35Xe decay
alternated with periods at 70% of full power. (The
power was limited to permit operation at reduced fuel
circulation rates.) The depéndence of xenon poisoning
on pump speed (amount of cover gas entrained in the
loop) and the type of cover gas (widely - different
solubilities) was generally as anticipated but did show
the need for further refinements in the model used in
the system analysis. -

'In the preceding run (run 18) there had been no fuel
additions during the substantial fractional burnup of
233U required for the measurement of *23U cross-
section ratios. As a result the excess reactivity had been
allowed to reach a low level. Just after the start of fuel

new information was developed during this report
period. Part 1 of this report describes the analysis of the
reactor behavior, equipment performance, and develop-
ment work directly related to the MSRE. The studies of
fuel chemistry in the MSRE, with emphasis on the
behavior of fission products, are described in Part 3.
Part 5 covers the information on reactor materials that
was obtained from the MSRE.

Operations

 salt operation in run 19, three capsules of 233U

enriching salt were added to provide a wider operating
margin. During September, six more capsules of fissile
material were added to the fuel salt to compensate for
the additional burnup and fission product accumulation
expected through the end of the MSRE operation. All
the additions were made in the normal manner, through
the sampler-enricher with the reactor operating. For the
six later additions, however, the fissile material was
plutonium (94% 22°Pu). Special capsules with zir-
conium windows! were used to expose powdered PuF;
(about 30 g of plutonium per capsule) to the salt in the
pump bowl. Dissolution of the PuF; was rather slow in
the first addition, which was made with the pump at
reduced speed, but satisfactory in the other five

- additipns.

Preparations had been made for remote gamma-ray .
spectrometry of the fuel system? during operation and
at the end of run 19. The purpose was to study fission
product -distributions, particularly after the fuel was
drained. To help make the results simpler to interpret,
the reactor was operated steadily at full power for the

flast 30 days of the run. During this period the
sampler-enricher was used intensively to take samples of
gas and salt, to expose various devices for measuring
surface tension and fission product deposition, and to
add beryllium. Apparatus that had been developed for
measuring tritium in the gaseous effluents from the
reactor was also put into service, and the first results
were obtained. _

The scheduled shutdown began on November 2 with
the initiation of a fuel drain with the reactor at full
power. Scanning with the remote gamma-ray spec-
trometer began within 2 hr after the fuel drain and
continued around the clock for the next 17 days.
Spectra were obtained repeatedly at 1-in. intervals over
the primary heat exchanger and also on the fuel salt
piping and the fuel off-gas ine. =~ .

Plans had been made and preparations were under
way to install a sampling device on the off-gas line near
the fuel pump during the shutdown. This was to be
used during a final two-week run in late December and
early January. By November 18, however, the budget
situation had become so stringent that ORNL manage-
ment concluded that an earlier conclusion of MSRE
operation was imperative. Therefore plans for the
off-gas system work and replacement of the core

specimen array were dropped, and the reactor was
started up for a brief full-power run for more tritium
determinations and some final sampling of the fuel salt.
The reactor was taken critical for this run (run 20) on
November 25. After several hours at 80% of full power
to permit measurement of velocity and temperature
profiles in the coolant stack at reduced air flow, the
reactor was taken to full power and held there without
any interruption for 16 days until the scheduled final
shutdown on December 12. ' ,

The last run was a sustained flurry of sampling — 32
sampler-enricher operations in 16 days. These included
28 samples and exposures of various kinds, two
beryllium additions, and two additions of 233U, (Ura-
nium was added instead of plutonium to save a few
hours on each addition.) At the same time tritium
analyses were obtained on numerous samples of the
radiator cooling air and the fuel off-gas.

Also during the final run two measurements were
made to help resolve the discrepancy in the indicated
reactor power, (Salt system heat balances had been
giving 8.0 Mw, while nuclide changes indicated 7.2 Mw
as the maximum power.) Profiles of temperature and
velocity were measured in the cooling air stack, and the
gamma spectrometer was used in an attempt to measure

coolant salt flow by decay of shortived activities
between two points in the loop. Results (discussed in

Sect. 1.2.11) more nearly agreed with the lower ﬁgute
for maximum power.

The reactor was shut down on December 12 by

dropping the load, allowing the coolant salt to come up
to temperature, then draining the fuel. Gamma-ray
scanning of a spot on the primary heat exchanger
started immediately after the power reduction.

- Three hours after the fuel salt was drained, while the

freeze valves to the fuel drain tanks were being frozen,
the radioactivity in the cell atmosphere began to
increase, indicating a very small leak from the primary
containment. About 7 hr after the drain, the activity
began to decrease after having driven the monitor on
the recirculating cell atmosphere up to about 15 mr/hr.
Pressurization of the fuel loop and the drain tanks had
no apparent effect, and the activity continued to
diminish. A sample of the cell atmosphere at this time
indicated predominantly '33Xe. Since the leak ap-
peared to have stopped, the flushing operation pro-

ceeded. The flush salt was circulated for 17 hr to give a -

thorough flushing and to permit three samples to
determine its final condition. Before the flush salt was
drained, the loop was pressurized to 20 psig for 2 hr
without showing any sign of a leak.

Suspicion was directed at the freeze valves in the fuel
drain line because the leak was not evident while they
were frozen. On December 15 the freeze valve, FV-105,
leading to drain tank No. 2 was thawed, and the cell
activity began to rise. Thus the leak appeared to be in

FV-105 or its immediate vicinity. The rise continued

after air was turned on to freeze the valve but leveled

~ off about 16 hr later. Although it appeared that the

leak had stopped, two days later flush salt was
transferred through the fill line to ensure that FV-105
and the adjacent line were full of salt. '
Examination of recorded temperatures on and near
the freeze valves showed that the operation was
apparently quite normal before and at the time of the
leak. Radiographs of the welds at the freeze valve, taken

during construction, were reexamined, and no defects

were found. Thus the exact location and cause of the
[eak could not be pinpointed. Consideration is being
given to various methods of inspection that might be
used later (fiscal year 1971). |

Samples of the cell atmosphere showed about 20 to

25 curies of !32Xe, 16 mc of '3'I,and 20 mc of 321

in the cell. These amounts were low enough so that the

cell could be safely vented to the stack. This was done,

the cell membrane was cut, and on December 18 the

experimental array in the core was rémoved. While the

core access was being closed, a small amount of
particulate contamination {(Ru, Te, Nb, Mo) was dis-

‘persed around the high bay of the reactor building.

Mopping cleaned it up satisfactorily.

Meanwhile the heat had been turned off the fuel drain
tanks two days after the drain. Four days later,
temperatures in the tanks reached the salt liquidus
temperature. On January 5, 24 days after the drain, fuel
temperatures were near the solidus, and the tank
heaters were turned on at low settings to hold the salt
in the range from 450 to 650°F. (This range was chosen
to preclude the evolution of fluorine by radiolysis.)

The system conditions for the interim period between
operation and examination were planned, reviewed, and
approved before Christmas, and on that day, for the
first time in over five years, the reactor was left
unattended.

An article® describing the MSRE its operatmg his-
tory, and the essence of the experience with it was
prepared for the special issue of the American Nuclear
Society journal that was devoted to the Molten-Salt
Reactor Program. This article provides a convenient,
concise picture of the MSRE experience through July
1969. Figure 1.2 (an extension of the graph in the
article) outlines the MSRE operation ‘from the first
experiments above a few kilowatts in January 1966
through the final shutdown in December 1969.

When the fuel and flush salt began to freeze on-
December 18, 1969, it was the first time that any salt
had frozen in the fuel system (other than in the freeze

- valves) since the first loading of molten salt into the

fuel drain tanks on November 28, 1964, There had been
no difficulty in keeping the salt molten throughout the
intervening 44,364 hr. Other statistics as of the end of
operation are given in Table 1.1.

The MSRE operating staff was disbanded by January
1, 1970. Several engineers remained at the site, com-
pleting the analysis of the MSRE experience and writing
summary reports. MSRE maintenance specialists began
planning for a limited amount of examination work to
be carried out early in the next fiscal year. '

1.2 OPERATIONS ANALYSIS

Experiments conducted with the reactor during this
period included those on xenon stripping, the effects of
adding reducing agents to the salt, and the changes in

the distribution of fission products. Meanwhile im-

portant observations were made on the reactivity

balance, system dynamics, the power level, and the

amounts -of tritium leaving - the reactor in various
streams. The chemistry experiments and much on the
fission product behavior are discussed in Chaps. 10 and

" 11. In Chap. 6 are discussed the measurements of

uranium isotopic changes in MSRE fuel samples. The
other items mentioned above are discussed in -this
section.

1.2.1 Reactivity Balance
~'J.R.Engel

i

The zero-power reactivity balance results with 233U

fuel are summarized in Fig. 1.3. Since there is still some

uncertainty in the reactor power calibration, data are
presented for two full-power bases: 8 Mw, derived from

‘system heat balances, and 7.25 Mw, derived from

uranium isotopic-ratio changes in the 23°U operation.

‘The points with error flags were obtained when there

was a substantial circulating void fraction in the loop,
and the flags reflect only the uncertainty associated
with the value of that parameter. These data also reflect
an adjustment from previously reported results* to
account for improved values for the samarium that
remained in the salt from the 23°U operation. How-
ever, other refinements in ‘nuclide concentrations,
shown by the reevaluation of the 235U operation (see
Sect. 2.3) to be needed, have not yet been incorpo-
rated. These data fall into two groups, with no obvious
trend within each group but with a distinct shift
between 12,000 and 18,000 Mwhr. It appears likely
that at least part of this shift was caused by the new
experimental array that was installed in the core just
before the startup for run 19 (ref. 5). The new array
contained considerably more high-cross-section mate-
rials than the earlier arrays of surveillance specimens,
but no account was taken of this in the reactivity
balance calculations. Detailed calculations are being
made to evaluate the reactivity effect of changing the
array. Other refinements in fission product yields and
cross sections are also being made, but theu' effects are
expected to be small.

In spite of the apparent shift in the base line, the
reactivity balance was used successfully to follow the

xenon behavior (see Sect. 1.2.2) and the plutonium

additions, along with the routine monitoring of reactor

behavior at power. The plutonium that was charged
into the MSRE was added as pure PuF;, which had to
dissolve in the salt (rather than melting, as did the
LiF-UF, eutectic used in the uranium additions). In

- addition, the openings in the plutonium capsules were

sealed with - zirconium windows, which had to react
with the salt before dissolution of the PuFj; could

begin. ‘The combination of these factors required

exposure of the capsules for 3 to 4 hr in the pump to
complete an addition; the uranium enriching capsules
emptied in 5 min or less.

The first plutonium addition was made with the
reactor at low power (10 kw) and the fuel pump
running at 900 rpm to minimize reactivity effects from
sources other than the plutonium itself. The reactivity

- balance began to show the effect of the plutonium after

the capsule had been in the pump bowl for about 10
min. The capsule was left in the pump bowl for 4 hr
even though the reactivity balance showed no further
detectable change was occurring after about 3 hr.

‘Subsequent examination revealed a 15.3-g salt residue

in the upper part of the capsule that contained 5.5 of
the 25.5 g of plutonium originally loaded into the
capsule. Presumably there was simply insufficient agita-

- tion with the pump running at the low speed to move

salt through that region, The remaining five plutonium
additions were made with the fuel pump running at full
speed (1188 rpm), and essentially complete dissolution
was obtained for the same exposure times; salt residues
were between 04 and 0.75 g. Careful reactivity
monitoring during each addition indicated that the
dissolution was very orderly with no evidence of
anomalous effects. _

.If we deduct the 5.5 g left in the first capsule, a total
of 179 g of plutonium was added to the loop from the
six capsules. This should have increased the plutonium
concentration by 41 ppm with a positive reactivity
effect of 0.443% 8kfk. The observed reactivity effect
duplicated this value within the accuracy limits for
short-term changes, +0.04% 8k/k. This represents £10%
of the plutonium added or ~4 ppm in concentration.

Analytical results of plutonium concentration measure-

ments are presented in Sect. 10.3.

1.2.2 Xenon Poisoning
J.R.Engel R, C, Steffy

Observations of the xenon poisoning under various
conditions were continued throughout the operation of
the reactor. The previously reported® differences in the
behavior of circulating bubbles with helium and argon

cover gases had suggested that the Xenon stripping
effect might also be different. Xenon poisoning was

measured with both cover gases at a variety of fuel -

pump speeds that gave core void fractions covering the
range from zero to 0.7 vol %. (The correlation between
fuel pump speed and core void- fraction had bee-

established earlier at zero power.) The xenon measure-

-ments were made at a reactor power level of 5.5 Mw

(70% of full power) so that low pump speeds could be
attained within the desired range of system tempera-
tures. The results are shown in Fig. 1.4. The data with

helium cover gas followed the same general pattern

observed previously® at 7 Mw. However, with argon a
marked difference was observed as the void fraction
approached zero; instead of decreasing, the xenon
poisoning continued to increase, reaching nearly 0.9%
8k/k at zero voids. -

In the early predictions of the effect of circulating

voids on xenon behavior,” the cover gas was treated as a
totally insoluble material, and it was predicted that the
poison fraction would decrease monotonically with
increasing void fraction. Although the xenon poisoning
observed with argon at zero voids did not quite reach
the value that would be predicted by such a treatment
(see Sect. 1.3) the relation to void fraction was
qualitatively very similar to the prediction. Since the
solubility of argon in molten salt is less than that of
helium by a factor of 10, it appears possible that the
deviations from the idealized treatment (minor for

argon but major for helium) are caused by solublhty

effects.

- The pronounced effects of core void fractlon on
xenon poisoning that are evident in Fig. 1.4 cannot be
described adequately by a simple analytical model of
the fuel system. It had been shown that, for a soluble

gas at low void fractions, the void fraction can vary
- widely around the loop.® That such variations influence

xenon behavior was illustrated by two measurements
made with helium cover gas at fuel pump speeds of 600

and 900 rpm. In both cases the core void fraction was

zero. However, 900 rpm is near the threshold for
bubbles in the core, so voids were probably present in
other parts of the loop. (The core is the only region in
which small void fractions could be detected with
reasonable confidence.) The xenon poisonings at 5.5
Mw for the 600- and 900-rpm pump speeds were 0.36
and 0.23% 8k/k respectively. Thus the out-of-core voids
appear to have had some stripping effect.

A computer program was prepared that includes the
dynamic behavior of the cover gas bubbles and treats
the various xenon transport pheriomena in some detail
in a 23d-order system of equations, This program was
designed to permit evaluation of both steady-state and
transient xenon effects in an effort to find a set of
system parameters that fit the observed effects. Results

.are not yet available at this writing.

The preceding discussion- deals with d1fferences ob-
served over a relatively short period of time., However,
significant long-term variations in xenon poisoning were
also observed when the reactor operating conditions

were nominally the same., Table 1.2 lists some typical .

values observed at full power during the 223U opera-

tion with full pump speed and helium cover gas; the -

integrated power (based on 8 Mw full power) is shown
for each point to provide a frame of reference. At least

one similar change in xXenon poisoning was observed
during the 23%U operation. Early in that operation
(May 1966) the full-power xenon poisoning was 0.35%
8k/k; later values were in the range 0.26 to 0.28%, and
near the end of the operation, it was 0.35% again. No
correlation with other aspects of the operation has yet
been found.. |

1.2.3 Dynamics Testing
R. C. Steffy

The only dynamics tests performed on the reactor
during this report period were primarily for research
aimed at improving frequency-response results by using
test signals which had signal power only at certain
predetermined frequencies. These tests were designed
and analyzed by M. R, Buckner and T. W, Kerlin of the
Nuclear Engineering Department of the University of
Tennessee as part of a graduate studies program. The
frequency-response results from these tests did verify

- that the reactor was still responding in the expected

manner to reactmty perturbations.

1.2.4 Operational Diagnosis by Noise Analysis
R. C. Steffy '

During this report period we continued to assess the
reactor’s operation by frequently analyzing the inherent
fluctuations in the neutron flux and in the pump bowl
pressure using detailed noise analysis techniques.® In

-addition, the ondine noise monitors® which were

installed just before the end of the last report period
functioned well, giving a continuous indication of the
average noise levels in the vicinity of 1 Hz.

During run 19 the pressure noise in the pump bowl
slowly increased as indicated by both the on-line
monitor and the detailed analyses in the vicinity of 1
Hz. Since restrictions in the off-gas line had been
known to cause increases like this,!© it was anticipated
that the off-gas line might be slowly plugging. The
detailed analyses of the neutron noise showed that in

the vicinity of 1 Hz it also increased, but the on-line

neutron noise monitor showed no increase, possibly
because it was not as sensitive to changes at a particular
frequency. During the first part of run 20, both the

pressure noise and neutron noise remained essentially
constant at abouat the same values which they had

attained at the end of run 19,

The pressure noise monitor was observed to have
several interesting characteristics during run 19 and the
first part of run 20. Each time the sampler valves were

opened, the pressure noise decreased by 10 to 20%,

presumably because the effective gas volume was
increased and this attenuated the magnitude of the

~pressure perturbations. Conversely, closing the over-

flow-tank vent valve to burp the overflow tank (OFT)
caused an increase in the pressure noise, as shown in
Fig. 1.5, by reducing the effective pump bowl gas space.
When an OFT burp was completed, the opening of the
vent valve caused a sudden surge in pressure in the
pump bowl that resulted in a large spike in the pressure

_ noise,

After an OFT burp on December 4 1969, it was
observed that the indication from the on-ine pressure
noise monitor did not return to its original value but
remained about 15% higher than the original level. Then
on December 6 the pressure noise level spontaneously
increased by about 50%, as shown in Fig. 1.6. This
increase coincided with a detectable increase in the

restriction in the off-gas line near the pump bowl. From -

this time until the end of run 20 the fuel pump pressure

-increased slightly during burps of the OFT, whereas it

had decreased when there was no restriction in the main
off-gas line. Of course, this implies that a fraction of the
gas flow into the pump bowl was bubbling out through
the OFT. On December 8 the pressure noise increased
by another 20% when the restriction in the pump bowl
off-gas line increased to the point that essentially all the
fuel pump off-gas began to flow through the OFT.

Features to note about Fig. 1.7 include: (1) The
pressure noise decreased when the OFT vent valve was
closed. Closing the valve caused an increase in pressure
in the OFT which stopped the gas from the fuel pump
from bubbling into the OFT. The bubbling action

- appears to be a strong noise source. (2) After the burp

the noise level approximately returned to its original
level, but the trace is seen to have a higher frequency of
oscillation. After a burp the level in the OFT was quite
low, and less differential pressure was required to
initiate bubbling into the OFT. The pressure noise trace

appears to indicate that at the lower differential

pressure there was more bubbling action than for the
higher differential pressure which existed with high
OFT 1levels. It is possible that when the OFT level was
high, differential pressure increased until a large bubble
was released into the OFT and that there was no more
bubbling until the pressure increased sufficiently for
another large bubble. (3) The average noise level was
slowly decreasing both before and after the burp, that
is, between successive burps. This is thought to be a
combined result of the increasing volume of the gas

phase in the fuel pump bowl as more salt was

transferred to the OFT and a decrease in the bubbling
rate. The neutron noise, both from the on-line monitor
and in the detailed analyses, remained essentially
constant during all of run 20.
1.2.5 Tritium
P. N. Haubenreich

Tritium is produced as a fission product at a rate of

about one atom per 10* fissions. In the MSRE this

source amounted to about 0.1 curie per full-power day.
Greater by a factor of several hundred was the
production from neutron reactions with lithium. Both

~ thermal-neutron reactions in 6 Li and fast regctions (E>

2.8 Mev) in 7Li are significant. During this report
period the calculated production rates for the several
regions of the MSRE were reevaluated, and an intensive
effort was made to measure the tritium content of the
various efﬂuent streams to detcrmme where the tntmrn
was going.

Calculated Production Rates. — There is lithium in
the fuel salt, the coolant salt, the thermal insulation
around the reactor vessel, and the corrosion inhibitor in

the water that circulates through the thermal shield.

The trace amount of lithium in the insulation is natural
lithium (7.4% °Li), but the other lithium contains less
than 0.01% ®Li. The greatest tritium production was in
the fuel salt, where the neutron flux was by far the
highest. The next greatest production was in the

thermal insulation, with its high $Li fraction. Produc-
tion rates in the coolant salt and treated water were
relatively very small.

The ratio of neutron flux in the fuel to reactor power
can be calculated rather accurately; the same is true for
the effective cross sections of ®Li and 7Li. The major
uncertainties in the calculation of tritium production in
the fuel are in the power measurement and in the ®Li

~ fraction. The production rates in Table 1.3 are based on

full power being 7.25 Mw. The SLi fractions were
obtained from assays of the LiF used to make up the
fuel salt, the probable natural lithium content of the

'BeF, that was used, and the calculated burnup of the
‘high-crosssection ®Li. (The fractions used are appro-

priate for the end of 22U operation and the end of
233y operation.) The production from ®Li was much

“higher with 233U fuel because of the higher thermal-

neutron flux resulting from the lower fissile concentra-
tion. Since the fast flux changed only slightly between
235U and 233U operation, the production from 7Li is
similar for both fuels.

The coolant salt production was due almost entirely
to exposure to neutrons from the fuel in the primary
heat exchanger (including delayed neutrons and neu-
trons from fissions within the heat exchanger). The
calculated rate was lower with 233U because of the
smaller delayed neutron fraction.

The big uncertainty in the calculation of production
from the-thermal insulation is the lithium content.
Analysis of batches of insulation that were to be used in
the MSRE showed 1000 ppm Li with an estimated
accuracy of a factor of 2. Later analyses of material
nominally the same gave around 10 ppm Li, The 3
curies/day is based on 1000 ppm Li.

Observed Amounts, — Tritium was obser\}ed to build

up in the treated water system, to occur in condensate

10

from the containment cell atmosphere, and to leave the

reactor in the fuel salt off-gas, the coolant salt off-gas,
and the air flowing across the coolant salt radiator. =

The tritium in the 4000-gal treated water system
gradually built up over the years to about 0.14 uc/ml.
The changes with time were consistent W1th the
calculated production rate of S mc/day.

Moisture condensed from the containment cell atmos-
phere generally contained around 1.3 mc of tritium per
milliliter. The condensate was collected (with other
liquid wastes) and sent in batches to the ORNL waste
disposal system. Records show tritium accumulating in
the MSRE waste tank at rates of 4 to 6 curies per
full-power day over, several intervals of a few months
each., _

The tritium sampling apparatus 'that was . developed
for use on the gaseous effluent streams consisted of a

heated bed of CuO followed by a refrigerated trap. The -

first analyses were obtained with the reactor at full
power near the end of run 19. The fuel off-gas sample

~ point was downstream of the charcoal bed, where the

fission product concentrations were manageable. The
first sample from here, with the CuO at 340°C; showed
9 curies of tritium per day. Raising the CuO tempera-
ture to 800°C, so as to collect tritium in all hydro-
carbons, showed 23 curies/day. On November 21, 19
days after the power had been shut down, tritium
analyses of the fuel off-gas showed concentrations over
half of what they had been at power. (The cover gas
flow was less, so the tritium flow out of the off-gas

system was down about a factor of 3.) After the reactor

was takén back to power in run 20, the tritium in the
fuel off-gas gradually came back up. Samples with the
CuO at 800°C showed 11.6 curies/day six days after the
power was raised and 15.0 curies/day after 16 days at

- full power.

The only sample taken from the coolant off-gas was
near the end of run 19 and showed 0.6 curie/day

~ passing the sample point..

Tritium in the form. of moisture in the radiator
cooling air was first measured early in October, using
calcium chloride to trap moisture from the air in the

- stack. Results of six samples ranged from 1 to 3

curies/day. The CuO apparatus could not be used
effectively on the stack air to measure total tritium
because of the extremely low concentration. In an

. attempt of circumvent this problem, a 2-ft length of

radiator tube was fitted with a jacket from which air

~ could be drawn to the tritium sampler. Sample results

obtained in run 20, scaled up by the ratio of total -
surface area to jacketed area, indicated only 0.2 t0 0.6
curies/day coming out of the radiator. Just before the’
final shutdown, four samples of stack air collected in
large bulbs indicated a total tritium flow up the stack of -
3.3 to 4.6 curies/day. Attempts in run 20 to repeat the
moisture measurements by the calcium chloride absorp-
tion method gave widely scattered results (0 6 to 18
curies/day). \ ,

The containment cell exhaust was sampled with
calcium chloride and also was analyzed with the CuO
apparatus. The former indicated 10 mc/day and the
latter 2.4 me/day.

Comparison, — Uncertainties in the SLi content of
the fuel salt and the reactor power level introduce 2
probable error of about 16% in the calculated produc-
tion of tritium in the fuel salt (40 £ 6 curies/day). The
observations on the off-gas downstream of the charcoal
beds indicated that there was substantial holdup in the
off-gas system but that the tritium effluent would
gradually build up in a long run at full power to 2527
curies/day. This is between 60 and 70% of the
calculated production rate in the fuel salt. '

Some of the tritium produeed in the fuel was
certainly diffusing through the heat exchanger tubes’
into the coolant salt, The amount of tritium in the
coolant salt off-gas, although relatively small, was more -
than the calculated production in the coolant salt. More
significant was the tritium that came out through the
radiator tubes. It appears that around 10% of the
tritium produced in the fuel salt left the reactor by this
route. Roughly half of the tritium in the cooling air
stack appeared to be in the form of moisture (based on
comparison of calcium chloride collection with total
tritium). The sleeve samples suggest that the tritium
diffusion rate out of the tube inside the jacket was
substantially less than the average for all the tubes
exposed to the main air stream, '

The rate at which tritium appeared in the contain-
ment cell (almost entirely in moisture condensed from
the humid atmosphere) was about 8 to 13% of the
calculated production rate in the fuel salt. This must be
regarded only as an upper limit on the amount diffusing
out of the salt systems, however, because production in
the insulation around the reactor conceivably could
have accounted for this much tritium.

Although the sum of the observed effluent rates is 12

| to 25% less than the calculated total production 'r_ate,

the discrepancy is hardly greater than the probable |
error in measurement and calculations. '

1.2.6 Fission Product Distribution in the Fuel System
A.Houtzeel R.Blumberg F.F.Dyer

Gamina-ray spectrometry studies of fission product
distribution in the fuel system were continued during
this period with the following progress: '

1. Gamma-ray spectra were taken of the main reactor
off-gas line (line 522) near the fuel pump with the
reactor at different operating conditions.

2. Calibration of the spectrometer equipment with
110m Aq and 226 Ra sources was completed.

3. Several components of the MSRE system were
scanned during the November shutdown period and .
after the final reactor shutdown.

4. Work was continued on a computer program to
automatically analyze the spectra.

 

5. Some preliminary analyses were made of the
gamma-ray spectra taken during the June—July 1969
reactor shutdown.

The equipment for this work was described previ-
ously.!! Figure 1.8 is a photograph of the detector
system in operation,

Reactor Off-Gas Line, — The gamma-ray detector,
together with the collimator body and insert, was set up
over a hole in the reactor shield blocks. Through this
hole it was possible to aim the detector directly at the

main reactor off-gas line, with only the cell membrane

interposed, at a location about 1 ft downstream of the
fuel pump. The purpose of this experiment was to
study any variation in the fission products contained in

the off-gas line during different reactor conditions;
xenon behavior was of primary interest. During this
experiment the reactor power was varied from zero to
7.5 Mw; other variables were the fuel pump speed and

the cover gas flow. Spectra were also taken when fuel

salt was returned from the overflow tank to the pump
bowl, during a beryllium exposure in the fuel system,
- and when argon was used instead of helium for the
cover gas. Altogether some 170 different gamma-ray

of their daughters, but it also shows clearly the presence
of noble metals.

Calibration. — An apprecmble effort was devoted to
calibration of the equipment. The purpose was not only
to determine the counting efficiency of the equipment

in the existing geometry but also to establish the

self-shielding effect of the MSRE heat exchanger along

with the heater elements. We used two sources for this

~ calibration work, a small 226Ra source to determine

spectra were recorded at this location. Another four

spectra were taken from 2 sample bomb in the main

reactor off-gas line about 45 to 50 min downstream

from the fuel pump.

~ The main problem encountered was the very intense
activity emitted by the reactor off-gas line. When the
reactor was at power, the radiation beam was more than
1000 r/hr directly above the hole in the shielding; the
neutron flux was also appreciable, By using the % g-in.-
diam collimator, 2 in. of lithium-impregnated paraffin,
and a Y-in. lead plate, we were able to keep the

counting rate down and the detector-system dead time

~ within reasonable limits.

It appeared that the then available computer program
would not adequately analyze these data because there
were too many photopeaks in the spectra (many of
these peaks also overlapped, i.e. multiplets), so the
detailed analysis was postponed. The results of a
preliminary manual analysis are given in Table 1.4, This
listing shows the expected noble gases and at least some

the detector sensitivity over a wide energy range and a
110m Ag source of approximately 25 curies to evaluate
the geometry and shielding effects. The 6.4-in.-long by
0.5-in.-diam silver source was placed in all the different
tube positions of the heat exchanger mockup. This way
it was possible to determine the effect on the detector
of activity in each of the different tube positions. The
silver source was also used to determine the detector
counting efficiency for the reactor off-gas line geom-
etry. Shielding experiments were done for the different
shielding materials used (lithium-impregnated paraffin,
lead, copper, aluminum, cadmium, and a heater ele-

_ ment).

Since the source was made up of three short silver -

~ tubes that had been activated in the ORR, it was

thought necessary to determine the activity along the

‘length of the source to establish an average source

strength in relation to the detector efficiency for a
given collimator geometry. Local variations of 13%
from the average were found in the source. However,
when the normal field of view at the source was
considered, the effect of these variations on count rate
at the detector was much smaller.

Approximately ‘435 calibration and related spectra
were taken, and the analysis is 95% complete. These
calibration data will be used as input data for the
automated computer analysis of the fission product
spectra. '

- Scanning During Reactor Shutdowns. — The shut-
down scanning program was started just prior to the
reactor shutdown on November 2 and continued for
almost three weeks in an around-the-clock operation.
The reactor was drained from full power, and no flush
salt was circulated. Gamma spectra were taken pri-

. marily from the MSRE heat exchanger and main reactor

off-gas line; other spectra were taken from the fuel
pump bowl, the drain tank, and two fuel salt lines (lines

- 101 and 102). Multiple spectra were taken to facilitate

the identification of both short-lived and longer-ived
species. This approach also tended to reduce statlstlcal

" errors.

main reactor. off-gas line, heat exchanger, and drain
tank through the holes in the shielding blocks. By then
the top shielding blocks had been removed, and the
remote maintenance shield was used above the reactor
cell. Especially during the first hours-after shutdown,
extra shielding was necessary to keep the dead time of
the detector system within reasonable limits. For
example, we used 2 in. of lithium-impregnated paraffin
and 1 in. of copper together with the ¥ ¢-in. collimator
insert. Two weeks later, a 1-in. aluminum shield could
be used with the ¥-in. collimator. ,
During the first three weeks, 235 spectra were taken
from the heat exchanger, mostly along the longitudinal
center line. Ninety spectra were taken along the first
few feet of the main reactor off-gas line immediately
downstream of the pump. Fourteen spectra were taken
from the drain tank and a total of 35 from the main
fuel lines (lines 101 and 102) and the fuel pump bowl.
It is obvious that the drain tank, fuel lines, and pump
bowl data can only furnish qualitative information,

spectra. These results will be used with the same

product spectra.
Results. — None of the fission product spectra has

. been completely analyzed at this writing, However,

some of the data obtained from the off-gas line and the
heat exchanger during the June—July 1969 shutdown
were treated manually. The results, shown in Table 1.5,
give some preliminary data for fission product residues

- four to five weeks after reactor shutdown. For compari-

since the calibration mockups did not include these

geometries.

Most of the spectra taken during and after the final
MSRE shutdown were from the heat exchanger. The
principal purpose was to study the effect of the flush
salt on the fission product residues, -

Computer Analysis. — It is clear that detailed analysis
of the large number of gamma spectra described above
can be performed effectively only with a digital
computer. The job is further complicated by the large
number of photopeaks in each spectrum. (Many spectra
contain more than 200 peaks with several multiplets.) A
program capable- of such analyses on IBM 360 com-

son, the data taken in November indicate that the major
activities after short cooling are !32I and ??Mo,
isotopes that had completely decayed prior to the
earlier measurements,

1 27 Graphite Samples chposéd in Fuel Pump
C. H. Gabbard
- The remote gamma spectrometer! 2 was set up on the

sampler-enricher for about four days, and a series of
gamma scans were taken on a special graphite sample, a

- copper dummy capsule, and a standard 10-g salt sample.

through the gas phase but would allow the graphite to
be exposed while the capsule was submerged in the salt.

' The samples were placed on a special fixture in the 3A

area of the sampler-enricher directly below the removal -

tube. The graphite capsule could be opened on this
fixture, exposing the bare graphite for. counting. The

specimens were counted through a Plexiglas window .

which maintained the containment of the 3A area while
the removal valve was opened for counting.

We were able to begin counting the specimens about -

50 min after the exposure was complete, so that any
nuclides with halflives of 10 to 15 min or greater
should be detectable. About 20 gamma spectra were
recorded on magnetic tape, but no analysis of these
data has been completed at this time. The graphite
specimen was submitted for radiochemical analysis of
some of the longer-lived nuclides, which will be used to
convert the count-rate data to surface activity of the
specimen.

'1,2.8 Evaluation of Leak in Primary System
R.H. Guymon P.N. Haubenreich |

- The occurrence of the leak was clearly revealed by the
cell air activity monitors.

The general location of the leak was narrowed to the
vicinity of freeze valve 105 by the response of these
monitors to the freezing and thawing of the salt in this
valve and adjacent piping.

The leak could be effectively stopped by freezmg salt

inside the pipe. Evidence for this is the lack of response

of the cell air activity monitors to pressurization of the
fuel system on December 12 and 13 after FV-105 was
frozen. Leakage occurred again when FV-105 was
thawed and the line was blown down on December 14,

Both because of the contamination in the monitor
and because the activity in the air was an unidentified
mixture of fission products, the cell air monitor
readings could not be used as an accurate measure of
the total activity in the cell air. Self-consistent and
apparently reliable information on this was obtained

from gamma-spectrometric analysis of samples of the -

containment atmosphere.
The amount of activity that leaked into the cell was a

tiny fraction of the total in the reactor. The 5.3-day

133%e in the cell amounted to 7 X .107° of the total
inventory, The 8.0-day !3'I observed in the cell

. atmosphere was less than 5 X 1077 of the reactor

mventory

- The amount of gas that leaked into the cell was
estimated from the ! >3Xe. Assuming that the contents
of the gas space above the salt during operation mixed
uniformly with the gas entering the fuel loop as the salt
drained, the xenon in the cell was equivalent to about 3
ft> of the mixture. The '*'I in the cell atmosphere was
the equivalent of the amount in about 1 cm® of salt.

1.2.9 Salt Transfer to the Overflow Tank
J.R. Engel

During this final period of operation the transfer of
salt from the pump bowl to the overflow tank followed
the same qualitative pattern established earlier in the
2337J operation,! 3 with the rate varying as a function
of the indicated level in the fuel pump. However, the

level dependence was significantly stronger near the end

of the operation. Figure 1.9 shows observed salt

- transfer rates for two periods separated by about one

When the cell air monitors did not decrease as expected

after FV-105 was refrozen, it was suspected that the
line was not full of salt, so some flush salt was put into

‘the line on top of the frozen fuel. Comparison of

133Xe concentrations in samples taken on December
15 and 16 showed, however, that the leak was nearly if
not completely stopped even before this step.

~ The cell air monitors erred in the high direction at
times because of radioactive contaminant that accumu-
lated in the line at the monitors. This was apparent

discovered when small amounts of water containing
much radioactivity appeared at a nearby gas sample
point.

year. The earlier data were originally reported as a
function of the level indicated by LE-593 (the shorter
of the two bubblers in the pump bowl). However, that
element suffered a substantial zero shift, so those
results were reevaluated, and all the data are referred to
the other bubbler (LE-596). Small zero shifts (1 to 2%)
still leave some uncertainty in the relative positions of
the two sets of data, but they do not affect the slope of
the relations between overflow rate and indicated level.
The estimated slopes differ by more than a factor of 2.

All of this behavior is in marked contrast to that

observed during the 235U operation, when the transfer
rate was low and largely independent of the pump bowl

level over the same indicated range.

1.2.11 Systexﬁ Heat Balance
 C.H. Gabbard

Efforts were continued in the attempts to resolve the
discrepancy between the reactor power indicated by the
heat balance and the power indicated by observed
changes in the isotopic ratios of uranium and plutonium

 nuclides (Sects. 10.3 and 10.4). Two tests were con-

‘ducted which verified that the thermocouples reading

the inlet and outlet salt temperatures at the radiator
were satisfactorily accurate. The tests indicated that the
thermocouple biasing procedure was applicable over the
full operating temperature range of the coolant system
and that the thermocouples were not affected by air

leakage from the radiator enclosure. Additional efforts

to resolve the power discrepancy included two air heat

~ balances, an attempt to measure the coolant salt flow

for all periods of significant power operation. The

change that accompanied the transition from 235U to

2337 fuel between runs 14 and 17 is clearly evident.

This is attributed to the increased neutron leakage and

fission heat generation in salt in peripheral regions
~ during 233U operation. Aside from this step, the

temperatures in the lower head show no significant
change with time. There does appear to have been a
trend upward in the thermocouple readings adjacent to

rate by radioactive decay of activation products in the

“salt, and a recalculation of the head loss of the coolant

system,

measured at a single point near the stack wall, and the
aitr flow measurement was made with a single-point
device calibrated when the stack was cold. Since the air
temperature could be nonuniform across the stack and
since the -velocity distribution could also change at
operating conditions, early in run 20 two sets of air
heat balance data were taken which included tempera-
ture and velocity profiles across two perpendicular
diameters of the stack.

One set of data was taken at nominal full reactor
power, and the other was taken at the maximum power
obtainable with one blower. The results of these
two air-heat balances were 6.98 and 4.82 Mw,
respectively, as compared with 7.96 and 6.31 Mw from
salt heat balances calculated by the computer. The

- corresponding values based on isotopic changes would

be 7.25 and 5.75 Mw. Thus the new air heat balances
did not agree exactly with either of the other indica-
tions. No explanation has been found for the greater
disagreement at the lower power level.

The reactor power levels indicated by these air heat
‘balances are lower than indicated by the previous air

heat balances (which were more in agreement with the
salt heat balance) mainly because of lower indicated
stack air velocities from a new calibration of the
Pitot-Venturi air flowmeter., The Pitot-Venturi was
originally installed permanently in the center of the
stack. Since the air velocity was not uniform across the
stack, the .calibration data provided with the Pitot-
Venturi were not directly applicable. The relation
between its reading and the average stack velocity had
been determined by velocity traverses with a hot-wire
anemometer at several flow rates with the stack cold.
Because of some apparent discrepancies between the
stack calibration and the manufacturer’s calibration, the
Pitot-Venturi was recalibrated in connection with the
run 20 measurements and was used to measure the

- velocity profiles directly. The new calibration, which

was in general agreement with the manufacturer’s data,
was adopted. The new calibration gave flows about 10

- to 11% below the stack mhbratlon that had been used

previously,
Coolant Salt Flow Measurement by Decay of Activa-
tion Products. — The remote gamma-spectrometry

equipment, which was on hand for studying fission
product distributions in the fuel system components

and piping, was used in run 20 in an attempt to measure

the coolant salt flow rate by the decay of ' *N and 2°F,
(The 7.1-sec '*N and the 11-sec 2°F in the coolant salt
are formed by neutron reactions with fluorine in the

~ primary heat exchanger.) Two holes were drilled in the

high-bay floor to permit scanning the coolant salt

16

piping -at two locations in the coolant cell while the
reactor was operating at full power. The two locations
were separated by a total circulating salt volume of 20.9

" ft3, which would give decays of 1 and 1.5 halfives

respectively for 2°F and ! °N at the design flow rate.
The detector was located near the periphery of the

reactor cell top shield blocks, where a relatively high -

background of both neutrons and gamma radiation was
unavoidable.!® Although lead bricks were stacked

- around the detector to reduce the background as much

as possible, a relatively large ‘% -in.-diam collimator was
required to get a satisfactory count rate above back-
ground. We expected to find activities of '®Nand 2°F

and had hoped to find a longerlived activity of some"

impurity in the coolant salt that could have been used

to evaluate a geometry calibration factor between the

two scan points. However, the only usable activity that
was found was the 1.63-Mev peak from ?°F. Peaks were
found at the proper energies for N, but they did not
appear to be coming from the salt, since they were not
significantly attenuated by about 6 in. of lead placed
between the detector and the coolant piping. None of

~ the peaks other than the 1.63 Mev from *°F were

significantly attenuated by this lead, and the peaks were
believed to be from capture gammas that constitute

part of the background radiation. Because the data were
taken during the last few days of power operation of
the MSRE, there was no time to refine the technique

- after analysis of the data.

The count-rate data were analyzed by the computer
program mentioned in Sect. 1.2.6. The count rate, or
20F concentration, at the downstream counting station
was adjusted to account for the salt density change in

‘passing through the radiator and for the differences in

reactor power that existed when the two sets of data
were taken. Corrections were also applied to the
downstream count rate to account for mixing due to
the bypass stream through the coolant pump tank and

for the line 205 flow that bypassed the radiator volume.

The residence time and coolant flow rate were then
calculated from the relative count rates at the two
counting stations. The coolant salt flow rate calculated
this way was 610 gpm, well below the 850 gpm
indicated by the Venturi flowmeter in the salt line.
Although the coolant flow calculated from the 2°F
decay is about 20 to 30% below what is believed to be
the most probable value for the flow rate, this
technique for measuring the flow appears to be feasible

detector efficiency and the radiation from the coolant lines.
The total biological dose rate was less than 2 millirems/hr.

if proper precautions are taken in setting up the
experiment. The large errors in this particular meas-
‘urement could be caused by differences in the counting
geometry or background at the two scan points, errors
in the system volume, or counting statistics.

Coolant System Head Loss. — The only important
uncertainty remaining in the salt heat balance is in the

coolant salt flow rate, and the accuracy of the primary
flow measurement device cannot be determined until

the differential pressure cells and flow transmitter are
tested next fiscal year. The flow rate indicated by the

Venturi has been trusted, partly because it was consist- |
ent with the design value predicted from the calculated

head loss of the coolant system and the coolant pump
performance. After the various measurements in run 20,
the head loss of the coolant system was recalculated at
the design flow rate to determine if this agreement was
valid. Instead of the original design value of 78 ft, the
new calculation gave a head loss at 850 gpm of 94 to 99

ft (allowing for a *15% uncertainty in the salt vis-

cosity). A somewhat larger uncertainty band is prob-
ably needed to account for a selection of the friction
factor and other unknowns. The 99-ft head would give
a predicted flow of about 800 gpm based on the
performance of the coolant pump in water tests. The
flow is not much less than the nominal flow, because
the original design had allowed for a 10% greater head
loss than the 78 ft calculated. Although the use of this
lower predicted coolant flow rate would reduce the

power discrepﬁncy, the final verdict on the power level
should be deferred until the differential pressure cells
on the Venturi are checked.

1.2.12 Heat Transfer in Primary Heat Exchanger
C. H. Gabbard '

There have been no absolute measurements of the
overall heat transfer coefficient of the main heat
exchanger since March 1968, near the end of the 235U

" power operation. However, the relative performance of
the main heat exchanger is indicated by the heat
- transfer index taken at full power and at full fuel pump
speed. The heat transfer index is the ratio of reactor
power to the temperature difference between the fuel
outlet from the reactor and the coolant outlet from the
radiator. Figure 1.10 shows the measured heat transfer
coefficients and the heat transfer index since January
'1967. These data indicate that the performance of the
heat exchanger has remained constant since the begin-
ning of power operation. ‘

1.3 EQUIPMENT
1.3.1 Salt Samplers
A. 1. Krakoviak

The sampler-enricher was used intensively to obtain a
wide variety of samples during the three months of
actual reactor operations in this report period. A total

six PuF; and two 233UF,-LiF fuel additions. This
brings the number of sampling cycles to a grand total of
745, of which 152 were fuel additions of either

uranium or plutonium. A description and the number

of each type of sample taken or addition made during

“this report period are tabulated below. Some of the

capsules were exposed as much as 12 hr in elther the

- salt or cover gas in the pump bowl.

During the latter part of run 19, routine sampling was -
suspended for approximately four days, and the sam-
pler was adapted to accommodate a collimator and a
germanium crystal detector atop the sampler where the
carrier cask is normally positioned. A plastic plug in the

‘removal area permitted an unobstructed view into area

3A, where samples retrieved from the fuel pump were
positioned. Gamma-ray spectrometry data were then
collected on short-lived fuel fission products within 50
min of their removal from the circulating salt stream.
-Although minor annoying problems were encountered
with the sampler and although repairs caused a few
days’ delay in the rather heavy sampling schedule, all of
the planned samples and additions were accomplished.
 

The main problems encountered concerned repair of
the manipulator and -of the two flexible containment
membranes (manipulator boots) between the manipu-
lator and the main containment box (3A). As in the
previous report period,! 7 the boots were replaced three
times; one replacement was due to a small leak in the
outer, or larger, boot, and two were due to ruptures in
the inner boot (in contact with the manipulator). After
the second failure, the boots were modified by length-
ening the boot by 2 in. at the small end and increasing
the boot thickness by 0.003 in. The negative ‘pressure
support rings which keep the inner boot away from the
manipulator rod were also eliminated on subsequent
boot installations.

During the early part of run 19, a small leak
developed in one of the convolutions of the metal
bellows which provides containment between the ma-
nipulator finger mechanism (in area 3A) and the
actuating rod (operating area). Although this bellows

- was installed during the summer of 1968 after the

19

capsule retrieval work was completed,'® it had been -

- decontaminated in an acid bath before and after the

1968 installation. The fuel processing sampler was
cannibalized to make this repair, and sampling was
continued. Contamination during repair work, although

adequately controlled, was more of a problem because

of the higher activity of the salt and the higher
frequency of sampling with various types of ladles and
capsules.

About a month before the end of run 19 -Serious
tangling of the cable, which had caused long delays on
previous occasions,’® was averted because the prox-
imity switch?® indicated something wrong on an
otherwise apparently normal insertion. When the mag-

" netic pickup did not actuate a light to indicate the

passage of the latch as it should have, the insertion was
stopped after 3 ft 10 in. of cable had been unreeled.
The cable was rewound with no apparent difficulty
until the position indicator on the reel indicated full

 

a higher position than it had been in at the start.
Somehow it had been lifted. Probably the capsule had
lodged at the sampler tube entrance, a few inches below

its starting point, and the stiff cable had been pushed

on down the tube past it. Then as the cable was
retrieved it must have snared the capsule and lifted it up
to where it was found. Because the insertion was
stopped before very much cable was paid out, no
serious tangling had occurred. The capsule was hung
again in its normal position, and sampling proceeded
normally with no recurrence of this problem.

During the latter part of run 20, the light bulb which
illuminated area 3A failed. A temporary battery-
powered light was improvised and inserted down the
periscope channel, permitting sampling over the week-
end until the light bulb was replaced on the following
Monday.

The double elastomer seals which contain the buffer
gas at the various valves and the access port continued
to show increased leakage, but it remained possible to
provide a positive buffer zone. For example, the buffer
pressure between the seals of the 1C access port
decreased from ~50 psia in 1967 (ref. 21) to 37 psia at
the end of run 19 and to ~32 psia at the end of run 20.
(The seal leakage was into area 1C rather than into area
3A.) Although the radiation damage to the seal material

_probably was becoming significant, the principal reason

for the increased leakage from this buffer zone was no
doubt the fact that the left-center Nu-vise clamp was
loose and thus ineffective in compressing the seal during
run 20. The increased leakage of buffer gas at the
operational,2?:23 the maintenance,?* and (during run
19) the removal valve was all from the upper half of the

. seal, This indicates that mechanical damage due to

withdrawal. The isolation valves were then closed, and -

the access port was opened. The cable had been fully
rewound, but the capsule was not hanging straight
down from the latch as would be normal. Instead it was
lodged diagonally between the ledges of the access port,

particulates falling on the valve was the probable cause
of deterioration of the valve seals rather than rad:atlon
damage.

During this report period the coolant sampler was
used to take eight coolant samples: four were salt
samples for compositional analysis, and the other four
were special exposures made in the study of tritium in
both the gas and salt sections of the coolant pump. No
operational difficulties were encountered.

1.3.2 Control Rods and Drives
M. Richardson  J. R.Engel

All three control rod and drive assemblies performed

- quite satisfactorily, with no difficulties, during this

report period. Tests in late September, early October,
and before the startup in November showed that scram
times (times for release plus travel from full mthdrawal
to lower limit) were all less than 0.81 sec.

Some studies of the system used to extract control
rod acceleration from records of position vs time during
drop tests>® were performed to explore the sensitivity
of the system to changes in acceleration. In these

‘studies an analog computer was used to generate a

voltage signal in the same range as that produced by the
position potentiometer on the actual rod drive. The
time variation of this voltage was made to simulate rod

20

Such tests were performed at least monthly during the
final periods of operation and at the start of each run.
There was no further evidence of abnormal drag on any
of the rods.

1.3.3 Off-GasSystems
~ _A.I Krakoviak

Although chronic plugging recurred in both the fuel
and coolant off-gas systems during this report period,

 the restrictions did not interrupt power operations.

- The early part of run 19 was devoted to a study of

~ the effects of cover gas solubility on xenon stripping,

position as a function of time for arbitrarily specified -

values of acceleration as a function of rod position. The
simulated signals were passed through the same data

recording and processing system used for the actual

signals so that a direct comparison could be made
between real acceleration values and those produced by
the processing program from position data. Com-
parative results were good for long regions (more than 6
in.) of low acceleration (as was the case for the stuck
control rod®® in June 1969). However, if a region of
zero acceleration as short as 2 in. was present at a
location more than 12 in. below the starting position of
the rod, the effect on the final curve of acceleration vs
position was nearly indistinguishable from other ran-
dom variations, The failure of the program to reproduce
such small aberrations was attributed to the filtering
and data smoothing that were required to reduce
random noise effects.

Because of the difficulty in identifying short regions
of low acceleration in a single rod drop from the fully
withdrawn position, the rod testing procedure was
modified to improve its fault detection capability.
Accelerations were evaluated for rod drops from just

which required several switchovers between helium and
argon and finally back to helium as the supply cover
gas. This -caused perturbations in system pressure
control. The inlet gas flow is normally held constant,
and the fuel system pressure is controlled by manually
throttling the valve at the outlet of the charcoal beds
(V-557B). The transit times (assuming slug flow) from
the inlet meter to the charcoal bed inlets and to the
outlet throttle valve are approximately 2 and 6 hr
respectively. The varying gas flow rates (due to the
different physical properties of the gases) at these three
primary restrictions presented somewhat of a problem

- of pressure control and pressure drop interpretation

above the normal operating positions as well as from

fully withdrawn. This would permit detection of any
tight spots within the first few inches of travel during a
drop. Since a very large restriction would be required to
stop a rod that has accelerated normally for 6 in. or
more, these measurements, coupled with the total drop
times, gave adequate assurance of rod drop capability.

during the transition from one gas to another. No other
operational difficulties were assoclated with the use of
argon as a Cover gas.

After approximately ten days of run 19 operatlons at
the 5.5-Mw level, the pressure drop across the main
charcoal bed increased from 3.0 psi with sections 1A
and 1B in service to 4.6 psi with all three sections in
service. The restrictions were partially cleared by
lowering the water level in the charcoal bed pit and
consecutively energizing the heaters-at the entrance
region of each bed for periods of 8 hr each. The
pressure drop across two beds in parallel was thereby
reduced to 2.7 psi; however, plugging at the beds
gradually increased over the next 12 days and reached a
pressure drop of 4.9 psi. The restriction then remained
constant for the next 20 days, after which it was
necessary to valve in section 2B also. Five days later it
was necessary to lower the water level in the charcoal
bed pit and reheat the inlet section of each bed. At the
end of each 8-r heating cycle, the heated bed was
forward-blown with helium at 25 psig. This procedure -
cleared the beds so that the pressure drop across beds
1A and 1B in parallel was lowered to 2 psi. No further
problems were encountered with the main charcoal
beds i in the subsequent Tun,
 

 

 

Particle trap 1 had developed a restriction of 0.7 psi
in May 1969, and V-522C was opened at that time to
~ put particle trap 2 in parallel service.?® Temperature

measurements within the two traps then and during

runs 19 and 20 indicated that particle trap 1 is still
restricted and particle trap 2 carries essentially all of the
off-gas flow. Approximately two months after the start
of run 19, pressure drop measurements on the off-gas
line seemed to indicate a restriction of 0.3 psi across
- particle trap 2 also; however, cycling V-522C between
its closed and open position cleared the restriction, thus
indicating that the restriction' was in the valve rather

than in the trap. Three days later the restriction

reappeared (0.3 psi) and was cleared by the same
method. No further problems were encountered with
the traps or valve.

Two additional attempts to clear the partial re-
striction in the gas line entering fuel drain tank 1 (ref.
27) were made. Helium at 30 psig and then at 50 psig
was directed from line 561 through HCV-573 and into
FD-1. Although only marginal improvement was ob-
tained, the gas flow through this line is adequate for
any reactor drain situation.

"Two weeks after the fuel fill of run 20, the restnctlon

21

directly below the hole that had been drilled in the top
blocks for gamma spectrometry of the off-gas line. A
tube leading from the discharge side of the filter would
penetrate the top rim of the reactor cell and pass into
the fuel sampler shield. A small tank that could be
evacuated by the sampler vacuum pump would be used
to pull measurable increments of gas through the filter
pack, thus permitting determination of concentrations

“of fission products in the off-gas at the pump exit. A

in the fuel off-gas line at its exit from the pump bowl

became detectable again for the first time since it was
cleared in July 1969. In the next three days before
reactor shutdown, the restriction increased from 1.3 to
2.2 psi as measured during the normal salt recovery
operation from the overflow tank. The restriction was
detected earlier by pressure noise data (Sect. 1.2.4);
however, because of the proximity of the reactor
shutdown date and the desirability of not interrupting
the experiment in progress, it was decided not to use
the heater which had been previously installed and
sucoessful]y used to clear a snmlar restriction pre-
v10usly

Interest in better measurements of the fission
products and tritium leaving the pump bowl led to the
design and fabrication of two off-gas sampling devices,
‘which were to have been installed near the pump bowl
after run 19. One device was a sampler to be used
‘during operation. A side outlet in the flange nearest the
pump bowl would permit gas to be drawn through a

connection into the tank was also to be provided for
withdrawing batches of gas for tritium analysis,
The other device, which was to be installed and

recovered after operation, was a tubular specimen array

to go in the off-gas line at the entrance of the holdup
volume. Its purpose was to characterize the state of the
fission products by measuring their distribution on the
surfaces. The decision to bring MSRE operation to an
early conclusion canceled the installation of these
off-gas sampling devices.

The sampling system?® in the vent house, which takes
gas from the fuel off-gas line about 45 min downstream
from the fuel pump, continued in service. In addition to
trapping two samples of reactor gas onto the molecular
sieve ‘during run 19, the offgas sampler was used to
make ten checks of the amount of hydrocarbons in the
off-gas stream. One of the samples trapped onto the
molecular sieve was taken while argon was used as the

- cover gas. This sample, however, was not very informa-

tive, since argon as well as krypton and xenon were
trapped on the sieve at —320°F. However, an attempt

* was made to boil off the argon and thus concentrate
~-and retain the xenon as the sieve was allowed to heat up
tO 32°Fo . .

The recurring restrictions at the inlet valves to the
off-gas sampler gradually increased during the hydro-
carbon’ determination runs. Back-blowing the sampler
valves with helium at 60 psig only partially restored the
flow. After two additional hydrocarbon determinations,

 the restriction returned. No samples were taken with

very efficient filter pack which would be located

the next month the restriction seemed to vary, as the

before it eventually exceeded 10 psig. The signal from
the coolant system pressure controller was then de-
tached from PCV-528 and attached to HCV-536.
Adequate pressure control was thus obtained (bypassing
the filter) until the end of run 19, at which time the
filter was replaced. No further coolant system off-gas
problem was encountered during the subsequent run.

ranged from 15 to 30 scffday until the November.

penultimate run showed no contaminant other than oil.

No flow test was made on the filter after removal. The
pressure drop of 5 to 9 psi that had developed across
the filter while it was still in the system agrees rather
well with the pressure theoretically required to enlarge
or burst a film of oil from a 1-u-diam pore if one
assumes that the bubble radius of a liquid film
produced by a pore is the same size as the pore. The

equilibrium equation for a spherical bubble is AP = -

20/r, where ¢ = surface tension = 16 dynes/cm for the
oil in the coolant pump and r = bubble radius = pore
radius = 0.5 X 10™* cm. This calculation indicates that
any pore in the sintered metal filter smaller than 1 p,
once plugged with condensed oil vapors, would remain
plugged at pressure differentials of less than 9.3 psi. The
slow pressure oscillation experienced could be at-
tributed to a near<quilibrium condition of condensa-
tion and evaporation of oil at the pores of the filter,

1.3.4 Component Cooling System
'R. H. Guymon

Component coolant pump 2 was used exclusively
during this six-month report period, with the other
pump (CCP-1) being held in standby. CCP-2, which had
been in operation for 500 hr at the beginning of the
period, operated another 2215 hr without difficulty.

While equipment was being checked out in prepara-
tion for the final reactor operation, the discharge check
valve on CCP-2 was found to be inoperative. This had
previously occurred in 1965 and was due to the
elastomer hinge breaking. Since then the hinge had been
replaced annually to help prevent such failures. It was

shutdown: During the final run (November 24 to
December 12) the indicated leak rate varied from 15 to
50 scf/day, and no trend was established. The usual
behavior after closing the cell is that the apparent
inleakage is high at first as the water vapor content
increases to an equilibrium value. After about one
week, the leak rate decreases, and at about the same
time condensate starts to collect in the condensate
collection system. No water was collected during the
three weeks that the cell was at negative pressure during
run 20. : .
During the six-month report period, particulate activ-
ity released through the stack was less than 0.3 mc. The
radioiodine release indicated by the stack monitor
amounted to 812 mc. Most of this occurred during the
removal of the core specimens described in Sect. 1.4.
The hold-down assembly had to be stored in the
standpipe due to a galled bolt. Salt and tellurium
adhering to this assembly probably contributed to the

-larger-than-usual release. Some 50 mc of the iodine can

be attributed to the leak from the primary system
which was described in Sect. 1.2.8.

1.3.6 Heaters and Electrical Systems
J. K. Franzreb
The electrical system in general gave good operating

experience during this period. The variable-frequency
motor-generator set was used to drive the fuel pump at

‘speeds ranging from 600 to 1170 rpm until September

16, when it was reconnected to the normal supply.
From September 26 to October 1 the pump was again
supplied by the motor-generator set. Thereafter the

~pump was kept at full speed until final shutdown on

last replaced- in April 1968. The failure of this valve

simply meant that if CCP-2 were to fail, the load could
not be picked up by CCP-1 because air would recircu-

‘late back through CCP-2. Since the only risk was

interruption of operation in case of some failure in
CCP-2, and because of the tight schedule, the final run

- was made using CCP-2 with no spare.

December 12, 1969. The motor-generator set per-
formed extremely well during this period..

One more heater problem dewveloped when heater
circuit CR-34 (coolant radiator) became grounded on
the heater side early in December 1969, Six of thirty
1000-w elements were put out of service, but there was
no interference with continued operation, and no
repairs were made after planned final shutdown on
December 12, 1969.

1.3.7 Oil Systems for Salt Pumps
J. K. Franzreb

The oil packages for both the fuel and coolant pumps

ran well and without major incident throughout this
report period. The oil pumps for both packages were
alternately run on a weekly rotational basis, and only
very minor priming difficulties were encountered upon
starting pumps that had been idle for one week.
Samples of both oil charges were taken on a routine
basis. The fuel pump lube oil was sampled six times; the
coolant pump oil, four. Analyses showed no significant

- deterioration with extended use. In addition both new

and used oil was analyzed for tritium. The oil in use
contained about 1 X 10~ uc/cc. o

The leak rate from the fuel pump lube oil system to
its oil catch tank (seal leakage) was measured at 13.2
cc/day. The corresponding leak rate through the cool-
ant pump rotary seal varied from 9.8 to 20.1 cc/day.
These leak rates are within the ranges prevxously

experienced.

1.3.8 Radiator and Main Blowers
| C.H. Gabbard

~The radiator and enclosure were inspected at the end
of run 19 and were found satisfactory. The routine
programmed maintenance was performed.

The main blowers, MB-1 and MB-3, completed opera-
tion with totals of 12,670 and 10,990 hr, respectively,
on the rebuilt rotors. The blowers have not received a
final inspection, but there has been no indication of
difficulty in the blades or hubs. There were more
bearing difficulties on the thrust bearing of MB-1 as
indicated by a vibration increase on September 9, 1969,
to 3.5 mils. The problem was due to severely worn and
corroded spherical surfaces in the self-aligning bearing
mount. We attempted to make temporary repairs by

locking the mount in the properly aligned position, but
‘the vibrations persisted, and the mount and bearing

required replacement. The mount had accumulated
12,550 hr of total operation. The new replacement

"bearing was defective and overheated after 10 min of

test operation; the phenolic ball retainer had insuffi-
cient clearances and had rubbed on the inner race. A

~ bearing of the original radial type was on hand and was
‘installed. Although- the original bearing type had a

shorter expected service life, it was believed to be

. satisfactory for the remaining operation of the reactor.

No further dlfﬁcultles were experienced mth either of
the blowers. :

1.4 REMOTE MAINTENANCE
- M. Richardson |

During the November shutdown between runs 19 and
20, the principal effort was assistance to the gamma
spectroscopy study described in Sect. 1.2.6. The reactor
cell top shield blocks were removed, and a large portion
of the cell membrane was cut away to permit move-
ment of the maintenance work shield. Some of the
drain tank cell blocks were removed, and a small part of
the membrane was cut to permit scanning of FD-2.

During the scanning, which commenced immediately

_prior to the fuel drain and continued until November

21, the work involved moving the maintenance work

~ shield to different locations and setting up the scanning

equipment. Each setup required about 6 hr, which was
later reduced to 4 hr as the operation became more
routine. There was a total of 12 operations which

“involved disassembly and reassembly of the mainte-

nance shield.

Two 2-in.-diam holes were drilled through the high-
bay floor in the southwest corner to permit scanning
the coolant salt lines (see Sect. 1.2.11).

The shutdown work after run 19 was to have included
the installation of off-gas sampling devices near the
pump bowl (described in Sect. 1.3.3). The job would
have involved permanent installation of a small tube
from the off-gas line, out the top of the reactor cell,
and into the sampler-enricher enclosure. The equipment

-was designed and fabricated, and the procedure for the

remote installation was worked out. The job was

~ canceled, however, by the decision to conclude the
- operation by mid-December.

Maintenance of the sampler-enricher during runs 19
and 20 involved considerable work with highly con-

‘taminated parts. As described in Sect. 1.3.1, during the

part of run 19 in this report period, there were two
manipulator boot failures and one failure of the
metallic double bellows at the manipulator finger

-attachment. The boot failures included one inner boot,
-which contains the metal O-rings, and one outer boot.
-There was one failure of the inner boot during run 20,

A total of 96 samples were taken during this report
period, requiring that the sampler-enricher be in almost

- daily operation. Thus when a failure occurred it was

necessary to make immediate repairs without waiting
for the short-lived activities to die out. In addition, due

‘to the many samples pulled, there was much surface

contamination in the 3A area, which read over 100 r/hr.
Repairs to the manipulator boots require that the

-shield, castle seal, and manipulator be removed as a unit

from the 3A area by using the overhead crane. The fit

 
 

 

of this unit in the shield is quite tight, and during the

- removal the unit was sometimes bumped against the

sample shield. Bumping resulted in the spread of the
surface contamination on the boots within the work
area. The work area was prepared before repairs

commienced and designated as a “C” zone. There was

- no spread of contamination outside this area. )
"The removal of the experimental array from the core

at the end of run 20 went well until a gafled bolt in the

24

hold-down assembly flange interfered with its reinstalla-

tion, The hold-down assembly was left in the standpipe,
and a blank ringjoint flange was installed on the core
access. Just after the flange had been checked leak-
tight, some particulate activity was released into the
high-bay work area. The total amount of activity was
not large, and there was no excessive exposure of
personnel. The activity was detected in widely sepa-
rated spots throughout the high bay, indicating that
minute particles had been carried by the air currents

induced by the large inlet air duct. CAM filters and

smears of -the - floor showed Nb, Ru, Te, and Mo
activities. Presumably this came from “soot” deposited
on the hold-down device above the level of the salt in
the access nozzle. In preparation for the standby
period, the high bay was cleaned by mopping, requiring

160 man-hr of laborers’ time.

The amount of activity released to the stack as a

result of the core sampling operation was greater than

- usual: a total of 0.80 curie of iodine was released,

nearly all in the ten days after the core access was
opened. Presumably this came from tellurium on the
hold-down assembly that was left in the standpipe.

Until the core access was resealed, an exhaust flow from

the standpipe through a charcoal absorber was main-

tained. Afterward the standpipe was opened to the

reactor cell, so it would have been possible for iodine to
get to the stack. . .
A maintenance equipment failure with significant

“implications occurred during the gagmma-scanning work -

in November. The 30-ton crane was being operated

- from the remote maintenance control room when a

failure occurred in its remote-control cable. The crane
had moved to the north end of the building with a
portion of the maintenance shield (leaving an opening
in the reactor cell top), and it would not respond to the
signal to drive south, Fortunately, where the crane had
stopped the radiation was low enough to permit
inspection. This showed that a wire had broken in the
multiconductor cable where it repeatedly flexed during

bridge travel. Because the failure occurred away from

the hlgh-radlation zone, repair was simple. As a result of
this experience, however, plans for coping with various

kinds of crane failure were developed in more detail,
and the 10-ton crane was equipped with bumpers to
enable it to push the 30-ton crane (which is normally
used in remote maintenance) away from any open cell.

1.5 FINAL SHUTDOWN AND STANDBY STATUS
R H. Guymon : ' '

After the core specimens were removed and a flange
was installed on the reactor access nozzle, the facility
was placed in a standby condition to await the
postoperation examinations planned for early in the
next fiscal year. The operating crews were disbanded,
but most of the engineers on the MSRE staff remained
temporarily at the site, completing analyses and writing

summary reports. The conditions at the end of this

report period are described in the following paragraphs.

The fuel salt is divided equally between the two drain
tanks. It and the flush salt in its tank are frozen,
between 450 and 650°F. All other fuel and coolant salt
piping and vessels are at ambient temperature. All are
filled with helium at about 0.5 psig, with gas infet and
outlet lines blocked. Equalizer lines between the fuel
circulating loop and drain tanks are open. :

The reactor and fuel drain cells are sealed, with the
roof blocks fastened down. The cells are held at about
—0.9 psig by continuously pumping S cfm of air out of
the cell past the cell activity monitor and into the stack.
Air is allowed to bleed into the drain tank cell through

a containment check valve. A simple water leg vacuum

relief device is installed at the pump to prevent
inadvertently pulling too high a vacuum on the cellsin -

the unlikely event of the check valve sticking shut.

One of the two stack fans is always in operation,
providing stack flow and ventilation throughout the
reactor building. The normal stack flow and activity
monitors (alpha, beta-gamma, and iodine) are in service.
One beryllium monitoring station is in service sampling
the inlet air to the stack filters. One continuous air
monitor and one monitron located in the control-room
area and one of each located in the high-bay area are in
service. ’

The electrical system is supplied by an external -
13.8kv feeder line. In case of trouble on this feeder,
the load will automatically transfer to an alternate
feeder, The diesel generators are available but must be
started manually. The instrument air compressors are in
standby, with instrument needs suPphed by cyhnders of
mtrogen

The heat from the drain tanks is dlsmpated thxough

the cell walls, with the cell air at about 140°F, The cell -

air coolers are shut off, and the treated-water system is
 

 

shut down but not drained. The cooling tower water
system is drained. Temperature and humidity control is
maintained in portions of the reactor building to
preserve the instruments and prevent damage from
freezing.

All gates to the MSRE area are locked and access
through the office building is controlled. Instrumenta-
tion is set up for out-ofdimit variables to alarm in the
control room, the office building, the X-10 Central
Waste Monitoring Facility, and the ORNL Emergency
Control Center as appropriate., A log is taken and
variables plotted daily, A thorough building inspection
is made and a more extensive log is taken once per
week. On weekdays this is done by MSRE personnel.
On weekends and holidays, personnel from the Central
Waste Monitoring Facility take the log and respond to
alarms. Written instructions are provided giving the
action to be taken in case a variable is out of limits or
an alarm occurs. Expenenced MSRE personnel are on
call if needed :

1.6 PREPARATIONS FOR INSPECTION
P. N. Haubenreich

Suggestions for postoperation examinations were
solicited throughout the MSRE Program organization in
February 1969. In October a consolidated list of -
suggested objectives and tasks was issued for further
comment. Subsequently each proposed task was evalu-
ated in terms of the importance of its objective, the
cost of doing the job, its interrelation with other tasks,
and possible significance in the ultimate disposition of
the plant. Development of procedures and design of
tools were started for some of the jobs to aid in time

- and cost estimates. By the end of the report period, the
task list had been narrowed, and detailed planning was
under way,

One important job will be to look for the leak. Figure

2.1 INTRODUCTION
‘B.E. Prince

During the course of nuclear operation of the MSRE,
the -standard computational tools employed for neu-
tronics analysis have been the GAM.II and THERMOS
multigroup spectrum averaging programs, together with
the EXTERMINATOR-2 group diffusion program.
Recently, another generation of programs designed to
perform these analyses and oriented for use of the IBM
360/75 and 91 have become available. These are the
XSDRN and CITATION programs currently being
employed in MSBR studies.! The former program
performs the combined spectrumi-averaging function of

~ the GAM-THERMOS sequence, and the latter replaces

2.2 EXTENSIONS OF MSRE CORE PHYSICS
CALCULATIONS TO THE USE OF
XSDRN-CITATION PROGRAMS

B.E.Prince

‘The particular approximation of the MSRE core
chosen for this set of calculations was a seven-zone
model in cylindrical (R-Z) geometry with azimuthal
symmetry. The composmons of the salt corresponded
to the minimum critical loadings of 235U and 233U at

~ 1200°F with the control rods withdrawn to their upper

the EXTERMINATOR-2 code. Descriptions of these

new programs may be found m refs. 2 and 3 respec-
tively.

During this semiannual penod we performed some
comparative analyses of the MSRE neutronics using
various combinations of these programs. This work is a
continuation of ‘a general evaluation and updating of
calculated MSRE performance characteristics described
earlier.? It was motivated by the interest of comparing
the use of these computing tools in a molten-salt
reactor application where experimental data are avail-
able. These results are described in Sect. 2.2.

Also in this period we examined the effect of the use
of revised and updated nuclear data on the interpreta-
tion of long-term reactivity trends observed during the

operation with 235U, This analysis included several

modifications which have been suggested over a period
of time since the reactivity balance calculations were
first begun. This work is described in Sect. 2.3.

limits. For a given fuel loading, neither the composition
nor the geometry was varied in the comparative
calculations summarized below.

The simplifications of the core geometry required the
cluster of three control rods and sample holder to be

“represented as an annular ring about the core axis. .

While this undoubtedly tends to make the relation
between absolute calculations of - the multiplication
factor and critical experiment observations more indi-

~ rect, the purpose of a comparative study of computing

26

methods, such as described below, could just as well be
served by taking advantage of the economy of per-
forming the group-diffusion calculanons in two-
dimensional geometry.

Table’ 2.1 summarizes the various combinations of
input data and computer programs used in this study
and compares the results in terms of relative changes in
multiplication factor and absolute spectrum-averaged -
capture-to-absorption ratios for the fissile components.
These two quantities can be used as simple figures of

merit for comparing the various cases, since both are

functionals of the distribution of neutron flux in energy
and position over. the reactor core. Cases 1, taken from
earlier calculations for the 235U and 223U loadings,
were -arbitrarily chosen as reference values for com-
paring the changes in multiplication factor. The details
of the comparison between cases 1 and 2 for the 235U
loading have been described in ref. 4. In case 3 we have
used the GAM-THERMOS-generated broad-group cross
sections as input for a CITATION calculation. In this
latter calculation the basic geometric mesh describing
the problem was constructed to correspond as closely as

possible to the EXTERMINATOR model. (In both
cases the mesh consisted of 37 and 56 intervals in the
radial and axial dimensions respectively.) Case 3 indi-
cates that the variations in the finite differencing and
computing schemes used in these two programs do give

rise to a small change in the calculated multiplication
factor. However, this change is of no consequence i in

this application.

In case 4 we have introduced the XSDRN multlgroup
spectrumA calculation, with its associated cross-section
library. One finds in this case a significant change in the
multiplication factor (~1.6% Ak, compared with case 3,

28

which uses the same basic cross-section data for 235U

and 23%U). By use of the CITATION perturbation

calculation, this difference was shown to be due almost
entirely to increases in the calculated broad-group

transport cross sections for the various nuclide constit-
uents in the reactor. The largest increase observed for
the graphite-moderated region was about 5%, occurring
in the thermal group. This appears to originate as
follows: In the present version of the XSDRN library,
the scattering cross-section data for the thermal energy
range include only the P, component (which is equiva-

" lent to assuming isotropic neutron scattering in the

laboratory system). In our earlier calculations we had
introduced transport corrections for the thermal group

~in an ad hoc manner using a standard reclpe derived

from monoenergetic transport theory.’ Thus it is

possible that the thermal transport cross sections used

in the earlier calculations may be more reliable in this
application. If these values had been used in the
calculation for case 4, the perturbation results indicate
that the difference in multiplication constants between

tron flux at the outer surface of the reactor vessel,
replacing it with the Milne approximation®. of 0.71A,;
for the vessel composition. The apparent importance of
this correction in calculating the MSRE neutron leakage
is reflected by the increase of about 0.9% Ak relative to
case 4. :

In the final case 6, for the 235U loading, we
examined the effect of modifying the broad-group
energy structure, placing more groups in the thermaliza-
tion range. (An examination of the influence of the
number of slowing-down groups on the calculations has
been reported earlier.”) Most of our calculations have

- been made for the few-group energy structure listed in

cases 3 and 4 would have been reduced to about 1.1%

Ak. _

The remaining differences in the calculated transport
cross sections occurred in the slowing-down energy
range. Of particular significance were the changes for
the nuclide constituents in the Hastelloy N reactor

'_ vessel, which accounted for about 0.55% Ak. Approxi-

mately 60% of this change appears to be due to
reevaluations of the nuclear data for nickel, chromium,

column 2 of Table 2.2. Here a single broad thermal
group was used, based on an effective upper cutoff
energy for thermalization of 0.876 ev. We modified this
structure as shown in column 3 of Table 2.2, placing
four “thermal” groups below 1.86 ev (the highest
energy to which thermal upscattering can occur in the

XSDRN model). Although there was a corresponding -

slight increase in the calculated multiplication factor

between cases 5 and 6 of Table 2.1, this dlfference is of

no consequence for this application,

For the 232U fuel loading, only two cases were °

" studied, which correspond to the comparison of cases 2

iron, and molybdenum since the earlier calculations

were made. The remaining 40% arises from inherent

differences in the methods of calculating transport cross
sections in the slowing-down range used m the GAM
and XSDRN codes. :

In case 5 of Table 2.1, we have modified the zero-flux
boundary condition on the CITATION-calculated neu-

and 5 for the 235U loading. No new feature was
exhibited by these calculations, although the net
difference in multiplication factor was somewhat larger
because of the increased neutron leakage for the 233U
loading.

The cumulative results of Table 2.1 dlsplay the fact

that the sensitivities of the calculated effective multipli-

cation factor and the fissile capture-to-absorption ratios

to certain details of the computation models are quite
different. The_ particular sensitivity of Ak.gs to those
details which most strongly affect the leakage calcula-
tion is not very surprising, for viewed as a critical
assembly, the MSRE has a large neutron leakage. (For
the 235U fuel loading, about 36% of the neutrons born
within the graphite-moderated region leak from that
region, and 31% of all neutrons born within all the
salt-containing regions leak to the reactor vessel; for the
233y loading, these numbers are increased to 44 and
39% respectively.) The general behavior of the
spectrum-averaged capture-to-absorption ratio for 23U
should be considered on a separate basis, however. Here
the Jargest change of about 5% occurred between cases
1 and 2 of Table 2.1 and corresponded to a substantial
revision in the basic cross-section data for 23°U and
238Q, as described in ref. 4. Between cases 2 and 6 of

Table 2.1, the maximum variation in this ratio is about

1%. Such differences still leave this quantity within the
standard deviation of recent direct measurements of the
average ratio for 22U in the MSRE .

Comparison of the relative variations in the capture-
to-absorption ratios with those of Ak, also suggests
the caution which should be taken in attempting to
correlate difference between calculated and measured
multiplication factors from critical experiments, with
any particular set of nuclear data (such as that for the
fissile nuclides), unless the critical assembly has been
designed to minimize or factor out neutron leakage
effects. For example, if the changes in multiplication
factor were due only to the effective changes in
capture-to-absorption ratios listed in Table 2.1, the

differences in Akg¢r between cases 2 through 6 would

be much smaller in magnitude and would, in fact, be
opposite in sign.

Finally, the results of Table 2.1 suggest that certain
stages and requirements should be met for a complete
theoretical evaluation of the MSRE (and possibly other)

critical experiments. Although no rigid rules can be

given, one can . identify three pos31ble stages for
analysis: _

1. Develop a particular set of approximate models for
the core lattice configuration -and complete core
assembly. Perform neutronics calculations with these
models, using particular choices of computing tools
and nuclear data libraries reflecting the current state

- of the art. '

 

8MSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Aug. 31, 1969,
ORNL-4449, pp. 70-72.

29

2. Identify those areas in the nuclear data libraries or
the computation approximations in which uncer-
tainties or misrepresentations may exist. With the
model for core geometry and composition fixed as

- in stage 1, systematically vary the data and the
computing programs or recipes in order to determine
which features most influence the important neu-
tronic characteristics (such as those figures of merit
considered in Table 2.1). For this type of sensitivity
analysis, the results of perturbation theory calcu-
lations are often quite useful.

3. Within the ranges of variation considered in stage 2,
choose the set of data and computing techniques
and assumptions considered “best” in some sense,
and apply these choices to calculations with an

- improved geometric/material representatlon of the
core assembly.

Considered together, these categories serve to illus-
trate the complexities involved in the theoretical
interpretation of a critical experiment. In the choice of
the model in stages 1 and 2, use can be made of various
economies in the calculation methods, for example, use
of two-dimensional diffusion-theory calculations as in
the present study. Calculations with three-dimensional
representations and other features with substantial
computing time requirements can often be postponed
to stage 3. Also, one should note that the analysis
provided by stage 1 is often sufficient for many
purposes (particularly in the MSRE, where small errors
in the calculated critical fuel composition had no
practical consequence in fueling). The description of
the set of calculations for the 23%U critical experiment
given in ref. 9 would properly be classed under stage 1.

In a particular application it may develop that stage 3
in the analysis is not clearly warranted. This would be
the case if the calculations in stage 2 indicate sufficient
variations in characteristics caused by uncertainties in

‘the nuclear data or computing approximations. In this

event, emphasis should be placed on improving the
rationale or accuracy of these approximations before
proceeding to stage 3. This appears to be the situation
in the present study, particularly for the approxi-
mations involved in transport cross-section calculations.
Efforts will be placed along these lines before any
further analyses of MSRE critical experiments are
undertaken.

2.3 EVALUATION OF LONG-TERM REACTIVITY
- BEHAVIOR DURING OPERATION WITH 235y

-B.E. Pnnce

Previous descriptions and interpretations of reactivity
balance data logged during the 235U operation! ®*!?
have been based on nuclear data used early in the
reactor operating history, together with the general
model and rules for calculating individual reactivity
effects set forth in ref. 12. The revisions made since
that time in the cross-section data influencing this
model motivated a reexamination of the reactivity

‘trends during operation with 235U, We have also

introduced certain changes, described and explained
below, in some of the coefficients governing the
conversion of concentration changes to associated
reactivity effects. In order to best exhibit the long-term
trends, we have considered only the reactivity balance
data taken at very low power, where any uncertainties
associated with the calculation of '3*Xe poisoning or
temperature distribution effects have a minimum influ-
ence on the analysis. An expanded version of the results
described below, together with extensions to include

* “reactor operat;on with 233U, will be given in a separate

report.!?
The particular modifications in the reactivity balance

_calculations, suggested by information and evidence

accumulated since the calculation model was first
developed, are summarized as follows:

1. Revisions in nuclear cross-section data combined

with self-consistent calculations of the average reac-

tion rates over all fuel salt exposed to the neutron
flux predict an increase of about 1% in the burnup
rate of 235U per megawatt-hour of fission energy and
an increase of about 20% in the net rate of depletion
of 238U (with a corresponding increase in the 23°Pu
production rate); a decrease of nearly 11% in the
average capture-to-fission ratio for 23°Pu, with
respect to the earlier calculations, is also predicted.

2. All terms in the reactivity balance with magnitude
" based on the results of zero-power rod calibration
experiments should be multiplied by a factor of 1.06

to account for an increase in the calculated delayed
neutron effectiveness. This correction, therefore,
applies to the rod poisoning, the excess uranium
-reactivity (relative to the minimum critical loading),
and the temperature level reactivity (relative to
1200°F).

3. A second correction should be applied to the
concentration coefficient of reactivity by multi-
plying this coefficient by 1.072. This correction
makes the treatment of the excess uranium reac-
tivity and the rod-poisoning term self-consistent in
the way these terms are calculated in the reactmty
balance.

235U

The sources of the corrections listed under modifica-
tion 1 were described in a recent semiannual report.*
These revisions affect the reactivity balance mainly in-
the calculation of nuclide inventory changes, with the
exception of the revision in the capture-to-fission ratio
data for 23°Pu, which influences the results mainly in
the conversion of 23°Pu inventory changes to associ-
ated reactivity additions.

The source of correction 2 was a recent reevaluation
of the “delayed neutron effectiveness” in the MSRE
described in ref. 14. All of the reactivity magnitudes
derived from the zero-power calibration experiments
were relative to the value of the effective delayed
neutron fraction, g, with the fuel circulation
stopped. ‘The absolute value of B¢, however, is
influenced by the energies of emission of the delayed
neutrons, which are lower than those of the prompt
fission neutrons. This difference introduces a correction
dependent on the particular reactor design, which must
be determined by calculation. As a net result, correc-
tion 2 amounts to a scale change in all measured
coefficients in the reactivity balance.

Correction 3 has its origin in the dependence of the
excess 235U reactivity (and also the control rod worth)
on the total 235U concentration. A theoretical expres-

sion which closely approximates the variation of excess

235 reactivity, p, with concentration is

_K(C-Co) "
where C is the 23*U concentration in the salt and Cp is
the concentration at the reference point of zero excess
reactivity (in this case, the minimum critical loading).

In this expression the parameter K is also the 23U

concentration coefficient of reactivity at the minimum
critical loading, that is, :

e

In our earlier analysis we had assigned a value of 0.223
for K, which represented the average coefficient for
235U variations made in the zero-power calibration
experiments.® More recent analysis,'® however, indi-
cates that a better fit to the data over the entire range
of 235U concentration variations is obtained by use of
Eq. (1) with K equal to 0.239. This correction is
independent of the additional correction for delayed
neutron effectiveness described above.

saturating or slowly saturating fission products and the
changes in Li, 234U, 236U, 238y, 23%py, 24%Py, and
108 content (the last in the graphite). In our reference
calculations the same assumptions were made con-
cerning the degree of fission product removal from the
system as were used in earlier studies,'! that is, that all
of the noble gases and none of the noble metals were
removed.

The results of revised calculations of these component
reactivity effects, together with their algebraic sum,
which appears in the reactivity balance, are shown in
Fig. 2.1. The most important change resulting from
these revisions is in the 2*®Pu reactivity component,
which increased by about 50% from earlier calculations.
The magnitude of the negative component associated
with buildup of nonsaturating fission products also
increased by about 10%, due to the revision in the
calculated epithermal-to-thermal flux ratxo in the
reactor.

The results of including all changes described under
categories 1, 2, and 3 in the interpretation of the
reactivity balance data are shown in Fig. 2.22. In this
figure we have attempted to distinguish the data points
based on measurements taken during separate power
runs. Transfer and mixing effects during drain and flush
operations between runs introduced variations in the
composition of the salt which generally had larger
uncertainties associated with them than the changes
produced during the runs.

The data shown in Fig. 2.2a indicate a small overall
positive trend in the residual reactivity during the entire
period of operation with 225U, (The residual reactivity
is essentially equal to the “observed” reactivity minus
the “predicted” reactivity.) One finds, however, that
the average upward trend in reéctivity during this
period is about 0.07% 8k/k, which is less than half the
magnitude indicated in our earlier studies. The statis-
tical spread in the data points logged over the -entire
period prevents one from assigning a precise shape to

the residual reactivity variation; however, the data in

Fig. 2.22 taken during the longest uninterrupted power
run (run 14) appear to be rising more steeply than the
average trend during 235U operation. Thus the slope of
the residual reactivity variation was probably increasing
dunng this period. ,

It is useful to note that part of any long-term upward '
trend in reactivity might be explained if the actual
amount of fission product removal was greater than
assumed in the reference calculations (Fig. 2.1). For
example, if complete removal of the noble metals Mo,
Ru, and Te had occurred, the residual reactivity would
have been reduced by an amount varying approximately

Recently, some precise mass spectrometer measure-
ments, made to determine the capture-to-absorption
ratio for 235U in the MSRE spectrum,® have indicated

- that the actual fission rate might be lower by about

10% than that indicated by the heat balance calibration.

the interpretation of the long-term reactivity trends, we
recalculated the individual terms in the reactivity
‘balance assuming that the maximum reactor power was
7.25 Mw. (Those terms which are directly affected by
the fission rate are the 2?°U depletion, the samarium
poisoning, and the long-term isotopic changes described
in Fig. 2.1.) These results are shown in Fig. 2.2b. The
variations in residual reactivity remain quite small in
magnitude and indicate a slight negative trend during
the first part of the operation, again followed by a more
gentle positive trend during run 14, Increased fission
product removal could accentuate any downward trend
by the amount indicated above. |

It is quite likely that either mterpretatxon of the
reactivity balance data described in Fig. 2.20 or b is a
possible representation of uncertainties in the model or
of other changes affecting nuclear operation with 235U
which are not explicitly included in the calculations.
The magnitudes of reactivity variations exhibited in

- either case lie within the region in which the calculation

model is judged to be valid, Hence the reactivity
balance data alone cannot be used to support a spe01f1c
choice for the fission rate.

In this connection it is interesting to observe that

- recent calculations by C. H. Gabbard'® relating to the

effect of dimensional changes in the graphite during
2357 operation exhibit variations in reactivity similar
to those of both Figs. 2.2z and b. These calculations
were made in an attempt to bracket the expected
reactivity variation due to deflections and density
changes in graphite stringers caused by fast-neutron
irradiation. In one limiting case these calculations
indicated that a gradual increase in reactivity could
occur, resulting in a net addition of about 0.06% 8k/k
during 70,000 Mwhr of operation. An opposite limit,
however, indicated that an initial decrease in reactivity

"could occur, reaching a minimum of —0.06% 8k/k at

about 50,000 Mwhr and then increasing again during .
further exposure of the graphite. Precise mathematical
modeling of the effects of the nonuniform dimensional
changes on the core geometry is quite difficult, and the
magnitudes obtained in these calculations are approxi-
mate. However, the results of Gabbard’s studies lend
further credence to the reactmty behavior exhibited in
Fig. 2.2 .

One other quite recent development should be
mentioned ‘which could, in addition to the fission
product removal discussed above, slightly modify the
numerical values of residual reactivity shown in Fig.

2.2. This concerns the assessment of the ®Li content in
the fuel salt. Reexamination of all available evidence
(Sect. 1.2.5 and ref. 17) now indicates that the most
likely average isotopic assay of Li which went into the
MSRE fuel salt preparation was between 0.005% and
0.006%, instead of 0.0074% as had been used in all
previous reactor analysis calculations. In accordance
with the calculations shown in Fig. 2.1, this would have

“the effect of reducing the magnitude of the component

associated with SLi burnout by the ratio of the initial
®Li concentrations. The net result of this change would
be to add an amount of reactivity equivalent to this
difference to the residual reactivity points shown in Fig.
2.2. Thus each point in Figs. 2.2¢ and b could be
displaced upward by an amount varying approximately
linearly between zero at the start of operation and
0.035 + 0.009% 8k/k at 70,000 Mwhr to correspond to
this correction. However, the preceding conclusions
regarding the validity of the reactivity balarice model
and results would not be changed by this modification.

Those sources of statistical variations and uncertain-
ties in the reactivity balance data which can be
identified include: (1) a component of about #0.01%
8kfk associated with random errors in reading rod
positions and temperatures and with short-term varia-

“tions in the amount of entrained gas circulating with

the salt and (2) a component associated with uncertain-
ties in fuel transfer during flush operations, increasing
in magnitude from zero near the start of power
operation to about +0.015% 8k/k near the end of
operation. Any remaining statistical variations should at

- present be regarded as inherent in the technique of

recording and analyzing- the reactivity balance data
rather than as evidence of some anomalous physical
process in the reactor. :

The data summarized in Fig. 2.2 represent measure-
ments accumulated over nearly three years of operation
of the MSRE. During that time 235U equivalent to
~125% in reactivity had been depleted in power
operation; 235U equivalent to 0.72% 8k/k had been
added to the salt; poisoning due to '*?Sm and !5!Sm

~ equivalent to 0.77% 8k/k had been formed; changes in

isotopic content of other constituents of the salt had
produced a net reactivity addition of 0.42% Sk/k. Our
procedures for accounting for these effects indicate that
the reactor behaved in a regular and predictable manner
and that the reactivity balance is a valuable tool in
performing nuclear operatlons analyms for molten-sa]t
reactors

3.1 FREEZE-FLANGE THERMAL-CYCLE TEST
- F.E.Lynch

Thermal cyclmg of the freeze ﬂange was continued
through cycle 470 before it was shut down for a

scheduled inspection and minor repairs. Operation of -

the test was resumed at cycle 471 and continued
through cycle 540, when thermal cycling of the flange
was discontinued as scheduted. Visual inspection of the

‘flange exterior during and at the end of each cycle

revealed no indication of thermal fatigue cracks. There
were, however, the usual minor operation problems
experienced during this period of operation. These
operation problems and the results of the flange

" inspection after cycle 470 are reported below.

3.1.1 Facility Operation Problems

Downtime during both these periods of operation

(cycles 401-470 and 471-540) was due to burned-out

test section heaters. All minor operation problems, such
as plugged vent lines and instrument troubles, were
corrected during or at the end of the oscillation time.
Burned-out heaters in both test section heater boxes
resulted in all the downtime during the first period
(cycles 401—470). Replacement of the test section
heaters adjacent to the female flange resulted in the
downtime during the last period of operation.

3.1.2 InSpectlon of the Flanges

The flange clamps were: removed at the end of cycle
470 without any difficulty. The flanges were opened
for inspection, and the oval ring gasket with stainless
steel insert screen was removed for inspection. The
average outer diameter of the frozen salt cake on the
screen was 10 in. This was _approximately the same
outer diameter as in all previous inspections except for
cycle 103, when it was 11% in.-

Inspection of the inner flange face and the bore of
both flanges was again made with a fluorescent dye
penetrant (Zyglo type ZL-22 penetrant with developer
type ZP-9). As in previous inspections, the female
flange face and bore were free of cracks. In the male
flange the face and neck remained free of cracks or
porosity indications, but as before there were indica-
tions in the bore in the vicinity of the weld attaching
the alignment stub to the face of the flange."! Figure 3.1
is a photograph showing the fluorescent indication of a
crack at the base of the stub and a porosity band
extending clockwise around the bore from the upper
thermocouple. A dashed cracklike indication at a -
position 1% in. from the end of the stub started at the
upper bore thermocouple and extended circumferen-
tially to approximately 15°. From this point around to
60° the cracklike pattern indication was continuous,
with a dashed cracklike pattern continuing around to
120°, A porosity band extended 1 in. farther into the
bore and continued around to 120° before necking
down to %, in. width that continued around to 155°.
Figure 3.2 shows a similar porosity band extended
counterclockwise from the upper bore thermocouple
around to 155°. From 15° counterclockwise around to
45° there was very little porosity indication.

Comparison of these photographs with those taken of
the same locations after cycle 400 (Figs. 3.1 and 3.2 of
ref, 2) showed that there was less apparent porosity in
the later inspection. This apparent anomaly was attrib-
uted to differences in the cleaning procedure used to
remove salt from the bore before it was inspected with
the dye penetrant. (All trace of salt must be removed
from the bore or it will absorb the dye and indicate
porosity-type cracks.) The cleaning was more vigorous
after cycle 470, when aluminum oxide cloth bands (180

grit) were used on a small pneumatic rotary grinder to
clean the bore. The ability to remove or obliterate the
cracklike indication and the porosity indications could
be evidence that these indications were not as deep as
they had first appeared. Thus plans were made to make
an effort in the final inspection to clean the surface by

removing a very small amount of metal. The results will

be photographed, and differences in the cracklike
pattern noted. An effort will then be made to remove a
portion of the cracklike pattern by grinding approxi-
mately 0,002 in. from the bore of the male flange in an
area where the depth of the cracklike pattern is
greatest.

During the first four months of this report period,
partial plugging was experienced about twice weekly in

found to be nearly full of salt aerosols (15 p diameter
or less) and was replaced with a new filter. During the

plug although salt aerosols again began to build up in

the filter.

3.3 DEVELOPMENT OF ANALYTICAL MODEL FOR
135 Xe POISONING IN THE MSRE

“R.J.Kedl

In 1967 an analytical model was developed to
calculate !'35Xe reactivity effects in the MSRE. This
model was based on conventional mass transfer phe-
nomena, including effects of circulating bubbles of
cover gas, which it treated as practically insoluble. This
model predicted that the '3%Xe poisoning would
decrease monotonically as the void fraction of bubbles
increased. The data on xenon poisoning as a function of
void fraction obtained in this report period (Sect. 1.2.2)
showed the predicted kind of behavior when the cover
gas was argon but not when it was helium. With helium
cover gas, the Xxenon poisoning passed through a
maximum at a core void fraction of about 0.25%.

‘The reason for the maximum in the experimental data
with helium cover gas is thought to be associated with
helium bubbles going into solution at the pump
discharge and renucleating further around the fuel loop
as the fluid static pressure is reduced. Apparently this

renucleation is accompanied by gross removal of '35Xe

from solution. Argon is an order of magnitude less
soluble in fuel salt than helium; therefore one would
expect the bubble dissolution and renucleation effects

to be reduced and the argon data to be in better.

agreement with the analytical model. To check this
idea, 135Xe steady-state reactivities were recomputed
with this model and the best available estimates of
bubble parameters for comparison with the helium and
argon data to see if any conclusions could be reached.
~ The bubble parameters which were used are shown in

Table 3.1. The reasoning behind the choice is as

37

follows. It is generally thought that the circulating
bubbles ‘in ‘the MSRE are very small, with estimates
ranging from 0.001 to 0.010 in. The void fraction in the
reactor was obtained by changing the pump speed. As
the flow rate goes up, yielding a higher void fraction,
one would expect that larger bubbles are carried under
into the fuel loop. Table 3.1 then shows the bubble
- diameter changing from 0 to 0.010 in. incrementally as
the loop void fraction goes from O to 1%. An average
bubble diameter is chosen for each increment of void
fraction. In a gravity field of unity, the terminal rising
velocity of a 0.001-in. bubble in the fuel salt is about
0.004 in./sec, and it is 0.4 in./sec for a 0.010-in. bubble.
Obviously the 0.001-in. bubbles will travel “with the
- salt”; that is, they will remain with the fuel as it is
sprayed through the pump bowl and eventually reenters
the loop. The bubble-stripping efficiency for these
bubbles ought to be close to zero. The bubble-stripping
efficiency will increase rapidly as the bubble size
increases because in this range (Stokes range) the
bubble rising velocity increases as the square of the
bubble diameter. Table 3.1 also shows the bubble-
stripping efficiency changing from 0 to 20% incre-
mentally as the loop void fraction goes from 0 to 1%.
An average bubble-stripping efficiency is chosen for
each increment of void fraction. To illustrate, when the
void fraction is in the range of 0 to 0.1%, the bubble
diameter is 0.0005 in. and the bubble-stripping effi-
ciency is 1%. When the void fraction is in the range of
0.1 to 0.2%, the first 0.1% is the previous bubbles, and
that above 0.1% is composed of new bubbles of
diameter 0.0015 in. and stripping efficiency 3%. The
progression continues to the last range of 0.9 to 1.0%
void fraction, which is composed of the previous nine
ranges plus new bubbles of diameter 0.0095 in. and
stripping efficiency 19%. Similar progressions with
different sized efficiency increments were used to
establish bubble parameters for other maximum values
of stripping efficiency. '

Poisoning.

The results of the calculation with these bubble
parameters at maximum stripping efficiencies of 20 and

~ 40% are the curves in Fig. 3.3, A simplified calcula-

tional method was used in which all core parameters
were volume averaged into one lump. The reactivity was
computed by first computing the poison fraction,
multiplying it by a constant (0.656) to convert it to
reactivity units, and then by a spatial correction factor
(0.81) on the graphite contribution because its !35Xe
concentration profile is dish-shaped due to burnup.

38

First consider the right side of the plot. The curves
calculated with bubble-stripping efficiency ranges of O .
to 20% and O to 40% straddle the data points, At higher
void fractions one would expect bubble dissolution and
renucleation effects to diminish so the original ana-
lytical model (insoluble cover gas) should converge with

- any new analysis where the solubility of the cover gas is

considered. The good agreement between the analytical
model and the data with “reasonable™ values of bubble
parameters would seem to bear this out.

Now consider the left side of the plot. The computed
intercept with the ordinate could be brought down to

. the argon data point (void fraction = 0%) by using a

mass transfer coefficient to the graphite of half the

originally estimated value. There is some indirect
evidence from work with noble metal migration to

~ graphite that the mass transfer coefficient should be

Iower. If we assume, however, that the mass transfer
coefficient to the graphite is correct, then another
observation can be made. This is that the points of
intersection with the axis increase as the cover gas
solubility decreases: they are about 0.25% &k/k for
helium (soluble), about 0.85% 8k/k for argon (much less
soluble), and about 1.12% 8k/k for the analytical model

- (insoluble). This observation would lend support to the

thesis that cover gas solubility is an important param-
eter at low void fractions in the fuel loop.

4 2 CONTROL SYSTEM DESIGN
P.G. Hemdon |

The fuel off-gas system was revised to mcorporate an

" apparatus set up in the vent house to collect tritium
from the gaseous effluent streams. Sample lines were

connected from the apparatus to.the fuel and coolant
salt off-gas lines, to the containment evacuation line,
and to a sleeve on a tube in the coolant radiator (Sect.
1.2.5). Purge gas was supplied to this apparatus from

high-pressure cylinders equipped with series-connected

pressure regulators, rupture disks, and high-pressure
alarms to assure that the reactor system would not be
subjected to pressures in excess of 50 psig. One new
safety block valve was connected to existing circuits,
and all other lines were connected so as to take
advantage of existing block valves without com-
promising the integrity of the primary and secondary
containment systems.

Design of safety circuits for another system, a new
off-gas sample line from line 522 near the pump bowl

to the fuel sampler-enricher container, was completed,

but the line was not installed before the final shutdown.
Three small weldsealed valves were fitted with pneu-
matic actuators for use in this system. The actuators
were to be supplied by three-way solenoid valves which
were added to the vacuum system circuits.

Plans for setting up the instruments and controls to
- adequately maintain and monitor reactor conditions

during the shutdown period were also completed.

4.3 MSRE ON-LINE COMPUTER
C. D, Martin, Jr.

Operation and analysis of the MSRE was facilitated
-by the use of a Bunker-Ramo 340 digital computer
- connected direcily to sensors in the MSRE system. The
~ computer main frame included 12,288 28-bit words of

core memory and 32,768 words of drum memory with
a 7.5usec core cycle time. Peripheral equipment in-

- cluded 350 analog inputs, 128 contact inputs, 36 analog

outputs, 32 contact outputs, 2 magnetic tape units, an
input keyboard, a paper tape punch, a paper tape
reader, 4 output typewriters, and an x-y plotter. The
system was installed in the summer of 1965 and was
accepted on October 1, 1965 (before the beginning of

MSRE power operation), Over the next 51 months,

untii January 1, 1970, the computer system was
available 95.35% of the time.

During this report period the neutron noise analysis
program was extensively modified to make it run as an
ondine operator request. The previous version of the
program required taking the computer offdine to
acquire the data.and record it on magnetic tape. The
data were then read back into the computer for
processing ondine as a background operation with the
reactor monitoring system running in the foreground.
The new program eliminated the recording of data on
magnetic tape. When this program is requested, the
reactor monitoring system is preempted for a period of
10 min, during which time data are acquired and stored
in the computer memory. Calculations are made as
sufficient data are accumulated. The use of two data
buffers permits the functions of data acquisition and
processing to proceed concurrently. The reactor moni-
toring system is automatically reinstated upon com-
pletion of the noise analysis calculation, and the results
of the calculation are plotted ondine as a background

.. function producing the familiar graph of power spectral
- density. The void fraction is calculated for the fuel salt

using the results of the noise analysis calculation. This -
value is printed on the control room typewriter. -
‘Following the reactor shutdown in December 1969,
the ondine reactor monitoring system was revised. The
new system exercises all units of the computer periodi-

“cally except for the magnetic tape drives and three of

the four typewriters. FOCAL is still available for
engineering calculations using the input keyboard and
console typewriter, and analog signals can be displayed
on the digital display of the computer console.

The company-owned magnetic drum memory unit
was refurbished at the manufacturer’s plant and was
reinstalled in the computer in January. While the drum
was being reworked, system operation was maintained
using a drum leased from the computer manufacturer.

Part 2. MSBR Design and Develp'_pment

 

- .S

 

The purpose of the MSBR design and development

activities is to prepare a reference design for a
1000-Mw(e) one-fluid MSBR plant; to design a molten-
salt breeder experiment (MSBE), operation of which
will provide the data and experience necessary to build
large MSBR’s; and to develop the components and
systems for the MSBE. '

Work on the reference design for the one-fluid MSBR
~ was begun in October 1967 and has taken most of the
effort. Prior progress is reported in our semiannual
reports for the periods ending in February and August

1968 and 1969. The studies have converged on a design, .

and some of the more important details have been
investigated. Writing is in progress on a topical report
that will describe the plant and the results of the studies
in considerable detail. Some studies are being made of
‘molten-salt power reactors that would have lower
performance but would require less development and
could be built sooner than the reference MSBR. _

With the general design of the reference MSBR
reasonably well established, we have begun to look at
the MSBE, Calculations indicate that a reactor with a
power level of 100 to 200 Mw(th) can satisfy the

requirements that have been proposed to date. A small
effort is being spent on preliminary studies of reactor
designs and on nuclear calculations.

The development program is small, and the experi-
mental work is limited to some of the most important
problems. Work is being done on methods of dispersing
bubbles of gas in and separating them from circulating
liquids. Experiments are in progress to measure the
coefficients for transfer of dissolved gas to bubbles in
circulating liquids. These experiments are in support of
the gaseous fission product removal system.

Better values are being obtained for the thermal
conductivities of salts for use in heat transfer calcula-
tions. Experiments are in progress to confirm or
improve on the relationships used to calculate heat
transfer coefficients for molten fluoride salts. The
sodium fluoroborate—sodium fluoride eutectic salt has,

‘because of its low melting point and low cost, been

proposed for use in the intermediate coolant systems of
large molten-salt reactors. Since this is a new salt to the
MSR program, a forced convection loop is being
operated in engineering tests with the salt.

5.2 MSBR PRIMARY SALT STORAGE TANK
E.S.Bettis H.L.Watts

The only significant change in the single-fluid MSBR
reference design since last reported® has been the
addition of a primary salt storage tank. This tank would
‘be used to store the primary salt in event of the need to
repair the primary drain tank or its heat removal
system. . The storage tank is located in the chemical
processing cell. After insertion of a spool piece in the
transfer line, the salt would be moved to the storage
tank by a jet pump located in the bottom of the
primary drain tank. The spool-piece arrangement is used
to provide assurance that the salt could not be
transferred inadvertently. The salt is returned to the
primary drain tank by a similar jet pump located in the
bottom of the storage tank. Both jet pumps are
actuated by a small auxiliary salt circulation pump. The

storage tank has only about 1 Mw of heat removal

5.3 STARTUP AND SHUTDOWN PROCEDURES
E.C. Hise S.J.Ditto  J. L. Anderson

Preliminary studies were made of the startup and
shutdown procedures for the MSBR reference plant to
be sure that these special conditions, as well as those for
partial load operation, would not add undue operating
complexity or require an unreasonable amount of
special equipment. A preliminary flowsheet developed
for these special situations is shown in Fig, 5.1,

thermal power station, the ability to hold the system in
hot standby and to achieve quick starts from this
condition is imperative to avoid excessive outage times
for the plant. -

Cold Start. — A normal startup from the cold-empty
condition proceeds as follows: The primary and second-
ary cell electric heaters are turned on, and the primary
and secondary salt circulation pumps are started to
circulate helium in the salt systems. When the tempera-
ture of the secondary system reaches 850°F, the loops
are filled with secondary salt from the heated drain
tank, and circulation of salt is started. When the
primary and secondary systems reach 1000°F, the
primary system is filled from the primary-salt drain
tank, and circulation of salt is commenced. Both salt
systems confinue to circulate isothermally at 1000°F
until power escalation is started. The primary and
secondary salt flow rates are at the levels required for
the lower end of the power range.

The reactor is made critical at essentially zero power
using standard flux control methods. This operation
requires removal of safety rods and further addition of
reactivity by insertion of graphite control rods under

the surveillance of startup instrumentation and a flux -

level control system. When the power reaches an
appropriate level, which is still below the sensible power
generating range, the automatic neutron flux level
controller assumes control of the power.

Concurrently with the salt systems being electrically
heated, the steam system is being warmed and brought
to operating conditions by means of an oil- or gas-fired
auxiliary boiler. Deaeration and demineralization of the
feedwater and warmup of piping, feedwater heaters,
turbines, etc., proceed in a conventional manner with
steam taken from this boiler. To avoid excessive
thermal gradients in the steam generators, steam that is

admitted must be nearly at full operating conditions of

3600 psia and 1000°F. As the auxiliary boiler is being
raised to this pressure, steam from it is throttled
through the boiler extraction valve BE, is passed
-.through the . desuperheater DSH, and is used. for
feedwater heating, for warming and rolling the boiler
feed pump drive turbines BFP-T and for warming the
. high-pressure feedwater heaters. When the auxiliary
boiler reaches full pressure and temperature, circulation
can be started through the steam generator.

When the steam system is ready to begin to take on
load, the set point of the flux controller is adjusted as

47

As the steam load is slowly increased, the reactor power
is matched to the load, and salt temperatures are kept
at the desired level by manipulating the flux set point,.
At 2 to 10% power, temperature changes are slow, and
such control should not be difficult. When the load

- reaches 800,000 Ib/hr, or about 8 to 10% of full load,

the reactor can be put in a temperature control mode
instead of a flux control mode after matching the
temperature set point with the existing outlet tempera-
ture. The load should be held essentially constant until
the system comes to equilibrium, and then the reactor
outlet temperature set point should be adjusted to meet
the requirements for subsequent load-following control.
The boiler feedwater pressure booster pumps FBP can
then be started to raise the steam generator inlet
pressure to about 3800 psia, and the auxiliary boiler
and its feedwater pump can be taken off the line. The

- system is now self-supporting at about 8% load.

Part of the steam generator output flows to the mixer
M via the reheat steam preheater, and the remainder
passes through the boiler extraction valve BE to drive
the main boiler feed pumps, etc. The main turbines,
which have previously been warmed as mentioned
above, are now gradually brought up to speed and
temperature, using steam from the hot standby equip-
ment at first and then steam taken directly from the
steam generators. |
. The load is then increased to 20%, at which time the
steam temperature controller is activated. At this power
level the “normal” control system regulates steam
temperature and reactor outlet temperature as func-
tions of load. To prevent undesirable transients, the
various system parameters and set points should be
adjusted to the requirements of the existing power
demand prior to closing the fully automatic loop.

The precise conditions at which the various steps of
the program are taken, as well as the rates of change of
the different variables during the startup, must be
determined by analyses of the complete plant. The
extent of the present study is limited and is only

- intended to establish feasibility, Given consistent and

-acceptable steady-state (or quasi-steady-state) condi-

tions for the startup operations, it appears that the plan

‘described can be implemented using already demon-

required to maintain the desired salt temperatures as -

the feedwater flow is increased. The feedwater tempera-
ture to the steam generator is reduced by tempering the

- ~ feed steam with 550°F water in the mixing chamber M.

strated techniques of controlling the MSRE.

“Hot Standby and Startup. — On reduction of the
main turbine load and closure of the stop valve SV,
steam will be immediately let down through the boiler
extraction valve BE, through the desuperheater and
heat rejection valve HRTV, and thence to the main
turbine condenser. Except for extreme situations of
sudden loss of turbine load, and possibly not then, the

 
 

 

boiler pressure relief valves need not vent steam to the
atmosphere.

A portion of the steam from the steam generator can
be used to drive the boiler feed pump turbine BFP-T

48

and to continue circulation of the feedwater to the

steam generators for heat removal and rejection to the

turbine condensers. Another portion of the steam will

continue to drive the standby steam turbine-generator
set to supply standby power (if not available from the
grid through the station service transformer) to drive
the salt circulation pumps, some of the main con-

densing water supply pumps and hot well, pressure .

booster, and other pumps required to maintain the
feedwater system operative. -

Afterheat from the reactor system will continue to be
transferred to the steam system and maintain it at
~ operating temperature - for several hours, depending
upon the burden of fission products in the system. As
this heat source decays, the auxiliary boiler can be
started if it is desired to maintain the system in the hot
standby condition. The time required for restart from
this mode, as described above, would be limited only by
the acceptable rate of temperature rise in the main
turbines, as in a conventional steam system.

5.3.2 Normal Shutdown

A normal shutdown proceeds as follows: The system
power is reduced under control of the operating circuits
until\about 8% of full load power is reached. As
outlined above, the hot standby condition is reached by
gradually reducing the flow to the main turbines to zero
and at the same time transferring the generated steam
to the hot standby system through the boiler extraction

5.4 DESIGNS FOR FIRST-GENERATION
MOLTEN-SALT POWER REACTORS

E.S.Bettis  H. L. Watts

~ 5.4.1 General

The molten-salt reactor design effort to date has
concentrated on developing a concept with the highest
performance consistent with a feasible and practical
design. As discussed in a previous report,? the criterion
for performance was taken to be the combination of

‘breeding gain and salt inventory requirement that

would result in- best utilization of the nation’s fissile
fuel resources. However, if breeding capability is given
reduced emphasis and higher priority is given to
simplifying the plant and its operation, other designs of
molten-salt reactor plants would result. Some of these
would be more immediately realizable with less de-

- velopment, since they would be similar to scaled-up

valve BE and thence to the turbine condenser, as |

required. If it is desired to stay in the hot standby
condition, the auxiliary boiler can be started; if not, the
main turbine can be allowed to cool, the rate being
_ controlled by admitting some steam from the steam
- dryer SD through the turbine seals and warmup system.
Feedwater will continue to be supplied to as many of
the steam generators as required (probably one or two)
to remove reactor afterheat and to maintain the desired
salt temperature profiles. After about ten days of
afterheat removal (depending on the operating history
of the reactor), the primary salt can be transferred to
the drain tank, where the heat rejection system for that
tank will continue to dissipate the heat. Cell heaters will
- pick up the load to maintain the secondary salt in the
molten condition until it is drained. With termination

versions of the MSRE, which accumulated several years
of successful operating experience. Although the simpli-
fied plants would not have as high a performance as
breeders (when processing methods are successfully
developed), they would, as converters, have high con-
version ratios, and the fuel cycle costs would be low
enough to compete favorably with other converter
reactors. Further, these molten-salt converter reactors
would be able to use either 235U or Pu as fissile fuel
makeup with about the same low fuel cost.

Design and operation of these simplified plants would
not represent a diversion from the main goal of

achieving a molten-salt breeder reactor having good fuel

conservation properties. They would, rather, be an
intermediate step, yielding valuable experience directly
applicable to the high-performance breeders to follow.

Simplification of molten-salt reactor plants can be
achieved in two important areas: (1) The complexity of

the “processing of the primary salt can be greatly =
reduced if the treatment consists simply in recovery of

the uranium by fluoride volatility, a process which is

“already relatively well developed. The carrier salt would
be discarded after it became too contaminated with

fission products for economical operation. (2) Use of
lower power density within the reactor core would

‘provide a core graphite life equal to that of the rest of

the plant. Elimination of the need for periodic graphite
replacement would simplify the reactor design, greatly

reduce the amount of special equipment needed for

- core maintenance, and moderate the risks and nuisances

of all steam generation, the steam system can be

allowed to cool.

involved in disposal of a series of spent reactor core
assemblies.

To date, we have bnefly considered two single-fluid
molten-salt reactor concepts for use in such power
plants. The reactor designs are discussed here; the
nuclear characteristics and fuel cycle performance are
reported in Sect. 6.1.2.

5.4.2 Large MSRE-Type Reactor

We began our investigation of these reactors by

instructing the ROD computer code to optimize on the
conservation coefficient that has been used previously
in molten-salt reactor studies but to limit the peak flux
" to a value such that the damage fluence to the graphite
would not exceed 3.2 X 10%? neutrons/cm? in 30
years, This resulted in a reactor with a cylindrical core
about 26 ft in diameter by 26 ft high. Although the
core is much larger than the core of the reference
design, replacement of the graphite would not be
necessary, and the reactor vessel could be a cylinder
with dished heads welded at top and bottom. As shown
in Table 6.2, the reactor could be operated as a
converter with only fluoride volatility processing of the

49

As shown in Fig. 5.3, the top grid is made up of
l-in.-thick graphite plates. The top 4-in. length of each

" prism is turned to a diameter of 2 in. to fit into holes in

the plates. Each of the principal plates has 16 holes. At

" the points where the corners of four 16-element groups
‘meet, a smaller *5-in-thick graphite plate with four

fuel or as a breeder with complete fuel processing and

with little difference in estimated fuel cycle cost. The
increased core life is, however, obtained at the expense

of an increase in inventory of fissionable material over

the reference design and a reduction in fuel yield when

. operated as a breeder.

A conceptual layout of the reactor vessel is shown in
Fig. 5.2. The similarity to the MSRE core is evident.
The vertical graphite prisms constituting the core have a
4-in.-square cross section and have a central hole as well

as milled flow passages in the four faces to provide

channels for flow of salt upward through the core. The
holes would be of different diameters, and the depth of

holes is placed over the corner prism in each group to
tie the four groups together. These smaller tie plates
have standoff dowels to hold them away from the top
reflector to provide a flow passage for the salt.

The elements are positioned at the bottom of the core
by graphite slabs arranged in egg-crate fashion, as shown
in Fig. 5.4. The grid is arranged into squares, each
accommodating 25 elements. By indexing the elements
in groups of 25 at the bottom and in groups of 16 at
the top, the position of the core graphite is stabilized,
and gap distances cannot accumulate. The prisms are
thus restrained in the radial direction but can move
axially with temperature and radiation-induced dimen-
sional changes. '

A 2%-ft-thick reflector is provided around the core
for better neutron economy and to protect the vessel
wall from radiation damage. The reflector is made up of
large pieces of graphite which have salt flow passages to
provide the necessary cooling. The graphite core ele-
ments normally float in the fuel salt. When the reactor

is empty of salt, the elements rest on the bottom

reflector.

A possible major shortcoming of this design is the
26-ft length of the core elements. Difficulty could be
encountered with impregnation of the graphite surface

- inside the central hole, and this would permit per-

the passages on the faces would be varied, dependingon
‘the distance from the center of the core, to provide
three different regions of salt-to-graphxte ratio as

indicated in Table 6.2. :
Each of the graphite prisms in the core must be

meation of the graphite by '*°Xe and increased
neutron losses. Also, elements of this length pose

fabrication and handling problems.

5.4.3 Spherical Reactor with Graphite Ball Bed

Procurement of graphite for a molten-salt reactor

: would be greatly simplified if graphite spheres were

constrained to a definite position with relation to other -

elements in order to preserve the desired flow distri-
bution. This is necessary because the temperature
-coefficient of expansion of Hastelloy N is greater than
that of graphite, which would tend to cause a tightly
assembled unconstrained core to become loose when
the system is brought up to temperature. Further,
radiation-induced damage causes the graphite to shrink
over certain ranges of neutron fluence. An indexing grid
for the elements is therefore used at the top and
bottom of the core.

used as the moderator. We accordingly made a study of

a spherical reactor vessel containing 6-in.-diam graphite
balls. As may be noted in Table 6.2, however, the

salt-to-graphite ratio in this type of core is about 0,37, a
salt fraction too high to be economical when the core is

- made large enough to obtain the low power density

needed for long graphite life. Since this is true, the
computer code was allowed to optimize fuel costs as a
function of the reactor core diameter. On this basis a
core diameter of 19 ft resulted, but the estimated core
graphite life is only about 9 years. A conceptual
drawing of this reactor type is shown in Fig. 5.5.

‘While -the moderator graphite in this concept has to
be changed probably twice during the life of the plant,
it may be easier to design a maintenance system to
handle the small spheres rather than the long prisms.
One way of changing the spheres might employ a
release gate above the salt-liquid level in the reactor
which would utilize the buoyancy of the graphite to
force out a sphere in an inversion of the method used in
the German pebble-bed reactor. Batch removal could be
effected by an unloading mechanism operating through
a relatively small opening at the top of the vessel.

This molten-salt reactor concept has not received
extensive study but appears to have interesting possi-
bilities for development into a practical reactor.

5.5 BAYONET-TUBE HEAT EXCHANGERS

- C.E.Bettis -

Molten-salt breeder reactors must be designed to
minimize fuel salt volume in order to attain a good
doubling time. The primary heat exchangers which have
been designed to date for the molten-salt breeder
concepts have been shell-and-tube types which use small
tubes to carry the primary salt and are baffled to
improve cross flow of secondary salt on the shell side.
The only method considered practical for maintenance
of such exchangers is to replace the tube bundle if a
leak occurs.

In order to make pluggmg of individual tubes possi-

ble, a different primary heat exchanger concept has

been devised which uses a central tube and an inner

annulus for secondary salt and an outer annulus for
primary salt. As shown in Fig. 5.6, each concentric tube
assembly becomes a separate heat exchanger in which
one can conceivably detect a leak and plug the
assembly.
~ Since the maintenance possibilities are attractive,
several exchangers of different sizes have been analyzed
to see what size, shape, volume, etc., would be
necessary to enable such an exchanger to be substituted
for the primary heat exchanger of the MSBR reference
design.

A computer program was written to make the
calculations. It determines the tube length and associ-

53

ated parameters for a given configuration, pressure --

drops, and number of tubes. The wall thickness of the

tubes is adjusted to withstand the maximum pressures

encountered. The log mean temperature difference

allows for heat transfer to the coolant salt in the inner

tube.

Table 5.2 compares the reference design MSBR
primary heat exchanger with the reentrant tube ex-
changer designed for similar conditions.

S, 6 DISTRIBUTION OF TRITIUM IN AN MSBR
R. B. Briggs

A 1000-Mw(e) MSBR that operates at 2250 Mw(th)
will produce tritium at a rate of 2420 cunes per
full-power day. The sources of productlon are:*

The radiation emitted by tritium is low in energy
(18.6-kev beta), and the hazard is small in comparison

.with the hazard of most fission products. Tritium does,

however, exchange with the normal hydrogen in
hydrogenous compounds, and once it is released it
becomes a part of the hydrogen of all living things
about in proportion to its fraction of the hydrogen in
water in the surroundings.

In these preliminary calculations of the distribution in

the MSBR reference design, we-assumed that tritium,
shortly after birth, will be present as molecules of
tritium gas (T, ) or tritium fluoride gas (TF) dissolved in
the primary salt. The relative amounts of T, and TF
will depend on the reducing power (the ratio of the

concentration of UF; to that of UF, in the primary

salt). The fraction of . tritium present as T, would
increase with increasing UF3/UF,;.

T, and TF in the fuel salt were assumed to diffuse to
the helium bubbles that are provided to remove gaseous
fission products and to be removed with the helium to
the off-gas system. They were also assumed to diffuse
to metal and graphite surfaces. At the metal surfaces

the T, could dissociate into tritium atoms, dissolve in

the metal, and diffuse through the metal walls. The TF

could react with the metal wall to liberate tritium

atoms, but we assumed that the reaction rate _of TF
with the metal would be slow in comparison with the
dissociation rate of T, and that none of the tritium in

- TF would be available to diffuse through the walls. This

assumption tends to give low results for the amount of
tritium that would reach the steam system.

The gas that diffuses to the graphite would reach a
steady concentration in the pores that would be
proportional to the concentration in the salt, or it
would react with the graphite to form methane or other
hydrocarbons that could not diffuse through metal and

would be removed in the helium bubbles. Neglect of
~ these reactions tends to give high results for the amount

of tritium that would reach the steam system.. _
The tritium that passes through the walls of the
piping and reactor vessel would be contained by the

reactor cell, and that which passes through the heat

exchanger tubing would enter the secondary salt. In the
secondary system, tr1t1um was assumed to be present
only as T,; no reactlons Wlth the salt were consxdered

For purposes of these calculations, we assumed that
helium bubbles could be injected into the secondary
salt and removed to an off-gas system as in the primary
system. Some of the T, would enter the bubbles, and
the remainder would diffuse to metal surfaces, dissoci-
ate, and diffuse through the metal. In the secondary

~ system, tritium that -passes through the pipe walls

would be contained in the secondary system cell.
However, tritium that passes through the walls of the
tubes in the steam generators, superheaters, and re-
heaters would exchange with hydrogen in the steam. If
most of the tritium were to reach the steam, it would
give rise to major problems in operatmg the plant and
disposing of the tritium. -

The calculations were made by use of the usual mass
transfer and diffusion relationships. For transport
through the salt to metal, graphite, or bubble surfaces,

Q= kA(C, — Cy),

where, in consistent units,
Q = net tra_nsbort rate,
k= mass transfer coefficient,
A =surface area‘, )
C,, = concentration of T, or TF in bulk salt,

Cg = concentration of T, or TF in salt at surface.

For diffusion through the metal walls,

Q——(P"2 -p;*),

where
- P = penetration coefficient for the metal,
t = thickness of the metal,

p; = partial pressure of Tz at the mner surface of the
~ metal,

p,, = partial pressure of T, at the outer surface of the
metal.

For all the calculations the concentration of tritium in

* the salt at the surfaces was assumed to be in equilibrium

with the concentration in the gas in the bubbles or on
the metal surface, so p = HCg, where H is the solubility

- coefficient (or Henry’s law constant) that relates the

concentration of T, in the salt to its partial pressure.
Calculations were run for a variety of conditions. The

first were for conditions generally typical of the MSBR

reference design. Those conditions were then modified -

hydrogen (supplied in the helium purge) to the primary
salt at rates 10? to 10® times the tritium generation
rate and of coating the heat exchanger and steam
generator, superheater, and reheater tubing to increase
the resistance (decrease the permeation coefficient) by

into the steam system, 18% to diffuse through the -

primary off-gas system in the helium bubbles. In-
creasing the helium purge rate in the primary system to

the secondary system reduced the amount of tritium
reaching the steam to 28% of the production. The
amount entering the cell was reduced in about the same
proportion. The effect of adding hydrogen to the

added to salt at rates 10% to 10° times the Ty production rate.
 

reference design was to increase the amount of T,
reaching the steam system until the ratio H,/T,
exceeded 10%. This is because addition of hydrogen
results in an increase in the hydrogen concentration in
the salt, a decrease in the ratio HF/H, in the salt,.and a

57

decrease in the fraction of tritium that is present as TF. .
This makes a larger fraction of the tritium available as

HT, a form that can dissociate and diffuse through the

walls, Increasing UF3 /UF,4 had the same effect.
Increasing the hydrogen addition rate to 10® times

the rate of tritium production resulted in only 4%

of the tritium reaching the steam system and 95% being

removed by the purge systems. This amount of dilution

of the tritium by hydrogen is probably excessive and

would create problems of handling and storage.

In the absence of added hydrogen the partial pressure
of hydrogen (as tritium) in equilibrium with its con-
centration in the primary salt is 107 to 10™* torr. At
this. low pressure the salt films provide much more
resistance to transport of tritium than do the metal
walls. Increasing the resistance of the tube walls in the
steam generating equipment and in the primary heat
exchangers by factors up to 100 had no useful effect.
With the tube wall resistances increased by a factor of
1000 and with maximum purge rates in primary and
secondary systems, the transport to the steam system
was reduced to less than 5% of the production.

It is desirable to reduce the amount of tritium that
enters the steam system to 1% or less of the production.
The calculations indicated that this could be accom-
plished by increasing the tube wall resistances by a
factor of 100 and adding hydrogen to the primary

‘system at a rate near 10° times the production rate of
the tritium. Under these conditions the UF3/UF; in the
primary salt is unimportant. Gas purge is required in the

reactor primary and secondary system, but the purge

rates need not be as great as 100 cfm.

Use of tungsten or' ceramic coatings on tubes in the
steam generating equipment and in the primary heat
exchangers and use of high purge gas flows in the
primary and secondary salt systems can be expected to
increase significantly the cost and complexity of an
MSBR -The requlrement to add hydrogen to the

primary system is an additional but less expensive
complication. We believe that the calculations reported
here are conservative, and factors that were not
considered could considerably reduce the measures
necessary to prevent excessive amourits of tritium from
reaching the steam system. They include the following:

1. Some data indicate that the diffusion of hydrogen
through Hastelloy N at 1200 to 1500°F deviates
from the relationship

Q/A =Mp'/?

at pressures below about 10 torrs and is better
described by an equation of the form

Q/A =Mp‘72 [Np" /(1 + Np™)]

where %, < | < 1. This relatlonslup implies a higher
resistance - to d1ffus1on 'of hydrogen through the
metal than was used in our calculations.

. The sodium fluoroborate salt contains hydrogen in
hydroxyfluoroboric acid or some other as yet
undetermined form. Tritium can be expected to
exchange with that hydrogen and to be removable
by processing the salt. :

. Data from the MSRE suggest that the exchange of
tritium for hydrogen in small amounts of methane
added to the helium purge gas could considerably
increase the rate of removal of tritium by the purge
gas in the primary system.

4. Preliminary calculations indicate that use of the
bayonet-tube-type primary heat exchanger (see Sect.
5.5) in the MSBR reference design would reduce the
amount of tritium reaching the steam system from
69% to about 9% of the production without any
other provisions, This is because most of the tritium
diffuses through the large surface area provided by
the outer tubes that separate fuel salt from the gas

- space in the exchangers.

- We plan to study the effects of these factors, but new
experimental data are required for some before much
more progress can be made in the calculations.

6.1 PHYSICS ANALYSIS OF MSBR
'6.1.1 Single-Fluid MSBR Reference Design
H. F. Bauman |

The nuclear data for the single-fluid MSBR reference
design have been reported in previous semiannual
reports.!»> However, we have made a new calculation

of the MSBR reference design in order to take

advantage of some improved capabilities in the ROD
code and to make use of the latest available data.

The processing section of ROD was expanded so that
it can now completely describe a processing scheme
with up to ten processing steps. A cost (dependent on

the throughput) may be assigned to any or all steps.In

addition, the complete fuel cycle cost section of ROD is
now operational.
The new reference calculatxon (CC120) dxffers from

the previous calculation (CC58) as follows:

1. It follows in detail the reference reductlve‘extraction
processing scheme (see part B of Table 6.1).

2. It includes the fuel cycle costs based on the latest
material costs® and a preliminary estimate of the
- probable processing cost.
3. It includes a calculation of replacement cost for the
core graphlte .
4. The reference 7 Li enrichment in fresh makeup salt is

99.995%, whereas in CC58 a value of 99.9988% had
madvertently been selected.

5. The plutomum nuclides are mc!uded exphc:tly in
the nuclear calculation, :

6.7 It uses the latest cross-section weighting emplbying
the nuclide concentrations from CC58 and the latest
est:mate of the average temperature

The results of the new calculation are g:ven in Table'
6.1. The indicated performance is not much different

‘from the earlier calculation. The breeding ratio is about

the same, the fissile inventory is about 2% greater, and
the peak power density is 8% greater.
MSBR Processing Rate, — The MSBR reference design

. was calculated for fixed processing rates corresponding

to a three-day protactinium removal cycle and a 50-day
rare-earth removal cycle, The optimum processing rates
cannot be determined until the processing steps and
their costs are further developed, but we have studied =
the effect of processing rate on the performance of the
reference MSBR.

The effect of processing rate on the conversion  ratio
is shown in-Fig. 61. The 3000-day protactinium cycle
time curve is essentially the no-protactinium-removal
case. Without protactinium removal the reference

- MSBR is at best a break-even breeder. Three fissile fuels

were examined as makeup for cases with the conversion
ratio less than 1, These fuels were 233U, mixed
plutonium representative of light-water-reactor dis-
charge, and 93%-enriched 23%U. The 235U seems to be
the least desirable fuel because of the buildup of the
neutron poisons 226U and 237Np. It must be noted,
however, that 237 Np in these calculations was assumed
to be processed out of the primary fuel salt at the very
slow rate of 6.3% per year, that is, on a 16-year cycle. A
much more rapid removal of neptunium, which may be
feasible, would make the 235 U feed look relatively

- more attractive,

This study po_mts up the importance of rapid (and by
implication, inexpensive) processing to the breeding
performance of the MSBR and indicates the great
extent to which the performance reported for the

- reference MSBR is a function of the selection of

reference processing cycle times.

6.1.2 Designs for First-Generation
Molten-Salt Power Reactors

H. F. Bauman

The successful operation of the MSRE suggests that a
moltensalt reactor designed to exploit today’s tech-
nology could help to meet the rapidly increasing
demand for electric power in the United States. The
reference single-fluid MSBR design goes beyond MSRE
technology in two important areas; first, the core power

density is higher so that the moderator graphite must be

replaced at intervals because of radiation damage, and

second, an ondine chemical processing plant is required
to separate the 2?3Pa and fission products from the
fuel stream. The extension of the technology into these -
areas will require some further development, and
carrying - this development forward to the point where,
for example, a chemical process has been demonstrated
on an engineering scale will take time.

In a search for reactor designs that could, in the
meantime, exploit the technology that we now have in
hand, we have calculated the nuclear performance of
several designs that sidestep one or both of these
development areas. With respect to chemical processing,
we considered either the case of an equilibrium fuel
cycle with continuous processing for isolation of
protactinium and removal of fission products or the
case of a batch fuel cycle without removal of poisons
except by infrequent discard and replacement of the
fuel salt. In the latter case, the uranium in the discarded
salt (but not the plutonium) is assumed to be recovered

by the well-established fluoride volatility process and

recycled to the reactor. Thus the higher isotopes of
uranium, as well as *37Np, are allowed to reach

therefore half the batch cycle time. The fission product
nuclides in general lie between these two extremes, and
we have arbitrarily taken two-thirds as the average ratio
of the equivalent equilibrium cycle time to the batch
cycle time in calculating the cost of discarding salt. It is

" not necessary to know this ratio-accurately in order to -

make a good estimate of the fuel cycle cost, because for
batch discard cycles longer than two or three years the
costs are not very sensitive to the cycle time. This is
because cost penalties associated with decreasing con-
version ratio, as the batch cycle is lengthened, are

-approximately offset by reduced salt replacement cost.
_ . Perhaps the most obvious design, and one of the most

attractive, is the “big MSRE,” a single-fluid prismatic-

- core reactor like the MSRE and large enough (that is, of

equilibrium. The average performance of the reactor -

during such a batch cycle is simulated by an equivalent

equilibrium fuel cycle calculation (performed with the
ROD code). The equivalence. is at best approximate,
because saturation - effects associated with neutron
~ absorption are different for different nuclides. For
~ rapidly ‘saturating nuclides, the average concentration
approaches the concentration at the end of the cycle,

and the equivalent equilibrium cycle time approaches:

the batch cycle time. For slowly saturating nuclides,
which essentially build up linearly, the average con-
centration is approximately half the end-of-cycle con-
centration, and the equivalent equilibrium cycle time is

sufficiently low power density) that the ‘moderator

‘graphite would not have to be replaced because of

radiation damage in the anticipated life of the reactor.
The performance of this type of reactor, with and
without chemical processing, is given in columns 2 and
3 of Table 6.2. In both cases the core salt fractions were
adjusted by zones to flatten the damage flux near the
center of the core, giving a smaller core for the same

- moderator life. The case with processing is a moderate-

performance breeder, with a fuel-cycle cost not much

“higher than calculated for the reference MSBR (column

1). It differs from the reference breeder mainly in
having a larger core and a higher fissile inventory. For

fBased on scaling the reference MSBR processing costs with a 0,5-power scale factor. Since this scaling does not weight fixed
costs sufficiently at very low processing rates, an allowance for fixed costs of 0.05 mill/kwhr was added for the 30/100 case, and 0.1
mill/kwhr for the throwaway cases.

NOTES: The calculations were based on a l(}DO-Mw(e) reactor with a thermal power of 2250 Mw(th) and an (.8 plant factor.

The fissile feed in converter cases was assumed to be mixed plutonium typical of light-water-reactor discharge with the following

composition: 23%Py, 60%; 24°Pu, 24%; 24! Pu, 12%; 2?Py, 4%.

the no-processing or “throwaway” case, it is assumed
that the salt is discarded at an economically optimum
interval. The throwaway case is a high-gain converter
reactor rather than a breeder, but the fuel cycle cost is
very attractive. It proved economically worth while in
this case to lower the thorium concentration to 8%,
reducing the fissile inventory at the expense of reducing
the conversion ratio. Such a plant could be designed for
the addition of processing at some ]ater time, thus
upgrading it toa breeder.

Another design approach‘ is to make the core of a

random-packed bed of graphite spheres. Such a-pebble-
bed core has several advantages. The manufacture of the
small spheres of high-grade isotropic graphite is entirely

within today’s technology. A pebble bed will accom-

modate radiation-induced dimensional changes in the
graphite, and, finally, if- necessary, small graphite
spheres can be replaced more easily than large prismatic
elements

At
 

 

 

 

The main disadvantage of the pebble-bed core is that
the salt fraction is inherently about 0.37, whereas the
optimum for the best nuclear performance lies in the

‘range 0,12 to 0.15, Even when the thorium concentra-

tion in the salt is reduced as partial compensation for

the high salt fraction, as in the cases shown in columns

4 and 5 of Table 6.2, the performance of the
pebble-bed cores is well below that of similar prismatic
cores. In case S-8-12, the core size was optimized for
minimum fuel-cycle cost and resulted in a graphite life
of about 9 years. In case S9-12, the core was made

large enough so that the graphite would last the 30-year

life of the reactor, but as a result the fissile inventory
and the fuel cycle cost are particularly high.
- Of the designs considered here, the “big MSRE” with

 throwaway processing (case CC-167-9) appears to best

meet the criteria of low-cost power and little develop-
ment beyond scaleup from MSRE technology. It could

- be designed for the convenient future addition of a

processing plant and would provide an excellent vehicle

for the first fullscale test of mtegral molten-salt

processing.

6.13 Reactivity.Coefficients
O.L. Smi_th J. H. Carswell, Jr.

A number of isothermal temperature coefficients of
reactivity were calculated for the single-fluid MSBR,
using the reference reactor geometry shown in a

_previous progress report.* These calculations  were

performed with a detailed two-dimensional representa-
tion of the reactor in-R-Z geometry, using the diffusion
code CITATION® with nine neutron energy groups.
Both forward and adjoint fluxes were calculated, and
the effects of various changes in microscopic cross
sections or in material densities were calculated by
first-order perturbation theory. The cross sections
themselves were obtained from a series of calculations,
using the code XSDRN,® in which group-average cross

sections were calculated for each major region of the

reactor for each of three different temperatures (800,
900, and 1000°K) and for various combinations of

material densities. In this way the effects of tempera-

ture-dependent chang&s in microscopic cross sections

can be calculated separately from those of tempera-
ture-dependent changes in density. |
" The calculated reactivity coefficients are summarized
in Table 6.3. The. Doppler coefficient is primarily that
of thorium. The graphite thermal base coefficient and
the salt thermal base coefficient, that is, the effects
of microscopic cross-section changes caused by chang-
ing the temperatures of the graphite and the salt,

 respectively, are positive because of the competition
between thermal captures in fuel, which decrease less
rapidly than those of a 1fv absorber, and thermal
captures in thorium, which decrease nearly as 1fv,
with increasing temperature. The salt density compo-
nent represents all effects of salt expansmn including

 the decreasing salt density.

The graphite density component includes both chang-
ing graphite density and displacement of graphite
surfaces. In calculating the displacements it was .
assumed that the graphite-vessel interface did not move,
that is, that the vessel temperature did not change. For
short-term reactivity effects, this is the most reasonable
assumption, since inlet salt bathes the vessel’s inner
face. These dimensional changes in the graphite without
a concomitant expansion of the vessel produce a
significant change in the thickness of the salt annulus
between the core and the reflector. The reactivity effect

- of this change is not readily calculated by perturbation
theory and was therefore obtained by comparison of
two conventional criticality calculations with different
thicknesses of the salt annulus and with appropriately
differing core density. In any case, it should be noted
that the graphite density coefficient is a small and
essentially negligible component.

From Table 6.3 it is seen that the total core
coefficient is negative. But more important, the total

- salt coefficient, which is prompt and largely controls
the fast transient response of the system, is a relatively

large negative coefficient and affords adequate reactor
stability and controllability.
The salt density coefficient is particularly important

64

with regard to bubbles in the core salt. It is expected

that the salt will contain about 1% helium bubbles.
Under certain circumstances the bubbles might expand
or collapse without change in core temperature and
“hence without inwvoking the total salt temperature
coefficient. Since the salt density component is posi-
tive, bubble expansion would produce a positive reactiv-
ity effect. Using a salt expansion-coefficient § V/V =2.1

X 107%/°C, an increase in core bubble fraction from,

say, 0.01 to 0.02 would yield a reactivity change of
8k/k = +0.00039. This is approximately one-fourth the
worth of the delayed neutrons in the core. Analogously,
complete collapse of 2 0.01 bubble fraction would yleld
a reactivity change of 8k/k = —0.00039.

Finally, the fuel concentration coefficient,
(6k/k)/(6n/n), where n is atomic density, was calculated
- to be 042 for *33U and 0.027 for ?33U. The large
difference between these two numbers is primarily a
result of the substantial difference in concentrations
Gie., n;3 = 11 X nys), so that a given fractional
increase in 235U concentration produces a far smaller
reactivity effect than does the same fractional increase
in 233U concentration.

neutron spectrum of the contro! cells, the control rod

region is surrounded by a ring of cells typical of the
adjacent core, followed by a reflected boundary condi-
tion.

The calculatlons were performed in two stages. The
first stage was to generate cross sections. Using the
Monte Carlo code ESP, the regions shown in Fig. 6.2
were mocked up exactly, thereby explicitly taking into

account all geometric and energy-dependent self-shield-

ing effects. Two Monte Carlo calculations were per-

formed, one with salt in the holes of the control cell

of these calculations were two sets of homogeneous
macroscopic nine-group cross sections for the control
region, that is, one set for each configuration. Each set
was based upon 5000 neutron histories, and the
statistical uncertainties in the cross sections are believed
to yield uncertainties in reactivity an order of magni-
tude less than the computed rod worth. Standard
transport theory cell calculations (using the XSDRN
code) were used to generate cross sections for the
remainder of the reactor.

The second stage of computation was to calculate rod
worth. The two sets of cross sections described above
were used in the central regions of two CITATION
diffusion-theory calculations in which the entire reactor

was mocked up in R-Z geometry. The central regions
were of the same sectional area as in the Monte Carlo
calculations but circular in shape. The standard trans-
port theory cross sections were used in the remainder of
the reactor. In the two CITATION calculations the
value of k.gr was computed using each of the two
Monte Carlo crosssection sets in the central region
while keeping other cross sections fixed. The change in
reactivity in going from four graphite rods out to four
10ds in was 8k = k;, — Ko, ¢ = 10.0033.

Since the change in reactivity was anticipated to be
small, it was felt that the geometry of the control
region should be represented in as much detail as
possible to account for all self-shielding effects. Ideally
the entire reactor would have been represented in the

two Monte Carlo calculations, giving control rod worth

directly. However, the machine computing time re-
quired to get adequate statistics for such a large volume
is prohibitively costly. Since the remainder of the

it with more conventional and cheaper computing
methods. | | -

Using the same technique as described above, the
worth of one rod and the worth of three rods were
computed. The results of the calculations are plotted in

Fig. 6.3, together with estimates of the standard

deviation of the results. There appear to be no
significant interaction effects between control rods, and
hence a straight line appears to be the best representa-
tlon of the data.

experiment was about 10% below that expected on the
basis of certain parameters then in use: a fission energy
release of 199.7 Mev/fission® and a power calibration
corresponding to a nominal full power of 8.00 Mw.

During the present report period, these two parame-
ters have been undergoing careful reexamination. The
heat balance power calibration is discussed in Sect.
1.2.11. Revised values of fission energy release for
several fissile nuclides and for operation with 225U and
233U fuels are reported below. The appropriate value is
then combined with the observed 235U depletion rate
to derive an independent measurement of the nominal
full power: 7.30 £ 0.10 Mw. A comparison is made with

~ a measurement based similarly on the buildup of 236U

in the fuel:® 7.45 £ 0.18 Mw. A combined value of 7.34
1 0.09 Mw is suggested. .

‘Some recent values for the recoverable energy re-
leased in the fission process are given in the second
column of Table 64. The value for 233U is that of
Walker,!'® and the others are averages of those of
Walker and of James.!! From the total energy released,
derived from a mass balance, they subtract the esti-
mated average neutrino energy and the long-term (>3
years) fission product decay energy. The latter amounts
to about 0.2 Mev/fission; I estimate that subtracting an
additional 0.1 Meyv/fission would exclude decay energy
released after about six months, and subtracting an-

.other 0.1 Mev/fission would exclude decays after about

two months.

cated (*1.9%) represents a slight increaseé over the

. purely statistical curve-fitting error (+1.7%) reported, to

allow for possible errors in the 7% adjustment for fuel
drains and flushes. The adjustment error, assumed to be
$0.7%, is incorporated in the manner of independent
errors. Using the measured capture-to-absorption ratio
listed above, one can convert the 235U buildup rate to
a 335U depletion rate and proceed as before to infer a
value for nominal full power: 745 + 0.18 Mw. |

In summary, we have made two determinations of
nominal full power that are basically experimental. The
only dependence on calculated cross sections is through
small corrections to the experimental data (see ref. 7);
for this, we use calculated ratios of absorption cross
sections (23¢U/%35U and 238U/?35U), and for these
ratios a generous uncertainty assignment (£10%) has
been included. The two power determinations proceed
from entirely independent experimental data, but much
of the subsequent data reduction involves common
parameters. Hence the two power estimates are only
partially independent. A summary of the results, with
an estimated overall combined value, is given in Table

7.1 MOLTEN-SALT STEAM GENERATOR
R. E. Helms

A steam generator development program plan is being
formulated to develop the technology required to
produce and successfully operate a molten-salt-heated
steam generator. This plan includes programs for the
procurement of steam generators for the MSBE from
industrial manufacturers and for the construction and
operation of a test stand for evaluating steam generator
concepts proposed for the MSBE. A discussion of these
two programs follows.

7.1.1 Steam Generator Indﬁsfrial
Program

A request for proposal péckage is being prepared for

use in obtaining proposals from industrial manufac-

turers to prepare conceptual designs of steam generators
for large MSBR’s and to design, develop, and fabricate
~ models of those steam generators for the MSBE. Rough
drafts have been written of the proposed scope of work,
a general description of the primary and secondary salt
systems and the steam system of an MSBR, and the
design criteria for a molten-salt generator.

7.1.2 Steam Generator Tube Test Stand ; o

The preparation of the conceptual system design
description (CSDD) for the steam generator tube test
stand (STTS)' is nearing completion. All sections of the
CSDD have been written and are being combined into

operation at subcritical and supercritical pressures with
feedwater temperatures up to 700°F. The STTS will be
used to test 3.0-Mw units containing full-length tubes in
configurations representative of steam generator designs

-for a molten-salt breeder reactor experiment.
- We have examined startup and operating parameters

for a 3.0-Mw molten-salt-heated steam generator test
section for testing in the STTS. The ranges of startup
and operating parameters are shown in Table 7.1.

The salt system for the STTS includes a salt pump, -

- direct resistance heater as the heat source, associated

piping to the test section, a venturi meter to measure
salt flow, a drain tank, and an associated freeze valve,
Gas-fired furnaces® were investigated as a possible
heat source. However, heating by passing electrical
current through a section of the loop piping is preferred

- because of the smaller salt inventory in the loop, the

67

“shorter loop circuit time, the faster response to load
changes because of the smaller heat capacity, and better -

apparent control of the system over a wide range of
operating conditions (20—100%).

Sodium fluoroborate, with impurities in the ranges
shown in Table 7.2, is the reference salt. The STTS may
also be operated with fluoride salt mixtures that melt at
temperatures as high as 850°F and as low as 640°F.
(Sodium fluoroborate reference salt melts at 716°F.) A

~ higher-melting-point salt is ‘the MSRE coolant salt,

LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %). A lower-melting-point salt is
NaF-LiF-BeF, (27-35-38 mole %). Both of these salts

- have a higher viscosity than sodium fluoroborate.

A steam feedwater system has been selected that will
permit a broad investigation of the technology of
salt-heated steam generators. A pressure letdown system
provides a facility that can be used for demonstration
of the coupling, startup, and operation of the salt and

steam-feedwater system with the salt in the shell side Qf |
the steam generator test section at an initial tempera-.

ture of 1000°F. The pressure letdown system also
permits the use of full-ﬂow demineralization w1th
conventional equipment..

In the operation of a high-pressure, once-through
steam generating unit, high-purity feedwater is required.

- The feedwater purity criteria established for the STTS

are shown in Table 7.3. This requirement is also critical
for the STTS because solids in the feedwater will either

deposit in the steam generating test unit, resulting in
loss of steam generator efficiency, or will be carried
through the steam generator unit and deposited in the
expansion valve area. Failure to maintain high-purity -
water in the STTS can result in faulty heat transfer data
and costly outages for chemical cleaning or for repairing

- equipment which has been damaged by erosion and

corrosion,
An externally regenerated ammonium hydrox:de

. (AMMONEX) mixed-bed demineralizer system has been

selected for the condensate purification system because
of low operating and capital cost and because these
beds do not deplete the ammonia which is added to the

~ condensate for pH control.

Heat balances for three test sections wzth different
feedwater-steam conditions at 3.0 Mw rated load were
made to establish criteria for the steam-feedwater
system components. The first system heat balance used -
feedwater at 700°F and 3800 psia with outlet steam
conditions of 1000°F and 3600 psia. These feedwater-
steam conditions are typical of the ORNL MSBR
reference design. The second system heat balance used
feedwater at SSO°F and 4000 psia with outlet steam
conditions of 1000°F and 3600 psia. These feedwater-
steam conditions are typical of modern  supercritical
fossil-fired power plants. The third system heat balance
used feedwater at 550°F and 3100 psia with outlet
steam conditions of 1000°F and 2400 psia. These
feedwater-steam conditions are typical of modern sub-
critical fossil-fired power plants. The above feedwater-
steam conditions are considered typical for use with the
test sections that will be produced during the steam
generator development program.

2.2 SODIUM FLUOROBORATE TEST LOOP
| R.B. Gallaher  A.N.Smith

The 800-gpm PKP-1 isothermal pump loop continued
circulating NaBF, -NaF (92-8 mole %) for investigations
‘of the removal of salt mist and acid liquid from the
off-gas stream. Cumulative circulation time as of March
4 was 11,154 hr, of which 10,154 hr have been with the
second batch of salt. During the report period the loop
operated 2954 hr and was drained five times, once on
September 23 when a salt leak was found near a
pressure transmitter and four times for mspectron and
modification of the hot mist trap.

7.2.1 Salt Leak frorn Pressure Transmitter

On the morning of September 23, 1969, a salt leak
“was discovered.® The initial indications of trouble were

a decrease in pump bowl liquid level of 8% (~0.8 in.
salt), an apparent decrease in the temperature of the
circulating salt, and irregular temperatures at the two
venturi pressure transmitters or pressure measuring
devices (PMD). A visual inspection inside the loop
enclosure revealed a mass of frozen salt hanging from
the insulation surrounding both PMDs and a small
quantity of salt in the drip pan beneath the PMDs,
Using normal shutdown procedures, the pump was
stopped and the salt was drained into the drain tank.
The leak was found to be in the pressure transmitter
(PMD-104A) at the venturi inlet in the weld which joins
a Y -in.-IPS pipe to the boss on the diaphragm flange of
the transmitter. This is a stagnant salt zone serving only
to sense venturi inlet pressure whrch is about 100 psig
with the pump on.

The orientation of the PMDs, wluch are fabricated of
Inconel, is such that they do not drain when the loop
proper is drained. Because of the fear of damaging the
diaphragms by freezing and thawing the salt, it has been
customary to maintain the PMDs at 1000°F at all times, -
even when the loop is not operating. Also, when a
different type of salt is charged into the ldop, the old
salt must be drsplaced from the PMDs by a process of
mixing.

The defective PMD was removed from the system, the
 pipe stub to which it had been attached was capped,
and operation of the loop was resumed. The signal from -
a PMD near the pump. drscharge was used for the
venturi reference

 

3R. B. Gallaher and A. N. Smith, Salt Leak from Sodium
Fluoroborate Loop Pressure Transmitter, MSR-69-122 (Dec, 18,
1969).

Metallurgical examination of the PMD* indicated that

~ the weld which was made by the instrument vendor was

defective when the instrument was received in 1956,
and repairs had been made by application of braze
metal to the interior surface. Details of the examination
are reported in Part 5, Materials Development, of this
report. It is estimated that the PMD was in the loop for
at least eight years and, prior to the current fluo-
roborate service, was operated for three years wrth a
salt similar to the MSRE fuel salt. |

About 7% kg of a calculated loss of 11 kg of salt was
recovered from the drip pan and the outside of the
insulation. The salt level in the pump bowl decreased
8% in the 24 hr preceding the shutdown. This rep-
resents an average leak rate of 4 c¢/min,

When the insulation was removed, some bright green
salt was found near the metal surfaces. Chemical

analysis of the salt is shown in Table 7.4. The

composition is similar to that of the green films formed
during tests with a “cold finger.”® It probably resulted
from high localized corrosion of the Inconel-sheathed
Calrod, the external flange surface, and the stainless
steel shim stock which surrounded the heaters. Such
high corrosion rates would be expected with metal
exposed to NaBF, at high temperature in air.

The chemical analyses of the salt recovered from the

. outside of the insulation and of the salt in the system

when circulation was restarted are also shown in Table
7.4. There was very little, if any, change in the
composition of the salt lost from the loop except for a
slight decrease in chromium and an increase in O,.
Chromium-containing compounds may have solidified
first and appeared as part of the green salt found near
the piping. -

The conclusions from the examrnatron are as follows:

1. The salt leak was attnbuted to the failure of a weld
joint which was defective ongmally and had been
repaired by a technique which would not now be
- recommended for molten-salt service at 1000°F. The
fact that the leak occurred during fluoroborate
service was coincidental.

2. The very mild corrosion by the stagnant’salt in the

~ pipe between the PMD and the loop was like that
- experienced ' with Inconel in similar servrce wrth
' NaBF.; salt in other loops

3. The consequences of the leak can be characterized as
rather mild. Fumes were carried off to the stack by
_the controlled ventilation system. There was no
indication of fire or sudden energy release. The
condition of the metal in the vicinity of the leakage

~ path in the pipe wall seemed to indicate that the
leak was not self-aggravating; that.is, continued

~ leakage did not result in an increase in the rate of
leakage.

7.2.2 GasSystem Studies

The purpose of the hot mist trap is to remove most of
the salt mist from the gas stream coming from the
pump bowl while still in the hot zone so that it can be
~ returned to the salt stream. In the proposed scheme the
‘mist remaining in the flowing gas leaving the hot mist
trap would pass through an unheated section to permit
the particles to freeze and then to be collected on a
- replaceable filter. The overall objective of the program

is to reduce the quantity of material that leaves the hot

mist trap and then to provide for its removal in the
replaceable filter without fouling the intervening lines.
The size of a practical replaceable filter and the desired
minimum replacement. interval will establish the ef-
ficiency required for the hot mist trap. In the tests of
the four mist traps described below, the performance is
measured by the reduction in the material collected in
the replaceable (Hoke) filter and in the intervening
lines. Measurements made at intervals during tests No.
2, 3, and 4 indicated that the flow of salt mist into the
hot mist trap was essentially constant at 30 mg/hr.

We continued®. to get accumulations of an oillike
fluid in a 32°F ,cold trap which is downstream of the

 

6MSR Program Semiann. Progr, Rept Aug 31 1969,
ORNL-4449, p. 76

_replaceable filter of the mist trap filter test section. The
. collection rate was about S to 10 mg/hr, amounting to

an average concentration of 0.08 g of fluid per liter of
helium. In some instances we noted films in the cold
end of the mist trap and in the Hoke filter, where the
operating temperature is 100 to 200°F. Study of this
material is continuing, but we still have not reached a
definite conclusion as to its cause or composition.

Test 1. — The first test was a repetition of the settling
tank test, described in the previous report,” which used
a 1-in.-ID by 13-in.-long pipe mounted verticaily. In the
current test, however, a flow diverter was installed at
the trap inlet to minimize the possibility of a short

~ circuit through the trap. The hot mist trap temperature

was held at about 1000°F at the inlet and 200°F at the
outlet. The calculated linear gas velocities for these
temperatures are 0.18 and 0.08 fps respectively. It was
expected that the larger droplets would settle back to
the hot zone and thereby return to the salt stream and
not enter the line to the replaceable filter. During the
2650 hr of operation there was a total of 57 g of salt
which passed through. the trap into the outlet line and
replaceable filter section. Although some of the salt
entering the trap probably settled and returned to the
pump bowl, that which passed through the trap was
excessive for a practical system. When the trap was

. examined after shutdown on October 29, no salt was

found in the hot zone, indicating that no high-melting
phase was formed. Only a light film of salt formed on
the walls in the region where the gas cooled below the
freezing point of the salt. An accumulation of salt was
found in the outlet line where the diameter decreased
abruptly adjacent to a ball valve. Other portions of the
tubing showed no evidence of plugging.

For tests 2, 3, and 4, the test section was oriented so’
that the pipe axis was almost horizontal rather than
vertical, and the size was changed to 2 in. ID by 15 in.
long for tests 2 and 3 and 20 in. long for test 4,

Test 2. — For test 2 a porous metal filter (Huyck
metal FM-225, 98% removal of 1.4 p particles) was
installed in the heated section. The first half of the trap
was equipped with a heater and insulation so that the
temperature of the off-gas could be controlled up to
1200°F. The rest of the trap was unheated and could be
operated insulated or bare. Catch basins were installed
on either side of the filter to separate salt that ran down
the filter surface from that which settled out of the gas
stream, The test period was limited to 15 days to avoid
exceeding the capacity of a catch basin should all the
salt accumulate at one face of the filter. .

The system was operated for 330 hr before being shut
- down on November 24 for removal and inspection of
the mist trap. During the first 290 hr the heated section
of the trap was held at 950°F, and the gas left the
unheated section at about 200°F. During the last 40 hr
the unheated section was insulated, which increased the
trap temperature to 1000°F and the gas leaving the trap

" to 700°F. The pressure drop across the mist trap

increased by 0.5 psi during the ﬁrst seven days and then
remained constant,

The Hoke filter downstream of the mist trap was
removed for inspection after seven days of operation
and was found to contain a clear oillike liquid. We
believe that the liquid accumulated during the pre-
heating of the system prior to filling with salt. The
pressure drop across the filter was high when circulation
-of salt was started and remained constant, Also, some
fouling of the off-gas pressure control valve occurred
~ during this test for the first time since the cold trap was
put into service. The liquid must have been swept
through the off-gas system and the cold trap before
normal operating conditions were established. - ‘

The liquid collection rate in the cold trap averaged
8.0 X 1072 + 2.8 X 1072 g/hr during the run, When we
inspected the mist trap we found some small spheres of
salt (%, ¢ to % in. diam) covered with a dark film on the
upstream side of the filter element. The filter face was
-also coated with a dark-colored deposit.  On the
downstream side the salt had formed a pool inside and
outside the catch basin, No dark films were observed on
the salt pool. Several large (% to % in.) pieces of dark
material were found in the same area. Also, the %-in.
line at the discharge of the trap contained a plug of
similar material. This plug had not restricted the gas
- flow enough to be detectable by pressure drop measure-

ments and did not appear to have filtered out any salt.

The quantity of salt which passed through the filter
and scttled out in the 2-in, pipe section was equivalent
to about 50% of the estimated 30 mg/hr leaving the
pump bowl. The removal was probably because the
sintered metal filter had agglomerated the fine mist into
larger particles which then settled rapidly from the gas
stream. There was no evidence of salt in the replaceable
filter or in the intervening line; however, the dark
material at the trap discharge could have affected the
transfer into the line before the end of the trap was
raised to a 700°F discharge temperature, We concluded
that the method of agglomerating the mist was success-
ful and that this arrangement was an improvement over
the previous trap.

Test 3. — The mist trap was reinstalled for the thxrd
test with an element fabricated from Multi-Metal
NEVA-CLOG. The material consists of two perforated
sheets (0.040-in.-diam holes on % ,-in. centers) spaced.
about 0,020 in. apart, with the holes in one sheet offset
from those in the other. There was a catch basin in both
the upstream and the downstream side of the NEVA-
CLOG element. The test.lasted for 433 hr with the
heated portion maintained at 860°F. The unheated
section was uninsulated; and the gas left the trap at

~ about 180°F.
- Based on periodic welghmgs of the Hoke filter in the

discharge line from the mist trap, the rate of solids
leaving the trap decreased from 11 X 1073 gfhr at the
beginning of the run to zero during the last week.
During the test the liquid collection rate in the cold
trap averaged 6.7 X 1072 g/hr. No fouling of the off-gas
pressure control valve occurred. The test was ter-
minated when the pressure drop across the mist trap
assembly increased from 0.7 to 2.3 psi in one day.
When the mist trap was removed, the ¥%-in. discharge
line again contained a plug. About 0.5 g of the white
salt and dark oily material were removed from the line.
The plug probably accounted for at least part of the
decrease in the rate of solids leaving the trap and the

~ increase in the pressure drop.

The walls of the mist trap downstream of the filter

: we:e coated with a thin film of salt. About 1.8 g of .
“solids were recovered from' this area. Based on.the

weight of solids collected on the Hoke filter and in the
discharge line, the arrangement with the NEVA-CLOG
element did not remove sufficient salt from the gas
stream to be of use.

elements, one in the heated section and one in the cool
section. The heated zone arrangement was similar to
that in.test 2, but the additional element was added to
remove all the solids before they could enter the
- discharge line and cause plugging problems. - While
- admittedly avoiding the line-plugging problem for the

72

moment, the arrangement did permit a better evalua-

tion of the hot mist trap itself.

The heated section was held at 950°F, and the gas left
the cool section at about 180°F. During operatiori there
was little or no change in the pressure drop across either
filter element in the mist trap., No salt was found in the
* Hoke filter when it was examined after 5, 15, and 40
~days of operation; however, a thin oily ﬁlm was

present on the surface of the housing in the entrance

section. The rate of collection of liquid in the cold trap

7.3.1 MSBE Salt Pmnp Procurement

A response to our request for proposal® to produce
the MSBE salt pumps was received from Westinghouse
Electro Mechanical Division, Cheswick, Pennsylvania.

Bingham-Willamette Company of Portland, Oregon, and

~ the Byron Jackson Pump Division of Borg-Warner

time. No fouling of the off-gas pressure control valve .

- was noted. The trap was operated for 1011 hr before
being shut down on March 4 for inspection.

When the mist trap was opened, 0.5 g of salt was
recovered from the entrance area. The upstream face
of the hot filter was coated with a dark film, and there
were some clear spheres of salt, 0.010 in. in diameter
and smaller, on the surface. Essentially all the salt
- carried out of the pump bowl during the test (32.7 g)
had collected in a pool between the two filter elements.
The upstream face of the cold filter element had a
0.01-in.-thick film of very light-colored salt particles
estimated to weigh <0.4 g. Downstream of this filter
the cold walls had a thin coating of dark material which
- was soluble in acetone, perchloroethylene, and kero-
sene, but insoluble in alcohol and water. These tests
indicate that the film is probably a hydrocarbon. There
was no plug in the discharge line.

- It can be concluded from this test that the fine mist
had agglomerated into larger droplets in passing through

the hot filter and that these then settled to the bottom

of the trap before reaching the cold filter. The fine
particles remaining were solidified and trapped in the
cold filter in a manner which did not produce a
measurable pressure drop. Although the hot trap
.performed very well in passing only 0.4 g while holding
up 32.7 g in 1011 hr, the performance might be further
improved by the use of a second hot filter element of
the NEVA-CLOG type to remove some of the remain-
‘ing fine particles. Since the cold filter must be
replaceable, further study must be made of the design
requirements for the lines and necessary valving be-

Corporation of Los Angeles, Calrforma, did not submit
proposals.

The one proposal was reviewed by members of the
evaluation team, the MSR program, and other members

~of the Laboratory, and the list of questions and

comments generated by the review was submitted to

Westinghouse. A very brief résumé of the questions and -
‘comments indicates that we ask Westinghouse for -

exposition of (1) their plans to meet the requirements

of the RDT quality assurance program, (2) the scope -

and content of the water test facilities and test program

that they plan, and (3) the effect on estimated cost and

schedule of providing more time for the feedback of
information from salt testing of the prototype pump
into the design of the MSBE pumps.

The evaluation team will use the Westinghouse re-
sponse to the list of questions and comments to
complete its evaluation and recommendation for the

proposal. At present we are favorably impressed with

the scope and content of the proposal.

7.3. 2 MSBE Salt Pump Test Stand

~ 7.4 REMOTE WELDING
P.P.Holz C.M. Smith, Jr.

The remote welding program'® has concentrated on
parametric studies of pipe end configurations and weld
inserts to find the best joint design for use in remote
welding. All the welding tests were performed with the

" orbital - equipment including a new and improved

programmer-controller - which provided very effective
automatic self-regulating control of the welding vari-

| ables.

A quantity of 6-in. sched 80 type 347 stainless steel
pipe was available from surplus stock and was used for
initial development work. Procedures were developed
for welding with washer-shaped inserts and with com-
mercially available Y-ring inserts.}* For some tests, the
pipe wall at the joint was machined to simulate a flat
washer “insert”; for others, weld metal was deposited
on the pipe inner surface and then machined to
simulate the washer “insert,” and for others, actual
insert rings were tack-welded to one of the pipe joint
ends. These joint configurations are illustrated in Fig.
7.2. The tests showed that the “buttered” insert,
prepared by depositing weld metal around the pipe
interior and then machining the deposit to a washer
shape, is best for remote welding applications. Machin-
ing the pipe walls to simulate a washer-shaped insert has

" the disadvantage of thinning the pipe walls adjacent to

the weld. The tack-welded inserts were too easily
damaged to be suitable for remotely controlled installa-

~ tion, positioning, and alignment. The weld inserts do

offer the most economical method of welding and are
recommended for direct construction or shop welding.
The washer-shaped insert gives best results for badly
misaligned welds. It is a tribute to the orbital equip-

- ment that high-quality welds were made every time,

whichever type of joint design was used.
Following the experimental joint welding tests with

'6-in. pipe of type 347 stainless steel, we made addi-

tional tests with type 304 stainless steel and Hastelloy
N pipe. Hastelloy N pipe was available only in a small
quantity of 5-in.-diam sched 40 pipe. Our prototype
orbital carriage is designed to fit only 6- to 9-in.-diam

necessary for the filler passes, which were generally
made at the same torch speed and with feed rates of 10

oscillated approximately %, ¢ 'in. back and forth during

Tlustrations in Sect. 20:1 show the good quality and
full penetration of welds on 6-in. type 347 stainless

© steel, even when the pipe ends mismatch by as much as

' 6 in., which is the full thickness of the machined land

protrusions at the pipe joint ends. Being able to make a

good weld with this much mismatch will reduce the
alighment problems in remote maintenance.

The pipe in any nuclear reactor system will be under
stress from thermal effects, from gravity, and from
other factors relating to installation and operation of
the system. One must expect springback of the ends
when a pipe is cut from maintenance. The springback
we have experienced in the experimental reactors and
test loops has often been as much as several inches. We
know, therefore, that we must be prepared to realign

replacement pipe assemblies and hold them in position
with not more than ¥ ¢ in. misalignment. -

To maintain pipe ends in alignment for final joint
preparation and welding, we are presently thinking of
using a split sleeve which would be cradled over and
clamped to the pipe. The split sleeve includes split roller
bearings and a bearing-mounted gear drive at one end to

rotate the sleeve about the pipe. Our orbital machinery

would then be clamped -over this sleeve, and the
programmed carriage rotation would be transferred
from the carriage rollers to the sleeve drive. The sleeve
could be utilized to collect chips during cutting to keep
them from entering the reactor system; it would also
provide a properly indexed and concentric platform for
mounting internal pipe cleaning gear. The sleeve can
serve as an alignment and restraining device to guide the
pipe ends into proper position during reassembly. It
offers “glove-box™ welding capability in that the sleeve

forms a secondary containment over the pipe. A gas

purge stream can be used to seal off the cutter and
torch access slot. Other sleeve-type devices of different
design but with similar advantages are also bemg
studned

“During the reporting period we were able to borrow
additional Air Force orbital equipment for 1- to 3-in.
pipe and for 12- to 16-in. pipe. Minor alterations were
made to the large Air Force carriage so that it would
 

 

 

 

 

accommodate the ORNL-built cutter and weld-head
inserts and the modified programmer-controller cir-
cuitry, An extra Air Force welding head was modified
to incorporate some of the ORNL design changes and
thus to provide an interchangeable spare. We also made
major improvements to our original ORNL remote
welding head to provide additional torch oscillation
capability in the short-width ranges. We provided a
single-unit disconnect for all torch lines, using the
commercial Air Reduction Sales Company HP20A
water-cooled TIG torch cable set, The wire feeder spool
was provided with more precise bearing support, and
the torch position adjustments were modified to in-
crease the horizontal and vertical travel capability, Most
important, however, was the modification to in-
corporate a miniature Hayden dc motor atop the weld
head to drive a ball screw assembly for vertical
positioning of the torch. Figure 7.3 shows the motor
addition,

Preliminary weld trials of the root passes on 12-in,
sched 10 type 304 stainless steel pipe had indicated
severe problems in maintaining proper arc length
control to provide the steady arc voltage needed for
uniform weld metal puddling and weld bead control.
When the pipe was very much out of round, the
mechanical spring-loaded torch positioning device could
not adjust well enough to provide acceptable control.
The incorporation of an automatically controlled drive .
motor to move the torch up and down and thus
stabilize the welding arc voltage has given vastly
improved control. The arc voltage signal that was
already available in the programmer is used to actuate
the new drive motor and to regulate the torch-to-work
spacing. . ' T —

The original control system used the arc-voltage signal
to control the welding wire feed rates. Close torch-to-
work spacings lowered the arc voltage and thus called

for a decrease in the wire feed rate; distant torch-to-
work spacings gave higher arc voltages and stimulated
an increase in wire feed rate. The system worked well
within limited arc voltage changes but was not satis-
factory for responding to large changes in arc voltage.
Our newly incorporated control system uses the same
arc voltage signal and the original wire feed control
system within the range where its control is satis-

78

factory, but actuates the new drive motor when a

predetermined and preset upper or lower arc voltage

setting is reached. The motor then drives the torchto a:

torch-to-work spacing that gives the designated control
point arc voltage. Here the wire-feed-rate control again
takes over until its control range limits are reached once
more. The actuation range settings for the new torch
drive control system are variable to permit numerous
weld operations. under different welding conditions.
Although “the old arc voltage control system was

repair cdpability It is now possiblé to let the torch seek
the vicinity of the pipe, start the arc, and automatlcally
return to a preset arc voltage. c

Having a torch which adjusts itself to maintain the
proper arc gap for best welding will make it easier to
use the remote welding system without the orbital
carriage to work on components other than pipes. A
variety of welding head suspension and guided move-
ment systems can be used for remote welding much

- more readily now that self-adjusting features are avall-

able for regulating the arc gap.

We also obtained, on loan from the Air Force,
automated Orbit-Arc equipment for fusion TIG welding
of thin-wall tubing in sizes from % to 1% in. in
diameter. This equipment was developed by North

- American Rockwell Corporation for operation with the

satisfactory within its range limits, it works even better

in conjunction with the new drive motor control. We
have found that we can use the arc voltage to set and
‘control the torch-to-work spacing as well as to maintain
this spacing within limits that offer uniformity in

welding. The new system is also very useful for root -

- pass fusion weldments without wire feed, as uniformity
in torch spacing assures even and full penetratlon with
proper bead shape.

The new arc voltage control system also mcorporates
automatic “touchdown weld start” and improved weld

orbital system programmer which we already have.
Orbit-Arc tube welding equipment is now commercially
marketed by the Merrick Engineering Corporation of
Nashville, Tennessce, under license from North
American Rockwell. In its present  form Orbit-Arc
equipment cannot be mounted on tubing by remote
means, though design changes could permit remote

.operations. Preliminary results from weld tests to check

out the equipment on 1-in. stainless tubing look very
promising. The equipment will next be tried on

‘molybdenum tubing and T-111 tantalum alloy tubing.

8.1 CONTROL SYSTEM ANALYSIS

Simulation studies of the reference 1000-Mwi{e)
MSBR on an analog computer were continued. These

- simulation studies are an extension of those reported

earlier.'*? The basic plant components simulated were
the reactor, primary heat exchanger, and steam genera-
tor., The lumped-parameter model used for the heat
transfer system included ten spatial lumps in the
primary heat exchanger and in the steam generator and
nine spatial lumps 'in the reactor core. Two-delayed-
neutron-group circulating-fuel kinetics equations were
used. A provision for variable flow of the primary salt,
secondary salt, and steam, with the attendant variations
in film heat transfer coefficients, was included.

The investigation was concerned with the integrated
plant response; it was not concerned with a safety
analysis of the system, although several of the transients
introduced would be of an-abnormal nature (e.g., loss

of flow). It was an initial probe into the response of the

system initiated by such perturbations as changes in-

load demand, loss of primary or secondary flow, and

reactivity changes. A complete report on the methods

and results of these studies is in preparation,?
So that the model would have the maximum dynanuc
range, the system differential equations were not

linearized, and, as a result, the available quantity of.

equipment required the model to be severely limited
spatially to minimize the number of equations. In
addition the pressure in the water side of the steam

generator, as well as in the rest of the plant, and the

physical properties of the salts and water were taken to
be time invariant, The temperature of the feedwater to

the steam generators was also held constant.

The plant control system investigated was one which
controlled the reactor outlet temperature as a function -
of plant load. Steady-state calculations showed that, by
specifying the steady-state primary salt flow rate, the
reactor outlet temperature, and the feedwater and
steam temperatures as a function of load, the remaining
steady-state system temperatures and flow rates can be
determined. The primary salt flow rate was held
constant at its 100% design point value, and the
feedwater and steam temperatures were held constant’
at 700 and 1000°F respectively. The reactor outlet
temperature was varied with the plant load (Fig. 8.1).
The resulting variations of the reactor inlet temperature
and the secondary salt hot and cold leg temperatures
and flow rates for the analog simulation model are also
shown in Fig. 8.1.

The reactor outlet temperature was varied as a linear
function of the plant load between 1300 and 1125°F
for loads between 100 and 50% respectively. For loads
below 50% the reactor outlet temperature was varied
linearly from 1125 to 1000°F at no load. The break-
point at 50% load was requlred to maintain the reactor
inlet temperature above 1000°F at low loads. Figure
8.1 shows that the steady-state secondary salt flow rate
decreased with a decreasing load at a rate roughly
proportional to load. The secondary salt AT between
the hot and cold legs was, therefore, approximately
constant. Hence the cold leg temperature was required
to decrease from its design point value of 850°F at full
load to below 725°F at loads below about 30%. It -
dropped below its minimum acceptable value of 800°F

~ at approximately 70% load. Steady-state calculations

79

“for this model indicate that, by decreasing the reactor

outlet temperature more rapidly with decreasing load in
the range near 100% load, the secondary salt cold leg
temperature decreased less rapidly with load and
lowered the power level at which it crossed the 800°F
minimum.

Since it may be undesirable to decrease the reactor
outlet temperature more. rapidly with decreasing load
than is shown in Fig. 8.1, other methods may be

required to maintain the steady-state cold leg tempera-

ture above its 800°F minimum at the lower power

levels. Such methods are: (1) increasing the steam
temperature above its 1000°F design point as the load
decreases, with subsequent attemperation of the steam

with injected feedwater; (2) increasing the feedwater

temperature above its 700°F design point as the load
decreases; and (3) reducing the number of steam
generators in use as the load decreases. If valves are
considered for use in the salt systems, other methods
‘may prove feasible as well.

Further “investigations of steady-state temperatures
and flows should be carried out, including studies of
off-design conditions in the steam generator. Insuffi-
cient machine time was available to adjust the present
analog model to include a variable steam or feedwater
temperature with load, and insufficient equipment was
available to include more than one steam generator.

‘The objective of the load control system used in this
. study was to maintain the temperature of the steam
delivered to the turbines at a design value of 1000°F

To accomplish plant load control in this simulation,
an external plant load demand signal was used as input
to the plant control system (Fig. 8.2). The steam flow
rate was made to follow the demand w1th a 5-sec time
constant.

Steam . temperature control was accomplished by
varying the secondary salt flow rate. This method was
chosen because of the relatively tight coupling which

existed between steam temperature and secondary salt
flow rate. The measured steam temperature was com-

pared with its set point of 1000°F, and any error
caused the secondary salt flow rate to change in the

appropriate direction at a rate proportional to the error

if the error was 2°F or less. If the error was greater than
2°F, the rate of change of the secondary salt flow rate

“was lifited to .its rate of change for a 2°F error, which

was approximately 11%j/min.
To accomplish reactor putlet temperature control, an
external plant load demand signial was used to obtain a

" reactor outlet temperature set point. The outlet temper-

during all steady-state conditions and within a narrow

band around this value during plant transients. The
control system used in this simulation is shown in Fig.
8.2. It consisted of a steam temperature controller and
a reactor outlet temperature controller similar to that
used successfully in the MSRE.*

ature set point vs load demand was the same as that for
the steady-state reactor outlet temperature vs load in
Fig. 8.1. The measured value of the reactor inlet
temperature was subtracted from the outlet tempera-
ture set point, and since the primary salt flow rate was
constant, a reactor (heat) power set point was generated
by multiplying this AT by a proportionality constant.
The reactor power set point was a function of inlet
temperature during a transient and thus a function of
dynamic load. The measured value of reactor power

(from neutron flux) was compared with the reactor

~ power set point, and any error was fed to the control

rod servo for appropriate reactivity adjustment, Under
normal conditions the control ,rod servo added or
removed reactivity at a rate proportional to the reactor

power error if the error was 1% or less. If the error was

greater than 1%, the addition or removal rate was
limited to the rate for a 1% error, which was about
0.01% 8k/k per second. The maximum magnitude of
reactivity which the simulation allowed was 1% 8k/k.

During a reduction in load demand the control system
responded as follows: A reduction in load demand
reduced the steam flow rate and the reactor outlet
temperature set point. The decreasing steam flow
transferred less heat out of the steam generator, and the
steam temperature rose. The resulting steam tempera-
ture error decreased the secondary salt flow rate to
transfer less heat into the steam generator. Simultane-

ously, the decrease in the reactor outlet temperature set

point- decreased the power demand set point. The
resulting power demand error caused the control rod

servo to add negative reactivity to bring the reactor .

power down, The system reached the new steady state

~ when the heat transfer system was in equilibrium; the
steam temperature was 1000°F, and the reactor outlet .

temperature was at its set point.

Various load demand transients were investigated,
including changes in demand from 100% load to 90%
and from 100 to 50% at 10%/minute and from 100 to
50% at 5%/min. The results of these studies are

summarized in Table 8.1. Listed in the table are the

listed are the maxima encountered at any time during a
transient; they are not necessarily initial rates of change
or differences in steady-state magnitudes.

The results of 2 load demand change from 100% to
50% at 5%/min are shown in' Fig. 8.3, The steam

temperature was controlled to within 2°F of its design

point, and the reactor outlet temperature closely
followed its set point.

The load demand transient results indicate a stable

82

well-behaved system. Normal load changes at a rate of

5%fmin or less can probably be controlled by a system
similar to that used on the MSRE with the addition of
the steam temperature controller.

Transients initiated by positive and negative reactivity

excursions were investigated. The excursions included a

negative step in reactivity of —0.2% 8k/k and positive
steps of 0.15% 8k/k with and without the control rod

servo operative. The results of these studies are shown

in Table 8.2. The positive reactivity excursions were
begun with the plant at an initial power level of 25%in
order to obtain the maximum positive power excursion
for this simulation, The maximum allowable power was
160% of design power. The results indicate that certain
reactivity transients may require additional control if
undesirably low temperatures of the salts are to be
avoided. For example, if an insertion of negative
reactivity in the core reduces the reactor power, then
the load must be reduced at a rate sufficient to avoid
overcooling the salts. —

Figure 8.4 shows the results of a positive step in
reactivity of 0.15% from an initial power of 25%. The
reactor power increased rapidly to about 144% while
the control rod added negative reactivity at its maxi-

83

mum rate. The sudden increase in the reactor power

caused a rapid increase in the reactor outlet tempera-
ture. An increase in the reactor inlet temperature from
its initial value followed. When the inlet temperature
returned to 1040°F, the reactor power had decreased to
8.5%. Since the reactor outlet temperature set point
was constant during this transient at 1063°F, the

reactor power set point at this time was 9%, and thus
the control system began to add positive reactivity to
the system to increase the reactor power. As the inlet
temperature approached 1000°F, the power set point
approached the initial level of 25%. The temporary
increase in the reactor inlet temperature beginning at
approximately 70 sec was due to the decrease in the
secondary salt flow rate, which was attempting to
control the delayed response in the steam temperature.
The increasing reactor temperatures produced an in-
crease in the steam temperature, which was delayed by
about 65 sec because of the transit time of the
secondary salt between the heat exchangers at the
initial 22% flow rate. The steam temperature rose to
about 1028°F before the decreasing secondary salt flow
rate returned it to 1000°F, The relatively long second-
ary salt loop transit time reduced the capability of the
secondary salt flow rate to control the steam tempera-
ture, and several oscillations were allowed to occur
before the system returned to normal steady-state
conditions at 25% power level. The total excess energy
added to the system by the reactor power “pulse” from
the initial power rise to the point at which the power
first returned to the 25% level was approximately
13,000 Mwsec.

Several transient cases were studied involving primary
and secondary-salt flow rates. Some results of these
studies are summarized in Table 8.3. The simultaneous
coastdown of all four primary pumps to an arbitrary

- minimum flow of 10% was investigated. It was assumed

that some device such as a battery-powered pony motor

on the primary pumps would maintain some minimum
pumping capacity in the primary loop upon loss of
power to the main primary pump motors. The primary
salt flow rate was thus reduced in all parts of the
primary loop to 10% of full flow at a rate of 10%fsec.
The results of this transient are shown in Fig. 8.5, The
proportionality constant between desired reactor AT
and reactor power set point was .decreased with the

- primary salt flow rate, which produced the reactor

power error signal. Negative reactivity was thus intro-
duced at the maximum rate, and the reactor power

- decreased in about 25 sec to about 12%. The maximum

amount of control reactivity required was about
—0.21% &k/k. The reactor outlet temperature rose at
first to about 1400°F in 15 sec, then decreased to
about 1340°F, The inlet temperature fell below 1000°F
in 15 sec, The loss of primary flow while maintaining
full heat extraction from the. steam generators caused
the secondary salt hot leg temperature to fall sharply.
The cold leg temperature also decreased. The decreasing
secondary salt temperatures caused a severe reduction

in steam temperature. The secondary salt flow rate
increased to its limit of 110% in an attempt to maintain
the steam temperature at 1000°, but with little success.
Due to the assumptions concerning the variations in -
steam properties made in formulating the model of the
steam generator used in this simulation, the useful range
of the steam generator model was greatly limited. The
model, therefore, simulated only small variations in
steam temperature near 1000°F. Loss of primary or
secondary flow to 10%, however, effectively decoupled
the reactor from the steam system, and large-magnitude
changes in the steam generator had a greatly reduced
effect on the reactor system. Only the du'ectlon of

‘these changes was important,

A second case involved the same loss of primary flow
as described in the first case but with a reduction in
load demand from 100 to 20% at a rate of 20%/sec.
This rate was determined by the assumed maximum
rate at which the turbine steam interceptor valves could
close. It was assumed that an auxiliary heat rejection
system would be capable of disposing of 20% of the full
plant power. The reduction of load was initiated 5 sec
after the initiation of the primary pump coastdown in
order to simulate some delay time for the system to
sense and evaluate the incident. The proportionality
constant between the desired reactor AT and reactor
power set point again was reduced with the reduction in

flow rate. The reactor power reached 12% in about 20
sec. The reactor outlet temperature again rose to about
1400°F, then decreased to about 1200°F at 60 sec, and
continued to decrease at a rate of about 0.3°F/sec. The
reactor inlet temperature transient was much like that
in the previous case, as were the transients in the
secondary salt hot and cold leg temperatures. |

The steam temperature initially rose in this transient
since the fast load reduction dominated the response in
.the steam generator when it occurred 5 sec after the
primary flow coastdown. However, this did not prevent
large sudden decreases in the secondary salt tempera-
tures. Some additional corrective action may be re-

quired to prevent such decreases in temperature, such as

a reduction in secondary salt flow rate when primary
flow is lost. ‘
~ The results of these pnmary ﬂow transients indicate a
need for further investigation of the conditions existing
in the secondary salt loops and steam generators
- following a loss of primary flow transient. Attention
must be paid to resulting magnitudes and rates of
change of temperature in this part of the system. The
model of the steam generator used in this simulation
was not adequate for such studies due to the approxi-
mations made.

The result of the simultaneous reduction of the
secondary salt flow rate in all four secondary loops to a
level of 10% of full flow (the assumed level of auxiliary
pumping power) at a rate of 10%/sec is shown in Fig.
8.6. The load demand was maintained constant at
100%. As in the case of loss of all primary flow to 10%,
the loss of secondary flow decoupled the reactor from
the steam system. For the case of constant load
demand, the reactor inlet temperature initially rose
about 200°F in about 60 sec. Since the load demand

remained at 100%, the reactor outlet temperature set

point remained at 1300°F. The rising inlet temperature
thus decreased the reactor power set point, and negative
reactivity was added to reduce the reactor power. The
outlet temperature control system maintained the
outlet temperature at 1300°F with a maximum varia-
tion of 30°F.

The reduction in secondary salt flow rate wuh,

constant load demand on the steam generators caused
an increase in the difference between the secondary salt
hot and cold leg temperatures. The hot leg temperature
increased, and the cold leg temperature decreased. The
cold leg temperature approached the freezing point.
~ With the loss of secondary salt flow, there was no steam
temperature control.

loss of secondary salt flow, the initial parts of the
transients in system temperatures were the ~same.
However, when the load demand was decreased, the
reactor outlet temperature set point was decreased to
1050°F for 20% load. Therefore, the reactor outlet
temperature controller began to bring the outlet tem-
perature down to 1050°F. The initial rise in reactor
inlet temperature caused a decrease in the reactor
power set point as before, and negative control reac-
tivity was inserted to bring the power down. The power
decreased to about 10% in-30 sec. The secondary salt
hot leg temperature initially tended to rise and the cold
leg to fall as before, but now the decreasing reactor
outlet temperature decreased the hot leg temperature
after its initial increase. The cold leg temperature again

‘approached its freezing point.

The loss of salt flow in the primary or secondary salt
loops decoupled the reactor system from the steam
generating system. The reactor outlet temperature
control system was able to control the reactor outlet
temperature following the loss of primary or secondary
flow with or without a subsequent reduction in load
demand. If the load demand was not reduced, the
control system maintained the reactor outlet tempera-
ture within 100°F of its design point of 1300°F. When
a reduction in load demand followed the loss of flow,
the controller brought the reactor outlet temperature
down in accordance with the accompanying reduction

 
 

 

 

 

 

in its set point (1050°F at 20% load). The reactor inlet
temperature, however, decreased well below the freez-
~ing point of the primary salt upon loss of the primary
flow, due to the increased transit time of the salt in the
primary heat exchanger, whether or not the load
demand was reduced 5 sec after loss of flow. Therefore,
upon the loss of primary flow, steps must be taken to
prevent a reduction in the reactor inlet temperature.
Decreasing the secondary salt flow through the primary

86

must be decreased to prevent a. low reactor inlet

~temperature, and the load must be reduced éufﬁciently

fast to prevent low secondary salt cold leg tempera-
tures.

Upon loss of secondary salt flow to 10%, the reactor
inlet temperature tended to increase and remain above
1050°F when the load demand was not reduced (ie.,

- constant outlet temperature set point). When the load

heat exchangers to transfer out less heat would proba-

bly be the most effective way to accomplish this,
The secondary salt temperatures also decreased upon
loss of primary flow. To prevent an undesirably low
temperature of the cold leg, the load must be reduced
sufficiently fast. Decreasing the secondary salt flow rate
to control reactor inlet temperature, as discussed above,
aggravates this situation, since the transit time of the
secondary salt through the steam generator is increased,
further lowering the secondary salt temperature, Upon
loss of primary flow, then, the secondary salt flow rate

demand (and outlet temperature set- point) was re-
duced, the inlet temperature remained above 960°F.
Some additional control action may be required to
maintain the inlet temperature above 1000 F upon loss
of secondary flow. i

Loss of secondary salt flow rate produced undesirable

~ decreases in the secondary salt cold leg temperatures.

Therefore, as in the case of loss of prifnary flow, the-
load must be reduced at a rate sufficiently fast to
prevent freezing of the secondary salt when loss of
secondary salt flow rate occurs. :

Natural Convection Effects. — The posmblhty that

‘natural convection may have influenced the heat

transfer results at low values of the Reynolds modulus
in a horizontal tube led to an attempt to obtain
coefficients for upflow and downflow in a vertically

oriented test section. Accordingly, the test element .

employed in the horizontal flow studies was repo-
sitioned vertically; it was planned to use the test section
in this orientation for studies of the effect of buoyancy

forces and later also for gas dispersion studies. Eight

preoperational check-out runs were made before

numerous salt leaks necessitated shut down of the loop.
These leaks appeared to be associated with thermal
stresses arising from repeated freezing and melting of
the salt and were likely intensified by piping rigidity
necessitated by the vertical orientation. : ‘
Results of the eight heat transfer runs (four in upflow
and four in downflow) are compared with the earlier
results for horizontal flow in Fig. 9.2. While the
measured heat transfer function

that for horizontal flow, the function for upflow is

‘about 12% lower. In the range of Reynolds modulus
over which the vertical flow results were obtained

(6000 < Ng, < 10,000), well-established criteria

_indicate that no significant effect of natural convection
should have been observed. The observed difference

between the upflow and downflow measurements is
believed to result from errors associated with fluid
temperature measurement. Discrepancies in the heat
balances.(ratio of sensible heat gained by the fluid plus
heat losses to heat generated electrically) were such as

Cover-Gas Effects. — Thus far, all tests have been run
with argon cover gas. To determine whether 2 more
soluble gas might have an effect upon. the heat transfer
coefficient, measurement will be made using helium as
cover gas. Helium is an order of magnitude more soluble
in molten salts than argon, and hence more gas
evolution would be expected from inlet to outlet. The
test section has been reoriented horizontally, and 40
new runs have been made with argon to establish that
the system is functioning properly and that the results
are consistent with those obtained earlier using the
same test section in the horizontal orientation. These
runs have covered a Reynolds modulus range from 8000
to 12,000 and a heat flux range from 100,000 to
200,000 Btu hr™* ft™2 at an average fluid temperature
of 1330°F and corresponding Prandtl modulus of about
6.0. The results agree on the average with the earlier
results to within 3%. | | o

Upon completion of studies with helium as cover gas,
we plan to investigate the effect of injecting helium
bubbles into the flowing salt directly upstream from the
test section. A water-flow mockup is being used to
evaluate possible injection techniques.

9.2 THERMOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES
J. W, Cooke '

The variablegap apparatus used to measure the
thermal conductivity of molten salts?> has been im-
proved by the addition of a heat meter to permit
comparison of the heat flowing out of the specimen
with the heat flowing into the specimen. The latter heat
flow is obtained from the current flow and voltage drop

through the main specimen heater. In Fig. 9.3 the heat

- meter is seen to consist of a 1.25-n.-diam by 4-in.dong
bar of type 347 stainless steel surrounded by two
concentric cylinders of the same material and welded to
a water-cooled stainless steel heat sink. A %,4n. gap

‘between the cylinders reduces radial heat flow.

The heat flow out of the specimen is determined from
the measured temperature gradient and the known
conductivity of the stainless steel bar. A movable
thermocouple probe in a 0,070-in.-diam hole along the
center line of the heat meter is used to measure the

axial ‘temperature gradient. Thermocouple conduction

conductivity as the probe itself. '

- Errors associated with radial heat flow in the heat
~ meter will be reduced by (1) adjusting the furnace heat -
. rate to reduce the radial temperature gradient that is

measured by a thermocouple probe in the adjacent

concentric cylinder and (2) calculating the radial heat

losses by means of a computer analysis of the axial

‘temperature gradient along the center line in terms of a

two-dimensional heat-flow model and the known

‘properties of type 347 stainless steel. The new appa-

ratus will particularly improve the accuracy of determi-

“nation of thermal conductivities of low-conductivity

specimens. By using the heat meter rather than .the

The modified apparatus will be used to study conduc-
tivities in the LiF-BeF,-ThF, system. Measurements
will begin with purified BeF, (in the solid and liquid
states) and end with purified LiF. Six binary composi-
tions (Li-Be) and several ternary mixes (Li-Be-Th) will
be examined. From these measurements we hope to
develop means for estimating the conductmty of other
molten fluoride salt mixtures of these constituents with
the same certainty but with less effort and cost than
‘would be required for detailed  experimental
measurements. ‘ | S

T S Kress

The ‘apparatus was operated successfully after some
modification necessitated by results of shakedown tests,
and the instrumentation was calibrated. Preliminary
tests were made to determine the characteristics of the
helium bubbles produced by the bubble generator,*
including effects of liquid flow rate, gas flow rate, and
addition of a surface-active agent. Satisfactory bubbles
were produced within the desired diameter range, but
independent control of bubble size was not obtained.

The size depended strongly on liquid flow rate, moder-

ately on probe position, and weakly on void fraction.

ally to establish the bubble-diameter distribution shown
in Fig. 9.5. These data, replotted on a log-normal

_ probability graph, are presented in Fig. 9.6, which

indicates that a log-normal function does indeed satis-
factorily describe the distribution.

‘The preliminary tests also served to estabhsh the
operating limits of the system. It was determined, for
example, that experiments can be carried out within the
following ranges of the primary variables: )

Other variables and ranges of interest include test

section diameters (2 and 1.5 in.), test section orienta-

tion (horizontal and vertical), and surfactant concen-

tration (zero or “high”). Since the magnitudes of the

prime variables are not independent of the magnitudes

| Part 3. Ch‘emis/try

The chemical research and development efforts de-
scribed below provide extensive support to the Molten-
Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) and to the develop-
ment of advanced molten-salt reactor systems. :

A substantial fraction of these efforts was devoted to

investigations of the chemistry of the MSRE fuel salt
and off-gas streams and the transport, distribution, and
chemistry of fission products in these streams, Studies
of the relation of redox potential and distribution of
~ fission products within the fuel containment system
- have continued. Investigations of fission product be-
havior have been continued with specimens removed
from the MSRE fuel circuit, with the MSRE off-gas

sampler-analyzer, with “synthetic” fuel mixtures, and

by investigation of the chemistry of molybdenum,
niobium, and ruthenium in molten fluoride mixtures.
A broad program of fundamental investigation into

the physical chemistry of molten salt systems was

maintained; from it are derived the basic data for
reactor and chemical reprocessing design. Within the
scope of these efforts is included research in solution
thermodynamics and phase equilibria, crystal chem-

istry, electrochemistry, spectroscopy, transport proc- -

esses, and theoretical aspects of molten-salt chemistry.
Effective separation of rare-earth fission products
from fluoride salt streams which contain. thorium

fluoride is the keystone to development of semicon- |

tinuous reprocessing ﬁethods of single-fluid molten-salt

‘reactors. Efforts to develop chemical separations proc-

esses for this application continue to emphasize meth-
ods which employ selective reduction and extraction
into molten bismuth containing elther lxthmm or
thorium as the reducing agent. As a consequence of
recent development of a fluoride-metal-chloride transfer
process and laboratory-scale demonstration of its effi-
cacy for separation of the lanthanide fluorides from
MSBR fuel, part of the present effort has been devoted
to quantitative verification of the chemical equilibria of
importance to newly evolving modifications of the
reductive extraction process.

The principal emphasis of analytical chemical de-
velopment programs has been placed on methods for
use in semiautomated operational control of molten-salt
breeder reactors, for example, the development of
indine analytical methods for the analysis of MSR fuels,
for reprocessing streams, and for gas streams. These
methods include electrochemical and spectrophoto-
metric means for determination of the concentration of
U?* and other ionic species in fueéls and coolants, and
adaptation of small online computers to electro-
analytical methods. Parallel efforts have been devoted

‘to the development of analytical methods related to

assay and control of the concentration of water, oxides,

" and tritium in fluoroborate coolants.

10.1 CORROSION OF THE MSRE
FUEL SALT CIRCUIT

.~ R.E. Thoma

Completion of the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment
has demonstrated that as a container material for

denced by changes in the chromium concentration of

molten fluorides, Hastelloy N is even more corrosion .

by the MSRE fuel circuit since nuclear operations were
initiated in 1965 extends to a depth of 0,46 mil. This
value derives from revised rates based on analyses of the
chromium content of Hastelloy N heats used in the

‘fabrication’ of the fuel circuit components, for which

 

 
 

 

the average is 7.25 wt % rather than the nominal value
of 6 wt % used in previous estimates. From chemical

94

evidence accumulated in operation of the MSRE with

233Y fuel, the slight attack which has occurred seems
to be attributable to airborne contaminants introduced

into the reactor during periods when the reactor vessel :

was opened for maintenance.

A summary of the results of chemical analyses of fuel
salt samples (Fig. 10.1) shows that the concentration of

chromium in these samples increased during the initial

stages of runs 4, 8, 12, 15, and 19. During the first
period of power operation, when a significant tempera-
ture differential was imposed on the circuit for the first
time (run 4), some corrosion was anticipated as the Cr°®
+ 2UF, = CrF, + 2UF; equilibrium reaction! adjusted
to the temperature profile of the circuit. Under these
conditions the increase in the concentration of chro-
mium in the fuel salt resulted from the establishment of
the equilibrium reaction and was not a signal of the
presence of oxidizing contaminants. In each of the
“ beginning periods of runs 8, 12,15, and 19, however,
the increasing concentration of chromium in the fuel
salt was not anticipated. In retrospect, we find that in
each of these instances a common set of circumstances

existed: the reactor core vessel was opened, and test
arrays positioned within the graphite moderator lattice
were exchanged. Although reasonable measures were
adopted to minimize the possibility that airborne
contaminants might be introduced into the system
during these periods, it seems, nonetheless, that signifi-
cant amounts of oxidants were then introduced into the
open vessel,

The increase in the concentration of chromium in the
fuel salt well after run 14 began (see Fig. 10.1) seems to
be inconsistent with the premise that external contami-

"nants were the principal cause of corrosion. It may be

recalled, however, that in the period preceding run 14
part -of the graphite and metal specimens in the core
were removed and replaced. It seems quite possible,

~ therefore, that the residual concentration of reductant

which was generated within the fuel salt during run 12

~ was sufficient to offset the combined oxidizing effects

 

of whatever contamination was incurred during shut-
down and that characteristic of the fission reaction only
through the early part of run 14, and that the
subsequent rise in chromium concentration represents
the normal compensating shift in the equihbnum
corrosion reaction,

The inference that moist air was the corrosion-
inducing contaminant calls into question the efficacy of
the flush salt. As an agent for removal of adsorbed
moisture, molten LiF-BeF, flush salt is extremely

effective, as demonstrated in numerous laboratory
experiments, and should have scavenged moisture from

~ all ‘exposed surfaces. If an oxidizing contaminant or

contaminants were capable of diffusing within the
graphite, the probability of its removal by brief
circulation of flush salt might be slight; instead it might
be released into the salt gradually-after the moderator
was heated to high temperatures. Thus oxygen, rather
than water, seems.to be the most likely cause of the
observed corrosion. This conclusion is reinforced by the
fact that the scale found on the nickel cages which were
used to expose Be® to the salt during run 15 was

95

comprised preponderantly of iron, whereas on other .
occasions the principal structural metal in such scales

was chromium. Results of chemical analyses showed
that the prior fuel reprocessing treatment was effective
in reducing the concentration of chromium in the salt

* from 133 to 34 ppm, and iron from 174 to 110 ppm,

The effectiveness of the reprocessing operations in
reducing Cr** precludes the likelihood that significant
amounts of Fe?* were delivered to the fuel circuit just
prior to 233U operation. The reduction of Fe?* to Fe?

to 51.31 equivalents, or 410.5 gof 0", and corresponds
to a cumulative exposure to approxlmately 50 ft3 of
air. During 233U operations the amount of oxygen
entering the salt might have been expected to increase
the concentration of oxide by 83 ppm, in excess of the
sensitivity limits for the analytical method and well
above the concentration observed. It must be recalled
however, that early in 235U power operations the
concentration of 0?7, as measured experimentally,
declined from 120 to 60 ppm, suggesting that under
power operation 0% is partially removed from the salt
as a volatile species. It may be concluded, therefore,
that the corrosion observed in the MSRE is likely to
have been caused as described above but that the
mechanism has, as yet, not been demonstrated un-
equivocally.

The rationale proposed above has several implications
concerning the behavior of the MSRE during 233U
operations. During the first 16 hr in which fuel salt was

- circulated at the beginning of run 15, the salt did not

by Be? suggests rather that the residual iron delivered

with the purified carrier salt was oxidized after the

‘beginning of fuel circulation and that the oxidizing

contaminant was contained in the closed fuel circuit. As
increasing amounts of Be® were added to the salt
mixture, the ratio of metallic iron to chromium found
on the nickel metal cages was reduced until a normal
balance was reestablished and corrosion ceased (see
Table 10.1). o

transfer to the overflow tank and behaved as though it
contained a negligibly small bubble fraction. There-
after, Be® was introduced, and the bubble fraction
began to increase; with further exposures of the salt to -
Be® the fraction varied erratically.? Certainly the Be®
reduced the surface tension and thereby allowed easier
transport of gas from graphite to salt, followed prob-
ably by oxidation of the metallic iron impurity, which
acts as an oxidant to the circuit walls. Corrosion would
continue until the oxidants were consumed. The model

~ of corrosion proposed here has a relation to the changes

Appraisal of the premise that maintenance operations

might possibly permit the ingress of a reasonable

in bubble fraction. The corrosion data suggest that with

- respect to its physical and chemical properties, the fuel

quantity of oxygen requires the following considera-
tions. The cumulative amount of oxidation introduced .

did not achieve a reference state until the beginning of
run 17, That its bubble fraction then was greater than
observed in 23°U operations probably was related
principally to its lower density.

The equilibrium constant for the reactlon Cr® + 2UF4

- = 2UF; + CrF, varies with temperature so that under

nonisothermal conditions there is a tendency for

- chromium to mass transfer from hot to cold zones in
- the Hastelloy N container alloy. Such transfer is

‘diffusion controlled and under the relatively small

temperature differentials of the fuel circuit is regarded
as negligible in the MSRE. This tentative conclusion has
already been substantiated by examinations of the

the fact that the 235U fuel was a highly buffered

rose from 35 to 65 ppm, indicating the removal of 5.89

brief period of the subsequent run (No. 16) as well as at
the beginning of 233U power operations in run 17 (FP
164 and FP 17-2) showed the presence of 52 and 29%
25Nb inventory, respectively.

In Fig. 10.2, nominal values of [U3+]I[EU] are
shown for runs 17 to 20. These operations comprise
nearly the total power operation of the MSRE with
233y fuel. The concentrations of UF; shown in Fig.
10.2 are based on the assumption that 0.76 equivalent
of oxidation results from the fission of one atomic
weight of uranium,? and that the maximum power
achieved by the MSRE was 725 Mw(th). The equilib-
rium constant for the corrosion equilibrium Cr° +
2UF, = 2UF, + CrF, reaction at 650°C, assuming an
activity for Cr° in the Hastelloy to be 0.03,is 1.271 X

to 100 ppm. At that point the equilibrium concentra- -
tion of [U**]/[ZU] in the fuel salt anticipated from
free energy and activity data is ~0.5%. : '

‘The disposition of ®*Nb in the 223U fuel dunng the
initial. period- ‘of run 19 indicates that when
[U3*]/[ZU] is less than ~0.5%, Nb becomes oxidized
and enters the salt, possibly as Nb*" or Nb*, Then, as
the corrosion reaction Cr® + 2UF, = 2UF; + CiF,
proceeds to equilibrium, the [U3*]/{ZU] concentration
ratio increases, and at a' [U**]/[ZU] wvalue of 0.5%,
95Nb precipitates from the fuel salt. Two levels of
nominal U*/ZU concentration are shown in Fig. 10.2
for Nos. 17 and 18, the higher values based on the
assumption that corrosion of the fuel circuit during the
early stages of run 17 may have accounted for a
fraction of [U*]/[ZU]. The extent to which this
reaction might have contributed to the total concentra-
tion of UF; in the fuel at the beginning of run 17 is
obscure, because the MSRE was operated at full power
at the inception of run 17. Power operation deposits

- the noble metal fission products on the surface of the
Hastelloy N and should cause the activity of Cr° at the
alloy surface to be effectively reduced. The beginning
period of run 19 is not analogous, for not until the
corrosion equilibrium was established was the reactor
operated at full power for sustained periods.

Disposition of ?*Nb is indicated by the data points in
Fig. 10.2. It is evident that when the [U**]/[ZU] of
the 233U MSRE fuel was poised at ~0.5%, disposition
of ®>Nb toward solution in the salt or deposition
within the reactor was at a null point. If chemical
transport of °*Nb in the MSRE proceeded as Nb”* (in
salt) = Nb® (on metal or graphite) and if changes in the
oxidation number of niobium were caused by the
reaction Nb”* + nUF; = Nb® + nUF,, then

UNp© (NU'F..'“U F

Thus, at any given ratio of UF, to UF;, Nb should have
behaved identically in either 235U or 233U fuel
because for low concentration the activity coefficients
for U* and U* should not have differed appreciably.
Although there were. occasions during 23° U operations
when the [U**]/[ZU] fraction was less than 0.5% and
this inference might have been tested, this period
preceded- that in which techniques for obtaining
representative samples of the salt had been developed
successfully. The presence of Nb was not observed, but
- as shown in Fig. 10,2, freeze valve samples were
obtained mostly after the [U*]/[ZU] concentration

 
 

 

 

had been increased to values =0.5%. As noted below, it
seems more likely that in its reduced form niobium is
stabilized by reactions which produce other species
than or in addition to niobium metal. Recent labo-
ratory experiments (Sect. 11.3) suggest as well that
reduction of niobium n+ from salts does not result in
the deposition of metallic niobium.

Preliminary results of laboratory expenments con-

productlon and would possibly serve as an accurate
indicator of the power produced.
About 600 g of plutonium was produced dunng

~ power operations with 235U fuel. Thereafter, addi-

ducted by C. F. Weaver (see Sect. 11.4) indicate that -

under mildly oxidative conditions niobium assumes an
" oxidation number of ~3.6. During run 15, when the
oxidation potential of the fuel salt was sufficiently high
to permit Fe?* to exist in the salt in significant
concentrations, nearly all of the ®5Nb inventory of the
fuel salt was in solution, whereas in subsequent opera-
tions when the oxidation potential was less, no more
than ~50% of the ®SNb was found in the salt. This
behavior would be explained if, when niobium is
deposited on the moderator graphite, it reacts to form

" niobium carbide and if, under the various redox regimes

‘which have been established in the MSRE during runs
17 to 20, niobium carbide has not been removed from
the moderator graphite. The prevalence of niobium as
-the carbide is compatible with the experimental obser-
vations noted by Cuneo and Robertson,® who found
that the concentration of ?SNb at all profiles in three
different types of graphite was greater than would have
been anticipated if after deposition the motope
remained as the metallic species.

10.3 POWER OUTPUT OF THE MSRE BASED
ON THE ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION OF PLUTONTUM

R.E. Thoma B. E. Prince

~ In the MSRE, fluid fuel was circulated at rates which

were sufficiently rapid with respect to changes in the
isotopic composition of the fissile species that the salt
samples removed from the pump bowl were representa-
tive of the. circulating stream. This characteristic of
moltensalt reactors makes it possible to use the results
of isotopic analyses for a variety of purposes. One
potential application, that of appraising the cumulative
power generated by the MSRE at various periods,
became apparent with the initiation of 233U opera-
tions, for with 222U fuel the isotopic composition of
the plutonium inventory (produced partly by that
generated in 235U operations as well as from that
added later) would change significantly during power

tional plutonium was introduced into the fuel salt as a
contaminant of 7 LiF-233UF, enriching salt and later to
replenish the fissile inventory of the MSRE during
233y power operations. In the interim since a pre-
liminary attempt was made to use isotopic dilution
methods to compute the power output of the MSRE,}
calculated values for the average reaction cross sections
for a number of the cations in the MSRE fuel salt were
revised using post-1965 data.? These values showed that
the plutonium production rate during 23°U operations
was greater -than previously anticipated and, cor-
respondingly, that the relative changes in 24%Pu and

'239py during 233U operations were also slightly

different.

Estimates of the variation of 23°Pu and 240Py during
recent power operations require that the quantity and
composition of the initial plutonijum inventory be .
known accurately. As noted previously,! attempts to
determine the concentration of plutonium in the fuel
salt from gross alpha count measurements were not very
satisfactory . because of the high specific activity of
238py, An improved estimate of the plutonium in-
ventory of the system was made from extrapolations of
the observed changes in 23°Pu and 2*°Pu in the
beginning stages of power operation with 233U fuel.

- The initial 24°Pu/?3?Pu concentration ratio was com-

puted to be 0.0453, with the plutonium of the reactor
at that point as 568 g, ~2% more than estimated from
previous analyses. Current estimates of inventory values
have been computed for this revised starting inventory.
The values obtaining at the time the samples were taken
were based on estimated average values for the rates of
change of 23°Pu and 2‘"’Pu in the penod between
samples. .

Samples of the MSRE fuel salt were submitted
routinely for determination of the isotopic composition
of the contained fissile species. Comparisons of the

results of plutonium assays with nominal values which

should result from operations at various power levels

from ~7 to 8 Mw were made. Within this range, best

agreement between calculated and experimental values
was obtained for 2 maximum power output of ~7.40
Mw(th). A comparison of calculated and observed

values for the isotopic composition of plutonium which
should result from a2 maximum power output of 7.40
Mw is shown in Table 10.2 and Fig. 10.3. Agreement
tests indicate that the standard deviation between
_ calculated and observed values is +0.63% and that the
average positive bias in the experimental data is 0.093%.
On this basis the maximum power output was 7.41 +
0.05 Mw(th). The precision of this value seems to be
adequate for related analyses of reactor operations.

It is considered unlikely that further refinements in
cross-section data for the plutonium isotopes will
require any substantial changes in the calculated
inventories used for this comparison. However, for the
purpose of estimating “uncertainty” in the combined
cross-section data and neutronic model used to cal-
culate reaction rates, an equivalent of 2% in the power
output is judged conservative. Any further improve-
_ ments in the data, model, or computing approximations
used in the analysis which have significant influence on
these results will be reported at a later date,

10.4 ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION OF URANIUM
DURING 233U OPERATIONS

R.E. Thoma

For operation of the MSRE with 2 33y f_uél, estima-
tion of the power output of the MSRE from measured
changes in isotopic composition of the fissile material is

achieved with considerably greater precision from
analyses of plutonium than from uranium. This arises
from the fact that the rate of change in the relative
fraction of the most abundant isotopes for plutonium,
239py and 24°Py, is some four times that for the
uranium pair, 233U and 234 U. Analyses of the isotopic
composition of uranium in the fuel circuit during 233U
operations- were employed, therefore, primarily to
determine whether they afforded approximate con-
firmation of the power estimate as inferred from
plutonium data (Sect. 10.3). Calculations of the iso-
topic composition changes of the uranium in the MSRE
fuel circuit which should have accompanied operation
of the reactor at a maximum power output of 7.41
Mw(th) were made and compared with the results of
mass spectrometric analyses. The results of this com-
parison are shown in Table 10.3 and in Fig. 10.4; they
indicate that the changes observed in the isotopic
composition of the uranium were in excellent agree-
ment with those of plutonium. '

freezing point to 709°C. We used the capillary depres-
sion method, not only because of its simplicity but also
to check the results reported previously.! This method
is not as precise as some others, but it is accurate within
the error limitations. The equipment was similar to that

described previously except for the following changes:

Only three capillaries, % in., %, in., and % in., in
diameter, were used. These were drilled in a carbon
plunger which fitted closely into a carbon crucible. The
whole assembly was in a low-attenuation furnace so
that they could be x radiographed. The holes and the

rather irregularly shaped salt well were placed so that a

maximum amount of salt ¢ould be used without having
any of the configurations casting a shadow on the
other. An extra blind hole in the carbon plunger
contained a calibrating wire to allow us to measure
magnification and to compensate for film shrinkage (see
Fig. 10.5). ,

An absolute value of the surface tension determmed
this way depends on an accurate measure of the contact
angle A commonly used formula for this is:

2ycos 0 =(h +R[3)R(0;—0,)8,
where
v = surfdce tension,

. R -=radius of capillary,

= density of liquid, |
0,= density of vapor,
g= accéleration of gravity,
@ = contact angle, |
h = height of capillary depressmn or rise.

This assumes that the surface is hexmsphencal
Further refinements (Sugden, Schroedinger)? are out-
side the limits of error here and are not even applicable

_since they have been worked out for capillary rise

phenomena. As the construct of Fig. 10.6 shows, the
ratio of the radius of the capillary to the radius of
curvature of the meniscus is equal to the cosine of the
contact angle, provided the meniscus is hemispherical.
The radii can be measured (#5%) from the x-ray
shadowgraph. In this work the cosine of the contact |
angle so determined is 0.875, which does not agree very
well with values previously obtamed in sessile drop
measurements (0.77).

We were able to measure capillary depression and
contact angle on fuel salt, giving the followmg empirical
equation:

v =(237 i‘l‘o-)-,'" (0.08 + 0.01)¢ dynes/cm

where ¢ is in degrees centigrade. For Li,BeF, the

shadowgraph was too faint to allow an accurate

measure of the contact angle, but using the same value
obtained with fuel salt we get

Y= (245t 5) — (0.12 + 0.01)¢ dynes/cm.

We found that allowing the salt to freeze in the
capillaries would give results about 4 to 6% low.
Reducing the fuel salt melt with metallic zirconium and
with metallic lithium (each dosage calculated to reduce
10% of the uranium present) failed to change meas-
urably either the contact angle or the capillary depres-
‘sion. -

11. Fission Product Behavior

11.1 EXAMINATION OF THE FOURTH SET OF
SURVEILLANCE SPECIMENS FROM THE MSRE

F.F.Blankenship E.L.Compere S.S. Kirslis

11.1.1 Radiochemical Anatyses of the Graphite

Details regarding samples, sampling procedures, and
examination have been given previously,! along with
results on short-lived fission products. All of the data
on graphite are summarized in Table 11.1 for salt-
soluble products and in Tab]e 11.2 for metallic fission
products. '

Some of the salt-soluble products have rare-gas
precursors and enter the graphite by diffusion through
the gas in the graphite pores. The resulting deposition
profiles are like those in Fig. 11.1. Products with
longer-lived precursors, such as 51-day 3°Sr and 29-year
137Ce, have flatter profiles because the krypton or
xenon penetrates deeper before decaying. Correspond-
ingly, the ‘slopes for 58.8-day °'Y and 12.8-day '*°Ba
are steeper because of the shorter half-lives of the
gaseous precursors. The half-lives of the precursors are
listed in Fig. 11.1. Sometimes, even for the same
element, a sharp turnup is found at the surface and
sometimes not; this is not understood.

To a first approximation, because the fuel does not
wet graphite, salt-soluble fission products were not
expected in the graphite, and in general the amounts
actually found there were trivial. As expected, the
highest amounts were found for those species entering
the graphite as gases. The amount of 3°Sr is about
twice the amount found previously.

The presence of other salt-soluble species in the
graphite could probably be attributed to the existence
of a gas-borne mist of salt that has been found to be
associated with the radioactive fuel. This mist was
presumed to have entered the graphite pores. If this
were the mechanism, then the percents of inventory of
95Zr and '*%Ce in the graphite should be the same,

Unfortunately, there is too much scatter in the data to
warrant a firm conclusion on this point.

The effect of 76,000 Mwhr of exposure as compared
with 20,000 was especially pronounced for the 29-year
137Cs and is explained by the long half-life. -

Since flush salt was not used on these samples, in
contrast with past practice, it was of interest to note
whether there was an increase in fission products in the
graphite. Inspection of Table 11.1 shows that, in
general, for this class of products, there was not a large
increase and indeed the change was in the opposite
direction for **®Ba and ***Ce.

Some small fraction of these products was deposited
in the graphite by fission recoil. This would tend to
show up as high values for the samples at 34", in. from
the bottom of the core as compared with samples from
the bottom and top. In general such an effect was not
consistently recognizable for this class of products.

The percent of *3'I tended to run higher than that of
95Zr or' 1*4Ce, for examiple, because some of the *3!1
entered the graphite as a tellurium precursor.

The results on metallic fission products given in Table
11.2 show that the lack of use of flush salt did not
result in an increase in activity found on the graphite.
The percents, based on calculated - inventories, were
higher, however, than for the salt-soluble products.

Also, higher values were frequently found on graphite |

samples near the middle of the core, where the flux was
highest. This tendency had sometimes been encoun-
tered previously.? The effect of longer exposure time
was noticeable for 35-day ?SNb, 367-day '°SRu,

986-day '2°Sb, 34-day '*°Te, and 3.25-day '32Te,

but not for the other metals. This effect was qualita-
tively in accord with our expectations for ruthenium
and antimony, but not for the shorter-lived products
such as niobium and the telluriums, Also, the telluriums
showed atypical profiles. Figure 11.2 illustrates a
typical profile. There seemed to be a high-capacity,
slow process that accounted for deposition near the
surface where the profile is steep. High capacity in this
sense means accessibility to a large population of fission
product atoms. This process could have been solid or
volume diffusion through the graphite or intercrystal-
line diffusion. Fission recoil undoubtedly caused some
of the deposition in the first 30 p.

Farther into the graphite, the position and slope of
the typical profile correspond to a low-capacity, fast
process. This could be diffusion through the gas or on
the surface of the pores in the graphite. Throughout the
study of fission- product behavior in the MSRE, a
surprising amount of metallic product activity has_been
found in the gas space in contact with fuel. There is no

reason that gas in the pores of the graphﬂe should be -

dlfferent

In some instances the metals appear to be a smoke ‘

are born an atom at a time and fail to nucleate
(homogeneously) in the bulk liquid. Reaching a solid
surface, they nucleate heterogeneously; reaching a gas
surface, they pass into the vapor phase at a tremendous
supersaturation. In the gas phase, nucleation is easier
because rates of diffusion are much greater. If the mist

viewpoints may not be as much at variance as they

- that at the tracer level ?5Nb passes into the gas phase

independent of the salt mist. Some of the most recent

data indicate that the metals can ride the salt mist (cf.
Sect. 11.2) and that they are somehow highly concen-
trated in the mist as compared with the concentration
in the fuel. According to the first viewpoint, the metals

Figures 11.3 and 11.4 show the profiles for the
telluriums. The steeply descending portion of the
profile near the surface is greatly foreshortened, and the .
inner portion is steeper than for typical species. The
bend between the two slopes is much sharper than for
typical species. This suggests that the fast, low-capacity
mode of migration is accentuated exceptlonally in the

case of tellurium,

One outstanding difference from previous results was
the relatively small amount of ?5Nb; it was down by a
factor of 7 or more. This was thought to be a result of

operating with .the fuel in an oxidizing condition, that

is, with low UF;, so that the stable state was not the
metal but a niobium cation.

11.12 Radiochemical Analyses of Fission
Product Deposition on Metal

The first two times that the surveillance assemblies
were removed from the MSRE, metal samples were

obtained by cutting the perforated cylindrical Hastelloy

N basket that held the assembly. The next two times

Y-in. tubing that had held dosimeter wires was cut up

‘to provide samples. When the tubing was first. used,
lower values were obtained for the deposition of fission
products. After the fourth assembly was removed, the
basket was no longer of use, and could again be cut up
to see if the difference in deposition was due to the
deference in samples. '

~ Because the basket samples were exposed for 50,000
hr, as contrasted with 20,000 for the tubing samples,

~ only the short-lived isotopes are suitable for compari-

son. Among the isotopes listed in Tables 11.3 and 11.4,
this rules out 367-day ! °®Ru, 986-day ' 2*Sb, 284-day
144Ce, and 10,958-day '37Cs, which would be high
because of the longer exposure. For the remaining
isotopes, the basket samples are indeed higher, but by
widely varying factors. This variation was not under-
stood and seemed greater than could be ascribed to
experimental errors. The tubing samples were taken at
seven equally spaced locations from the top to the
bottom of the core. Our notion was that turbulence
might influence the deposition and that basket samples
experienced the greatest turbulence. An increased depo-
sition in turbulent regions had been possibly indicated
by the gamma spectroscopy of the MSRE fuel circuit.

Except for '3'1, the agreement between the new
averages and the previous ones, as shown in Table 11.3,
was deemed fair, Thus a consistent effect of not using

flush salt was not found for salt-soluble products. For
the salt-soluble products the tendency for deposition to -

be highest where the flux was highest is apparent, and,
except for !311, the amounts found were low enough
to be of little importance. The '?'I count was about
twice the amount that could be attributed to the
tellurium precursor, based on the assumption that the
total inventory of tellurium deposited on metal and
remained in place during decay.

With respect to the metallic fission product results in

Table 11.4, a decrease in the amount of °*Nb was

encountered for the same reason that was mentioned in
connection with **Nb in the graphite. N
In general, greater deposition is found toward the

-bottom of the core than toward the top. Last time, the

profile for metals was usually more uniform, but

-occasional decreases toward the top were noted.

Among the five cases suitable for comparing the

effect of not using flush salt, ®*Mo was lower on the

unflushed sample, '°*Ru and '3?Te were virtually

unchanged, and ''*Ag and !2°Te were higher on the
unflushed samples.

11.1.3 Fission Product Distribution
in the MSRE

It is not possible, from measured deposition in the
center of the core, to draw any firm conclusions about
deposition throughout the circuit. However, to gain
some inkling about what the numbers mean, an exercise
of some interest is to ask what would be the deposition
throughout the reactor if the méasured samples were
assumed to be’ representative. Such a hypothetical
distribution is presented in Table 11.5; it is based on
the fourth set of surveillance samples.

The most objectionable feature of the table is the
large unaccounted balance for the metallic products.
The amount that can be accounted for by escape to the
gas phase is now believed to be of the order of a few
percent. The trouble probably lies mainly in the fact
that figures for deposition of metals obtained from the

metal are very small, and, since the deposition is by

fission recoil, vanishingly small amounts should be on

the metal outside the core. - '
Except for °Nb, which forms a very stable carbide,

- more of the metallic products are on the metal than in

graphite, even though the area of the metal is smaller.
Exposures for this and all the other surveillance
assemblies' :*~> have been based on several different

values for the full power of the reactor. Using 7.25 Mw

core samples are probably lower than what is actually

deposited on the heat exchanger.
Other features of the table are more believable. The
salt-soluble fission products are undoubtedly mainly in

the salt; the spread in the numbers showing this reflects .

correctly the reproducibility of  the measurements
involved. Also, there are only a few percent of metals in

. the salt.

fission product inventories were frequently based on 8

differences from earlier figures for percents of inven-
tory. Such differences are thhm the experimental
error.

11.2 FISSION PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION IN
MSRE PUMP BOWL SAMPLES

E.L.Compere E.G. Bbhlmami

MSRE run 19 extended from August 11 to November
2, 1969, including over four days of flush salt opera-
tion, During this period we caught (for fission product
analysis) 2 flush salt and 13 fuel salt samples and 23 gas
samples (including 1 postdrain sample and 3 controls
which were sealed at the upper end of the nozzle
regxon) 2 of the gas sample capsules had ﬁne metal
filters over the nozzles.

Run 20 extended from November 26 to December
12, 1969. Two salt samples and four gas samples (with
nozzle filters) were obtained during this run; one of
these was taken after the fuel was drained, and one was
reserved for recovery of cesium isotopes by J. J.
Pinajian of the Isotopes Division.

Data from the samples from runs 19 and 20 are
presented below.

Sample Capsules. — Sample capsules were of the
double-wall type! to minimize contamination, a par-
ticularly important consideration for gas samples. A
sketch of the capsule is given in Fig. 11.5,

The salt sample capsule volume was 7. 8 cm?; for gas
- samples, volumes of 15.0 and 13.8 cm® were more
frequently used.

Sampling Procedure. — The capsules for salt samples

were lowered into the pump bowl spray baffle so that .

the nozzle was as far as possible below the salt surface.
" It remained in salt for 60 min, more than five times as

111

long as bench tests showed was required to soften the

solder holding the plug. The capsule was then lifted 18
in. which brought it into the sampler entry tube, and
was held there for 20 min before proceeding with

removal. During the entire sampling interval, a purge’

flow of helium amounting to about 575 std cm®/min
~ was maintained down the sample transfer tube.

For gas samples in runs 19 and 20 the sample capsule
was normally lowered to a depth that brought the
nozzle to about 2 in. above the liquid surface. Usually,
a period of 20 to 40 min was allowed in the pump
bowl. The purge flow of helium down the sample

‘transfer tube was held to ~75 std ¢m®/min for all of

the gas samples but the first four,
After transfer to the High Radiation Level Analytical
Laboratory, the sample tube was examined and

- weighed, and the nozzle tip was abraded until the inner

capsule was free. For samples with a filter over the
nozzle, the filter was first cut off with a tubing cutter.
Then, after the inner capsule was free, the upper part of
the outer nickel tube was cut off using a tubing cutter
and the inner capsule dumped into a new dissolver. For
gas samples in run 19, after the inner capsule was
caught in a plastic bag, the nozzle part of the capsule

. was sawed off and analyzed separately.

3U Operation ORNL-

The outer nickel tube was dissolved for analysis,
sometimes after one or more prior acid leaches. The
inner capsule and nozzle were dissolved in 2 N HN03
with suitable traps.

necessary, and none was made, for fuel burnup or the
addition of plutonium fuel. (The yields of 1°¢Ru and a
few other isotopes would be somewhat increased by the
added plutonium.)

In order to obtain a sultably continuous and detailed .

~ power history of the MSRE, during 233U operation the

' Data pertaining to salt were generally expressed as

amount (disintegrations per minute, micrograms etc.)
per gram of salt, and data for gas samples could be
expressed as amount per cubic centimeter of sample
volume. In this way the values could be compared with
appropriate inventory values or production rates calcu-
lated from the associated MSRE operations.

Inventory. — The inventory value for a given isotope
is the total amount of the isotope that existed in the
circulating fuel at a given time as a result of the power
history (and drains) of the MSRE divided by the
amount of fuel salt circulated. It accounts for all
production and decay in the fuel since the first power
operation with 235U in January 1966 and assumes no
losses. However, the inventory of niobium was arbi-
trarily set at zero at the end of the chemical reduction
operations that were part of the August 1968 fuel
reprocessing; subsequent sample data established the

different levels of operating power were recovered daily
from fission chamber charts which were calibrated from
time to time by heat balance calculations. Since no
appreciable or long-term deviation developed between
fission chamber and heat balance values, no adjustment
for such deviation was made. However, the inventory
values are proportional to the nominal full power of the
MSRE, and adjustments changing full power to 7.25.
Mw from 8 Mw have been made where suitable. In
comparing observed isotope data with inventory, it
should be recalled that the part of operating power
history reflected in the inventory of a given isotope
depends on the decay rate of the isotope in question;

the inventory for an isotope such as 3.25-day !32Te
reflects only the most recent several days, while that of
30-year '37Cs is determined by the entire history since
startup.

If an observed dwmtegratxon rate per gram (dlS min~

g™!) is divided by inventory (dis min ~* g™"), the ratio
is dimensionless and indicates what fraction of the
average possible amount is present.

If the mass of sample is not available, dividing
observed values by inventory values provides an indica-
tion of the corresponding number of grams of “inven-
tory” salt. This is most useful with salt-seeking isotopes

Gas samples require a different basis of comparison.
Assuming that no accumulation occurs, the maximum

the amount of an isotope or element that should be

single-decay model, ignoring all precursors, without
introducing appreciable error. For the daughter isotopes
in the ?!'Sr'Y,
couples, the two-element parent-daughter decay model

Fission yields of 23sU were used for operation with
that fuel and were changed appropriately when 233U

given volume Qf gas would be given by MSRE fission
rate times fission yield of chain divided by the MSRE

pump bowl purge flow rate. This can be multiplied by

9SZr9$Nb and 147Nd 147Pm |

the isotope decay constant to obtain production in
disintegrations per minute per cubic centimeter. When
divided into an observed amount, if a valid sample was
taken, the result would indicate what fraction of
production was gas-borne in the pump bowl gas.

In the case of rare-gas fission products and their
daughters, it is possible to estimate the maximum
amount that might be transferred as gas into the pump
bowl. Comparison with observed values can help estab-

lish whether valid samples of pump bowl gas were

taken.

A ' mathematical model perrmtted calculatlon of
steady-state values for a number of pertinent isotopes,
This model took into account the flow around the
 

 

circuit, the production and decay of rare-gas precursor
and rare gas, the liquid and gas flows into the pump
bowl, and decay of the rare gas in the pump bowl. Slug
flow was assumed in all regions, except the pump bowl

gas was regarded as being completely mixed. Complete -

stripping of all rare gas from the liquid entering the
pump bowl was assumed. A calculation involving about
90 iterative cycles gave steady values, Typical results are
shown in Table 11.6.

It may be seen that for the 89 chain, only 96% of the
89Gr has a 3%Kr precursor, and of this, under typical
conditions, 61% of the original chain decays before it
enters the pump bowl and 35% of the original chain
enters the pump bowl. The holdup in the pump bowl
permits 21% of the original chain to decay to ®*?Rb
atoms, which doubtless leave the gas phase as soon as a
surface is encountered, whether salt, mist, or metal. The
average 2 Kr content of the well-mixed pump bowl gas
and that of the effluent off-gas are the same, amounting
in this case to 14% of the original chain, Thus, except
for salt mist or deposited or entrained ®?Rb or 27 Sr
atoms produced by 3?Kr decay in the pump bowl, the
highest value we could expect for ®?Sr in the pump

. bowl gas is 14% of production; !37Cs is similar. The

isotopes *!Y and !*°Ba, which have rare-gas precursors
of shorter half-life and also about 40% of the chain
yield produced by direct yield of rare-gas daughters, can
have only 0.07-0.16% of production in this way; and
141Ce is essentially negligible as a gas-borne spécies.

terms of concentration, mg/g and dis min™ g™, and

the ratio of the amount found to the calculated
inventory. The salt constituents inventories were based
on the recorded additions to the system, and the
radioactive isotopes inventories on the 222U yields and
conventional equations involving power history and
decay; full power was taken to be 7.25 Mw. Since the
data sometimes scatter considerably, the medians and
+25 percentile ranges are given at the bottom of the
table. Evaluations of these and other data are continu-
ing, but the following observations can be made at this -
time. o :

Salt Constituents. — In order to minimize contamina-
tion the inner copper capsule containing the salt sample
was dumped directly from the opened outer capsule
into a new glass dissolver as soon as it was free of the
outer capsule, with no contact with manipulators or

‘other cell equipment. This meant that the solution

analyzed contained substantial amounts of copper ion,
interference from which probably accounts for the
relatively low values obtained for the uranium concen-
tration by coulometric titration. Except for the 233U
by activation analysis our data here scatter rather more
than the results from ladle samples; this is, at least in
part, attributable to the presence of the copper ion and
a less precise determination of the sample weight:
different balances were used outside of and in hot cell,

.sample weight is the difference between two relatively

large numbers, material on the outer capsule would
count as sample weight. Such considerations, however,
do not satisfactorily explain the considerable scatter
and biases shown here for constituents and fission
products. The analyses were run in duplicate and
redone when reasonable (+10%) checks were not
obtained. Probably the explanation is that the results

~ represent the state of the art when dealing with large

numbers of extremely radioactive samples of various
kinds and origins under hot-cell conditions. This state-
ment is in no way meant to impugn the knowledgeable,
interested, and cooperative efforts of the Analytical

- Chemistry Division personnel who carried out the

analyses.

Salt-Seeking Isotopes. — The ratios to mventory for
these species scatter about 1.0, as they should. How-
ever, only the ?5Zr data are reasonably consistent and
give the right level for the median of the middle 50
percentile group of ratios to inventory. Quite aberrant
values were also obtained even for this isotope for
samples 19-9 and 19-76.

Noble Metal Isotopes, — The so-called noble metal
isotopes behaved unusually in runs 19 and 20. During
earlier operations these isotopes, with the exception of

 
 

114

®>Nb as described previously,” were found in salt
samples at concentrations equivalent to fractions of 1%

of inventory.® In runs 19 and 20, however, the noble

- metal concentrations in salt samples are often in the
range 10 to 90% of inventory.

Two points should be emphasized regardmg the noble
metal group, as shown in Fig. 11.6. The observed
activity values for the various isotopes in a sample
remdin in.a reasonably constant ratio to each other
from sample to sample when expressed in terms of

inventory, and the values of these ratios to inventory .

very seldom exceed unity in spite of the fact that the
total amount present varies by two orders of magnitude
from sample to sample.

To the extent that the different. isotopes are in
constant proportion from sample to sample; it is
indicated that the samples carry material from a
well-mixed pool of these substances. Since these rela-

tionships hold for isotopes with half-lives ranging

between 2.7 days for ®®Mo and 367 days for ' °°Ru, it
would seem that the noble metals in the sample reflect
a long period of power history, rather than bemg just
from most recent production.

The secc'md point argues that the samples reflect what
is borne by salt rather than what is picked up as a result
of some localization in the pump bowl or sample

. region; else values should exceed unity rather readily.

It would seem to be more than a conceivable
coincidence to have such a preponderance of the values |
for percent inventory found to be in 2 realistic range.

hailf-lives, ‘also suﬁport the a'tg'ilment.‘that the s'amples ’

are “real.” A somewhat disturbing point in this regard,
however, is the wide fluctuation in concentration
observed in samples taken within a short span of time.
Thus samples 57 through 59 were all taken over a
period of 6% hr, and the noble metal concentrations

vary between one and two orders of magnitude. No -

satisfactory correlation of noble metal concentration
and any operating parameter is apparent thus far.

These - results suggest the following about the noble
metals in the MSRE,

1. The bulk of the noble metals remain accessible in

the circulating loop, but with widely varying
amounts in circulation at any particular time. -

2. In spite of this wide variation in the total amount
found in a particular sample, the proportional
composition is relatively constant, indicating that
the entire inventory is in substantial equlhbnum
with the new material being produced.

3. The mobility of the pool of noble metal material
suggests that deposits occur as an accumulation of
ﬁnely divided, well-mixed matenal rather than as a

“plate.” ‘

Examinations of the data are continuing. Of most .

recent interest is the use of the ruthenium and tellurium
isotope pairs to study the history and behavior of this
material. Preliminary use of this tool, however, has

revealed the necessity for refining our inventory calcu-.

lations and rechecking obvious discrepancies in the
analytical results.
Niobium-95. — The analyses indicate that appreciable

. percentages of the *SNb were dissolved in the salt in

samples 199, 19-24, and 20-1. The above observations -

on the noble metals in general raise a question about
such .a conclusion being justified in all cases, however.

Thus, in samples 19-24 and 20-1 comparable per-

centages of all the noble metals were present in the salt.
As a consequence the ®SNb present may have been
associated with the other noble metals rather than being
in solution. In view of this possibility, a review of the
niobjum data will have to be carried out. A complica-
tion in this regard is the fact that the *SNb is the
daughter of ®%Zr, which is present in large quantities in

 

 

sffiﬁbing ‘of the *°Kr and '*"Xe pre'curso“rs‘ in the

pump bowl. The general scatter of the results for these

isotopes, however, suggests that this may be coinci-
dental.

Gas Samples. — Data for gas samples from runs 19
and 20 are shown in Table 11.8. In this table, the total
amount (as disintegrations per minute) for a given
isotope is shown for capsule and nozzle regions. The
ratio of each value to salt inventory is also shown,

indicating in micrograms the amount of inventory salt

that would correspond to the observed activity.,

Examination of wvalues for salt-seeking isotopes
implies that significant quantities of salt are found in
both nozzle and capsule regions. The values for the
various salt-seeking isotopes in a given region of a
sample are similar, which is consistent with an entrain-
ment of salt mist. The amounts of such mist in each
region of each sample were estimated by averaging the
microgram values indicated by appropriate salt-seeking

isotopes and constituent elements. Comparison with

other isotopes in the given region of the sample
indicated quite generally that the gas samples were

considerably enriched, relative to salt, in daughters of
rare gases, noble metals, and tellurium-iodine isotopes,

all of which are missing to some extent from subsurface
salt samples. -

However, gas data must be examined in terms of the

amounts of material per unit volume of gas, both
including and excluding any contribution of salt mist. -

Such data should then be compared with MSRE
production rate - per unit- purge gas flow rate to
determine the fraction of production indicated to be

transported into the off-gas system, This was done by
taking the amounts of each nuclide found in the nozzle
and inner chamber, dividing by capsule volume, and
comparing with production per unit volume of off-gas.
The range and average of such gross values are shown in
appropriate columns of Table 11.9.

It is also of interest to see what substances, if any,
were to any extent transported independently of salt

. mist, possibly as gases. To do this we have noted that

salt samples, necessitating large corrections in the *>Nb

results to arrive at the actual amount present at sample
time. As can be seen in the table, this often leads to
negative values,

Isotopes with Noble-Gas Precursors — The slightly
low median ratios to inventory for °Sr and !37Cs are
in surprising agreement with the expected (10 to 20%)

the volume of the nozzle tube was negligible. We
thereby assumed that the nozzle deposits were largely
mist and assign the composition of the nozzle region to
capsule mist substance. The amount of a given isotope

~ assigned to the capsule mist is consequently determined

by the amount in the nozzle region of the sample and’

by the relative weights of “salt” in capsule and nozzle

regions, Such salt weights were averages of values for

this region of the sample, as indicated by appropriate
salt-seeking isotopes and constituent elements.

9Gross includes capsule plus nozzle isotopes,

bNet includes capsule isotopes only, less proportional quantity of material of nozzle composition, for the given sample,

A net gas-borne value for the capsule was then

calculated by subtracting the capsule mist contribution.

from the observed value and, as usual, dividing by
capsule volume. This net value could then be ratioed to
the isotope production rate per unit purge flow rate as
before. The range and average of such values are given
in Table 11.9.

It is evident from this table that #?Sr and 13"Cs

- which would presumably exist as 3°Kr and '37Xe at

the time of sampling, are present in net amounts of the
proper magnitude if valid gas samples are assumed.
Since salt mist of nozzle composition has been sub-
tracted, it appears legitimate to accept the samples in
general as being acceptable samples of the gas regxon
within the pump bowl spray baffle.

. Insofar as the material in the shielded region repre-
sents the pump bowl gas in general and the gas entering

the off-gas line in particular, the data of Table 11,9 also
indicate the following: The gross amounts of “noble
metal” isotopes carried by the off-gas are in general a
low few percent of production (though ' °®Ru appears

higher, in part because the high yield from 23° Pu in
the fuel was not taken into account). Much but not all
of this appears to be associated with salt mist, but some
carries through into the -net value, indicating additional
noble metal transport independent of salt mist.

Further, the tellurium isotopes also are found only to
the extent of a low few percent; however, essentially all .

‘of these appear to follow the salt mist, so that net

quantities tend to approach zero. It then appears likely
that noble metal isotopes and tellurium isotopes could
be separately transported to some extent.

These data are ratioed to production rate and imply
steady-state conditions and short holdup periods in any
region; the simple behavior model thus assumed appears
stralghtforwatd reasonable, and adequately conserva-
tive.

However, our recent studies of activity ratios of
isotope pairs, such as '®3Ru/'°®Ru and ! *?Te/! 2°Te,
indicate that the material found in gas capsules may not
be from recent production but from a mix of it with a
presently indeterminate but nevertheless substantial

 
 

 

 

portion of the inventory from a considerable span of
the previous power history. This is consistent with the
rapid equilibration of recent production and inventory

-indicated by the salt sample noble metal analyses. To

apply such a model will require further definition of

118

For a. period of six weeks, experiments were con-
ducted with the same salt charge, and 27 salt sam-
ples were removed from the melt. The first three

~ contained anomalously high concentrations of nio-

partition of losses between off-gas and other ‘possible
“sinks,” a matter under current consideration. Present

indications are that the fraction of noble metals lost to
off-gas will not be greater than shown in Table 11.9.

Correlation of the gas sample data with possibly
relevant operating conditions is not apparent (other
than reactor power, gas flow rate, pump bowl pressure,
and temperature, which are incorporated into the value
of production rate per unit purge flow rate).

In these runs, samples 19-1 through 19-29 and 20-1
showed an appreciable fraction of the **Nb inventory
in salt samples; consequently, the fuel salt was less
reducing during this interval. However, 5Nb quantities
in gas samples gave no evident response to  this
condition of the salt. '

11.3 INVESTIGATIONS OF THE BEHAVIOR
OF FISSION PRODUCT NIOBIUM

H. W. Kohn

Laboratory investigations of the chemical behavior
of the fission products ?>Nb and ?5Zr were con-
tinued. The principal emphasis of the current efforts
was directed toward preliminary studies of the rela-
tionship of the redox potential of fluoride melts to
the distribution of these isotopes between the melts
and metal containers. All experiments were con-
ducted at 650°C. The following experimental
procedures were employed: 2.15 kg of simulated
fuel salt (Li,BeF, containing 5 mole % ZrF, and

bium, indicating that the initial zirconium-niobium
separation was not complete. All subsequent samples
were deficient in niobium, indicating behavior unlike
that observed in the MSRE. In the laboratory exper-

iments, niobium was not quickly dissolved and trans-

ferred to the melt by introduction of HF as an

‘oxidant, nor removed from the melt by metallic

total " inventory

lithium as a reductant. Instead, it behaved erratically
under varying conditions of redox potential, as is
indicated by the data in Table 11.10.

Niobium on the gas probes was low, usually less
than 1% of that formed during a sampling period
and consequently a much smaller fraction of the
in ‘the container vessel. The
®5Nb/?5Zr ratio in the gas probes was always ob-
served to be greater than the ratio in the salt,
usually a factor of 10 or so, and was higher for
oxidized melts than for reduced melts. Samples from
reduced melts exhibited increases in the ?5Nb/?5Zr
ratio with increasing gas flow rates. The amount of
salt in the probes, as judged from the zirconium

- activity, was too great to be accounted for by

vaporization. We believe it to be carried as fine
droplets. The electron microscope slides suspended
above the melt were found to be encrusted with

salt, The size of the salt particles from the melt
~ when it was in an oxidized condition was about 0.1

0.3 mole % UF,) was tagged with 6.5 mc of °°Zr

which had been freshly separated from its ?3Nb
daughter. The salt was contained in a nickel vessel,
and the apparatus was arranged so that gas samples
could be collected either by chemical probes, de-
scribed previously, or on electron microscope slides
which were positioned just above a gas bubbler tube.
The amounts of niobium and zirconium contained in
the gas sampling tubes and also on immersion speci-
mens were determined by radiochemical analysis. A
nickel—nickel oxide electrode was also used to moni-

‘tor the redox potential of the melt. Gas flow rate,

redox potential, niobium content, bubble movement,
and character of the immersion probes were the
principal variables studied. ‘

p. They appeared to have either rhombohedral out-
lines or, in addition, adhering fragments which seem-
ingly lacked morphological symmetry (Fig. 11.7a).
The salt from reduced melts, however, exhibited
dendritic or needle growth patterns and larger par-
ticle sizes (Fig. 11.7b). It should be noted that the
two photographs do not represent identical magnifi-
cations. Electron diffraction analyses of the com-
posite particles - indicated that in addition to the
fluoride salt, nickel metal and carbon particles were
present. : S

Loglog plots of zirconium and of niobium deposi-
tion in and on the probes vs flow rate were made in
order to estimate the order and rate of deposition.
Zirconium deposition, not surprisingly, was - always
found to be about first order (0.7 to 0.9). Niobium

deposition rates, though highly erratic, appear to

have a higher order rate as high as 1.4 to 4, most
probably 1.5. The actual numbers are not firm
enough to postulate mechanisms because of the inac-
curacy of the data and the small number of experi-

mental points, but it is obvious' that the niobium
-~ and zirconium enter the gas probes by different
~ order mechanisms. ' '

From the deposition' rates of niobium and zir-

conium on the outer surface of the gas sampling
probes one can calculate, assuming a constant rate

and knowing the gas deposition area of the pot and
of the probes, the amount of niobium which would

diffuse to the gas area of the pot wall. A maximum

~of 30% of that niobium formed by decay during a
sampling experiment might be so carried. Relative to

the total inventory of niobium that is present after
the experiment is under way the percent so carried
is, of course, considerably lower. From the amount
found in the gas probes and the gas flow rates one

can calculate that amount carried from the pot by
flowing gas during the experiment. This was also
low, less than 10% of the amount formed by decay
during sampling. To confirm this, the connections
and fittings downstream from the salt container were
counted at the conclusion of the experiment. About

1% of the total niobium was found thereon.

Immersion probes were pretreated by ﬁring in
hydrogen for 1 hr at 600°C followed by 15 min in
dry argon to remove adsorbed hydrogen. All probes

immersed in the melt became preferentially coated

with niobium, from § X 10% to ~105\countslmin
deposited per square centimeter per hour. It is quite
obvious that (Table 11.11) (except for nickel) de-
position from an oxidizing solution is heavier than

of the metal is not favored thermodynamically.
Autoradiographs of the immersion specimens showed
spotty areas of deposition on that part of the probe
which was exposed to the liquid. Four probes
showed autoradiographs with dark rings at exactly
the position of the interface. To show that this was
not due to a ring of radioactive salt, we cut up two
of the probes and counted the various sections. The
interface section showed the highest °3Nb/°5Zr
ratio. Two of the probes from the oxidized solution
showed a heavy uniform deposition on that part of
the probe which was exposed to the gas phase. The
upper ends of these probes (gas phase plus interface)
were at least ten times more radioactive than the
lower ends. . ' ’ :

the walls of the vessel which contacted the melt.
Such a conclusion is in agreement with the results
from the gas probes, the autoradiographs, and the
activity levels of the fittings, but does not duplicate

- the behavior observed in the MSRE.

In order to compare the behavior of the fission

niobium in the MSRE with that in the laboratory
we immersed a niobium foil in the MSRE fuel pump
bowl for 3, hr at a time when the reactor was
extremely reducing (3400 full-power hours, and
[U**]/[ZU] was nominally ~1.35%; see Sect. 10.2,
this report). The foil was weighed, placed in a nickel
cage, and after immersion and removal, leached in

- verbocit and weighed. The nickel cage and the foil
- were then dissolved, and the cage solution, the foil

Gamma autoradiographs of the pot were made

. after removal of most of the salt; these showed
preferential deposition of radioactivity (mostly
" niobjum) on that part of the salt container which
had been in contact with the salt. The bubbler tube
was also autoradiographed and showed the same
' phenomenon. The total activity found on these
pieces of apparatus accounts for 25% of the niobium
missing from- the salt samples. A count of the bub-

bling tube multiplied by the ratio of area of the salt.

‘container in contact with the liquid to the area of
the tube in contact with the liquid accounts for
160% of the missing niobium. Within the accuracy
of the counting experiments, it may be inferred that
nearly all of the niobium in the melt deposited on

solution, and the washings were counted for the
noble metal fission products as well as some of the
salt seekers. The results are shown in Table 11.12.
The first four entries show how a salt seeker, such
as 898r, 1*'Nd, or ?5Zr, materials which we would
expect to show no preferential deposition behavior,
acts and consequently show the amount of salt one
can expect to adhere to the total assembly. Except-
ing the values for 8°Sr, which seem erroneous, it
appears to be 100 to 200 mg, adhering mostly to-

~ the foil. During the experiment 12 mg of niobium

dissolved, and the niobium foil appeared corroded
and wetted by the salt. The nickel cage, on the
other hand, was bright and shiny. The data in Table
11.12 show that preferential deposition of Ag, Mo,
and Te seemed to take place on the foil and on the
 

123

nickel cage, which was in electrical contact with the
niobium foil. There seems.also to be a comparatively
slight amount of preferential niobium deposition on
the nickel cage, but this deposition is small com-

‘pared with that of Mo, Ag, and Te, and is also

incompatible with the solution of some of the
niobium. ‘ ‘

From time to time, changes in wetting behavior
appear to have been dependent on reduction poten-

‘tial of the melt. We have examined the possible

correlation of such changes with deposition behavior
of noble metal fission products. In a series of sep-
arate experiments the wetting of Nb, Ni, Mo, Cu,
and Ag in-a simulated fuel salt melt was studied as
a function of reduction potential. The wetting be-
havior was judged by examination of the contact
angle of solidified drops (if any) left on hydrogen-
fired immersion coupons introduced into the melt
without exposure to air. The degree of reduction
was estimated from the inventory of salt and from
the quantity of lithium metal added to the melt.

Wetting. was not independent of substrate. A
freshly prepared fuel salt melt, sparged with 10% HF
in hydrogen, was found to wet only the most active -
metal, Nb. This wetting behavior of Nb was asso-
ciated with a chemical attack, determined by weight
loss as well as by a pitted appearance. Mild reduc-
tion (conversion of 3.5% of the total U* to U*)
caused the melt to wet Ni, Mo and Nb without
causing corrosion, but not to wet Cu and Ag.
Stronger reduction (>5%) made the melt wetting
toward these metals. These results are consistent
with previous observations.?

The behavior described above seems to have quali-
tative relevance to the migration of niobium in the
MSRE fuel, where at slightly above and below
approximately 0.5% [U*]/[ZU] major differences in
?*Nb disposition within the fuel circuit were 'ob-
served. (Sect. 102, this report).

The results of the current study tend to mdlcate
that wetting behavior may play a significant role. in
controlling the distribution of woids and fission.

114 NOBLE METAL FISSION
PRODUCT CHEMISTRY

11.4.1 Introduction
| C F. Weaver

The unpredlctable behavior of the noble metal fis-
sion products (Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, and Te) in the
MSRE -caused us to initiate studies of their high-
temperature chemistry some time ago. Emphasis was
given to molybdenum fluoride chemistry because the
combination of fission yield and cross section for
the molybdenum isotopes poses a potential problem
in the breeding efficiency of an MSBR. To a lesser
extent the behavior of niobium and ruthenium fluo-
rides was investigated. The fluorides of technetium
and tellurium were given attention only in our litera-
ture surveys. Previously reported studies of molybde-
num fluoride chemistry, along with the reasons for
initiating this work, have been reviewed.'”?

Recent evidence that niobium metal may be
oxidized and .enter fuel salt when U**/U* ratios are
quite low suggested that this fission product might

- provide a means of monitoring the redox potential

of such a system. Consequently, increased attention

Several gram batches of MoFs, MoF,, and MoF;
were synthesized according to the procedure
reported in ref. 3. The materials are used in the
kinetic and mass spectrometric studies described
below as well as in Raman®:'° and absorption!!-12
“spectroscopy studies. A 385-g batch of NiF; was
synthesized by hydrofluorinating NiCl,-4H,0, using
a procedure developed by B. J. Sturm.!3® Nickel
fluoride is 2 mild fluorinating agent commonly used
by several groups in the Reactor Chemistry Division
to oxidize Nb metal. OQur current efforts are directed
toward the synthesis of the lower fluorides of nio-
bium by reduction of NbFs!* and from dispropor-
tionation reactions of the lower fluorides.

11.4.3 Niobium and Molybdenum Fluoride
‘Solutions in Molten Li; BeF,

C. F. Weavér H. A. Frieﬂman

A series of experiments was initiated to investigate
the reaction

Nb+xHF#Nbe+32-c-H2

in molten Li, BeF, with respect to the valence of
niobium in equilibrium with niobium metal, the
partial pressures of H, and HF as a function of
Nb** .concentration, and the stability of the NbF,
solutions in a neutral (He) atmosphere. The niobium
‘was rapidly fluorinated by the direct addition of
HF. After the Nb concentration reached 300 ppm
the system was held under flowing He (3.3 liters/hr)
for six days. No loss of niobium occurred. Hydro-
fluorination was resumed and continued until the
concentration of niobium rose to 1500 ppm. This
solution was held for 32 days under He without loss
of niobium. Sweeping the system with 1 atm of H,
(5.5 liters/hr) produced an initial burst of HF. This

syn- ,

was caused by thle' reduction of the fluorides of
impurities more noble than niobium and was fol-

lowed by a very slow evolution of HF. These results -

indicate that approximately 1.5 X 10™ atm of HF
exists at equilibrium with 1 atm of H, and 1500
ppm of Nb** in its lowest valence state in molten
Li,BeF, at 500°C, and imply as well that under
these conditions niobium is only slightly more noble
than Cr. This behavior of Nb contrasts sharply with
that of Mo under similar conditions. In a period of
32 days under He, 1500 ppm of Mo** would have
been reduced by disproportionation to 1000 ppm.
With 1 atm of H,, Mo® would be reduced as fast
as the H, entered the system. Based entirely on -
experimental information, the order of increasing

‘nobility with respect to fluorination of metals in

molten Li,BeF, is Cr, Nb, Fe; Ni, Mo, Cu, and Ru.
Information in the literature suggests that Tc is
approximately equivalent to Cu in this respect. '
‘A stronger reductant, Li metal, was used to reduce
the dissolved niobium and, hence, determine its
valence. The stoichiometry of the reaction indicated
that niobium was present as Nb 3.6 + 0.1. The
absence of concentration dependence suggests a
cluster compound, Nb;F,;. We are now repeating
this experiment at a higher initial concentration of
Nb3-¢* to improve the accuracy of the valence deter-
mination, to provide a more stringent test of con-
centration dependence, and to determine the solubil-
ity limit. At present the concentration is 2300 ppm
and has shown no variation over a period of 15

- The relative stability of this niobium fluoride and

the following reactions are not available:

excess Nb metal was hydrofluorinated into molten

tentative value of x = 3.6 + 0.1 which has shown no

Thus if 7, of 0.5 X 1072 will oxidize Nb metal,’® then
r, of 1.6 X 1075 will oxidize NbC as well as the less
stable Nb,C.'6-!7 This value of r is insufficient to
oxidize Mo metal® but may oxidize Fe, which is more
noble than Nb but less noble than Mo.

The stability studies of Mo®*" in molten Li,BeF, at
500°C were continued. It was previously reported that
a tenfold increase in the surface area of the copper
container did not affect the rate or the apparent order
of removal of Mo* from solution over a 1400-hr
period, This experiment was continued to 4500 hr,
giving the results shown in Fig. 11.8 and yielding a
half-order rate constant, defined as K = ¢t 1(C}/? —
C1/2), of 6.42 X 1072 ppm™1/2 hr™? by least-squares
analysis. It is now planned to study the temperature
dependence of the disproportionation kinetics and the
valence of molybdenum in this solvent. ,
~ An experiment was initiated to determine the effect
of graphite on the removal of molybdenum from
solution at 500°C. The preliminary results suggest that
graphite has no significant effect on the kinetics.

An atteihpt to introduce Mo** into molten Li, BeF,

- at 500°C by direct hydrofiuorination of the metal was’
: barely successful. After 18 hr of hydrofluorination,

using undiluted HF at 1 atm for the last 8 hr, only 92
ppm of molybdenum 1 was found in the filtered samples.
Again the behavior of molybdenum and njobium may
be contrasted. Niobium hydrofluorinates into molten

- Li, BeF, with ease, molybdenum with difficulty. On

the other hand, the reduction of the molybdenum

~ solutions with hydrogen occurs very rapldly, while

: 11.4.4 Mass Spectroscopy of Molybdenum
‘and Ruthenium Fluorides -

C.F.Weaver J.D.Redman

Studies of the vapors associated with the evaporation,

decomposition, and reactions of the fluorides and
oxyfluorides of niobium, molybdenum, and ruthenium

‘have continued. In addition, further efforts to refine

the pressure measurements were made.

Recently we reported® that single-crystal 7LiF and
Ag were used as pressure standards to check the
sensitivity of the time-of-flight mass spectrometer
before and after an experiment. These results improved
the reliability of our. pressure estimates from an order
of magnitude to within a factor of 2. The most severe
problem with respect to further improvement in ac-
curacy is that the corrosive noble metal fluorides cause

a deterioration in machine sensitivity during an experi- |

ment and that this decline is unlikely to be linear in
time. The feasibility of using an internal standard to
continuously monitor the machine sensitivity during an
experiment was investigated. Krypton was selected
because of its - availability, absence as a2 common

impurity, nearness in mass to materials currently under

investigation, and chemical inertness. The results were
highly encouraging, and the development of this tech-
nique will be pursued.

A surprising observation with respect to machine
sensitivity was made during direct fluorination experi-

ments. It was observed that the addition of fluorine gas
to the instrument followed by pressurizing to 1 atm
with dry nitrogen returned the machine sensitivity to its
initial value or higher. This technique will be useful in
avoiding the time-consuming machine cleaning (about
three days) after each run. It further emphasizes the
need for an internal standard, since the sensitivity may
increase as well as decrease during different steps of a
given experiment.

It was previously reported® that work is proceedmg'
toward refining the infrared adsorption spectra of
molybdenum oxyfluorides, since they exist as im-
purities in MoFs samples and, hence, complicate the
derivation of its spectrum. Efforts to synthesize the
oxyfluorides of molybdenum for this purpose led to a
study of the reaction of MoQ;(s) with MoF4(g) in a
Knudsen reaction cell. The cracking patterns for MoF,,
MoOF,, and MoO, F, have been reported earlier.!®-21’
More detailed fragmentation patterns, including doubly

_ ionized species, may be seen in Figs. 11.9-~11.11, and

was first carried out in a copper cell, which was
unsatisfactory. Although very little copper-containing
material was observed in the effusing gas, cell reaction
was indicated by mass transfer of copper, the reduction
of MoO; to MoO,, and the reduction of MoF, to
MoFs and MoF,. The reaction of the MoO; residue

The reaction of MoO;(s) with MoF4(g) was again
studied using a nickel cell. In this case no nickel-
containing molecules were observed in the effusing gas,
no mass transfer of nickel was detected, the residue was
pure MoO3, and no lower-valence fluorides of molybde-

num were seen. Since there was no evidence of
reduction of the molybdenum compounds and since
.oxidation of hexavalent molybdenum cannot occur, it

- uncertainty

is concluded that all of the oxyfluorides observed were
of hexavalent molybdenum, This resolves the earlier
1921 in assigning the MoOF, cracking
pattern and allows analysis of the products of both of
the above experiments. The composition of the effusing
gases may be seen in Fig. 11.13. Note that conditions
exist in which either pure MoO, F, or M00F4 may be
synthesized.

In earlier reports®? we have described the d1spropor-
tionation of pure RuF; in the temperature range 600 to
700°C as:

Recently the reaction of fluorine with ruthenium
metal contained in a nickel Knudsen effusion cell was
investigated. Fluorine gas was passed through the cell
over the temperature range 25 to 800°C. Below 450°C
no reaction was observed. Throughout the range 450 to
629°C the effusing vapor was a mixture of F, and

RuF,. Hence the reaction was

Ru@) + 2Fa(6) > RuFa(e) .

The simplicity of the vapor in the case of ruthenium
fluorides contrasts markedly with the analogous

“molybdenum fluorides, where MoF,, MoFs, MoFq,

Mo, Fyo, and Mo;F,s are observed simultaneously in
the vapor phase. Above 629°C, NiF, appeared in the

spectrum, while-the RuF, vapor_ pressure was observed
to be at a maximum near 675 to 700°C, as shown in

* Fig. 11.14, This behavior of nickel in the presence of

fluorine has been observed by others.2?:23 At lower
temperatures a layer of NiF, forms and protects the .
nickel substrate from further attack. In the range 620
to 700°C the NiF, desorbs, and cell corrosion occurs.
In our case the nickel appeared to react with both the
F, and RuF,, reducing the effusion of both species. No
polymers, oxyfluorides, or ruthenium fluoride frag-
ments with mass greater than RuF," were seen.

12 Properties of the Alkali Fluoroboratcs

12.1 PHASE EQUILIBRIA IN THE ALKALI METAL
FLUORIDE-METAL FLUOROBORATE BINARY
SYSTEMS: THE SYSTEM RbF-RbBF,

L. O. Gilpatrick  C. J. Barton

Investigation of the system RbF-RbBF,, which is
very nearly complete, represents an extension of studies
we have made of systems containing NaBF, and KBF,.
Differential thermal analysis was the chief technique

used in this investigation. The RbBF, used was pre- .
pared by S. Cantor using an aqueous technique, mixing

RbCl and NaBF, to precipitate the slightly soluble
RbBF,. This compound melted quite sharply at 582°C
and showed a polymorphic transition at 247°C. Rubid-
ium fluoride was used as received from a commercial
supplier except for dehydration. This material melted at
783°C, 12° below the best literature value for this
compound (795°C). . |
Equilibrium phase transition data were obtained for
ten compositions of RbF-RbBF; mixtures, and an

equilibrium phase diagram of the system (Fig. 12.1) was
constructed from the results. This system was found to
exhibit a single eutectic; it is found at 31.5 mole % RbF
and melts at 442 + 2°C, It is quite similar in this respect
to the NaF-NaBF, and KF-KBF, systems. The poly-
morphic transition of RbBF, was detectable in all
mixtures studied, and the temperature at which it

. occurred was independent of composition, showing a

‘probable absence of solid solutions. There was no
evidence of compound formation. A lowering of the
eutectic temperature in RbF-rich compositions may be
due to impurities such as hydrolysis products in the
impure RbF. This possibility is currently being investi-
gated by treating the commercial RbF with ammonium
bifluoride. '

It is apparent from Fig. 12.1 that this system does not
have a low enough melting point to be attractive for use
as a coolant salt in molten-salt reactors that are

- designed for maximum economy in conjunction with

supercritical steam generator plants.

122 SOLUBILITY OF Na,CrF, IN SODIUM
TETRAFLUOROBORATE MELTS

C. J. Barton

Green crystals of Na;CrF¢ have been observed in
corrosion test loops in which NaBF,-NaF (92-8 mole
%) salt mixtures were circulated. No data on the
solubility of this species in fluoroborate solvents exist,
but extensive studies of the solubility and stability of
chromous and chromic fluorides (Cr** and Cr*) in
several other fluoride mixtures were made in connec-
tion with the ANP program some time ago.

The compound NayCrFg was mixed with sufficient
NaF and NaBF, to give a 10 mole % mixture and a
solvent composition of 92 mole % NaBF,. The
Na;CrFs (prepared earlier by B. J. Sturm) was added in

preference to C1F; because the combination of CrF,
with solvent NaF would change the solvent composition

- significantly if CrF; were very soluble,

The procedure followed in CeF3 solubility studies
was employed in the present investigation except that
no tracer was used, and sole reliance for solubility

- measurements was placed on wet chemical analysis of

filtered samples removed with copper filter sticks. Two
sets of samples were taken because of scatter of data in
the low concentration range in the first set of samples
{open circles, Fig. 12.2). Sodium, boron, and nickel
were also determined in most of the samples to

“establish the solvent composition and possible corrosion

of the nickel container. The average of six Na and B
analyses, corrected for the Na in Na;CrF,, indicated a
solvent composition of 95 mole % NaBF, instead of the
intended 92 mole % eutectic mixture. Additional
studies will be required to establish the effect of solvent
composition on chromium solubility, but the writer
does not believe that it will be markedly different in a
92 mole % NaBF, solvent from the observed values
shown. in Fig. 12.2. Nickel values were low (20 to 30
ppm) in most samples, but two samples taken at
temperatures close to 700°C gave values of 300 and 390

ppm. The solubility varied from 0.46 mole % Na;CrF

at 700°C to 0.046 at 500°C, and extrapolation to the
eutectic melting point (384°C) shows that the solubility
would be less than 0.01 mole % at the freezing point of
the mixture., The calculated apparent heat of solution
of Na; CrF in this solvent was 17.0 kcal/mole.

12.3 PREPARATION OF PURE SODIUM
TETRAFLUOROBORATE

L. O. Gilpatrick  Ralph Apple

A 1.5kg charge of NaBF, was prepared by a dry
technique to give a product of greater purity than any
previously available. In particular, special efforts were
made to reduce the oxygen content to very low levels.

- The best material currently available shows an oxygen

content of 200 ppm or greater as measured by the
KBrF, fluorine displacement method.

A reaction vessel was constructed of welded nickel
and lined with graphite components in such a way that -
the molten salt would come in contact solely with
graphite during processing. Into this unit was placed a
charge of NaBF, of the best available purity (recrystal-
lized from 1.4 M HF solution and then vacuum dried).
The vessel was connected to a mutual supply of pure
He, BF3;, and HF gases. Precautions were taken to
remove all traces of water from the HF by bubbling
 

 

fluorine through several liters of distilled and condensed
reagent-grade HF. The saturated HF liquid was evapo-
rated to form the HF reagent gas supply used in the
preparation..

A stream of purge gas was passed through the salt.
Flow rates were adjusted at 1 atm to attain a
vapor-phase composition of 25% HF, 25% BF;, and
50% He. The unit was heated to a temperature of
425°C, approximately 20°C above the melting point of
NaBF, . Purification was continued for 30 hr, and then

135

within a silica vessel whose vapor space can be sampled
(see Fig. 12.3). An initial experiment has been con-
ducted in which coupons of chromium metal were in
contact with coolant salt with reported analyses of 120
+ 60 ppm H,0 and 310 + 50 ppm oxygen; the latter
analysis includes the oxygen in H, O. The closed capsule
and the silica vessel were outgassed at 200°C for several
days. The assembly was then heated fairly rapidly
(about 20°C/min). When the temperature reached

. 370°C, we noted a steady rise in -pressure in the

the system was allowed to cool under the static

atmosphere of gas. The unit was evacuated cold,
remelted with the system closed, and reevacuated cold
to degas the product. Recovered material was packaged
under He in a dry box before examination.

Analysis indicates that the oxygen content of the
NaBF, was reduced to a value near 20 ppm, a tenfold

increase in purity over the starting material. There is

evidence from differential thermal analysis and chem-
ical analysis that some loss of BF3 occurred, so that the
product is not a stoichiometric mixture of NaF and
- BF3 as we had hoped. It should be possible, however,
to reduce this BF; loss to any desired extent by
adjusting experimental conditions as employed in a
study of NaBF, dissociation."

The results obtained in the expenments described -

above demonstrate the objective of this procedure, to
show the feasibility of a process which has potential for

application to large-scale systems. Such procedure could

be employed continuously, if necessary, to maintain the

concentration of oxygen-containing species in fluoro- -

borate coolant salts at a very low level for the purpose
of controlling corrosion or, alternatively, to scavenge
hydrogenous species from the salt.

12.4 INVESTIGATION OF OXIDATION OF METALS
BY FLUOROBORATE COOLANT

'S. Cantor

A series of experiments is under way to determine:
(1) the oxidizing properties of the fluoroborate coolant
salt (92-8 mole % NaBF,-NaF), (2) the retention of

moisture or other hydrogen-containing species by the

coolant. If the coolant retains some moisture, then
tritium passing into the coolant from the reactor core
could be isotopically exchanged and retained in the
coolant circuit.

In an experimental run, evacuated mckel capsules

assembly. The pressure eventually reached about 8 mm
after the capsule had been heated to and maintained at
625°C for 2.5 hr, The furnace was then shut down and
the assembly slowly cooled to room temperature.

It was unfortunately not possible to analyze the
contents of the gas sampler until five days later. Gas

chromatographic analysis indicated the composition in
the sampler to be 20% by volume hydrogen, the
remaining 80% being air.

The capsule was removed and cut open. The walls of
the nickel container had not been attacked by the salt
or its vapor. The chromium coupons were mostly
covered with adherent dark-green crystals. There were
additional green crystals within the coolant salt that
had frozen close to the coupons. The green crystals
were identified by x-ray diffraction as Na3CrF¢. Micro-

136

scopic examination of crystals removed . from the

coupons also showed brown and black solids, as yet

" unidentified.

- The chromium coupons sustained a weight loss in the
experiment. From the analyses for H,(g) and for

-moisture, approximately one-fourth of the Cr weight

loss can be assigned to the reaction

- Cr+%H,0 + 2NaF + NaBF, ~

Na;CrFg + %,B,0; + %H,(g) .

At 900°K, this reaction has a AG® = —30 % 10 kcal. The
uncertainty of 10 kcal is primarily the uncertainty in

‘the free energy of formation of Na; CrF,.
. If one represents the total analyzed oxygen as O,(g),

then four-fifths of -the weight loss of Cr can be
associated with the reaction

The AGjqo for this reaction is —100 + 10 kcal. It is

1. Some of the moisture in the salt reacts with
‘chromium metal to yield hydrogen.

2. The hydrogen thus produced passes through the
nickel container in a matter of minutes.

3. One certain corrosion product is NagCrFs.

12.5 BORON TRIFLUORIDE PRESSURE OVER
FLUOROBORATE COOLANT SALT ADMIXED
WITH MSBR FUEL SALT

D. M. Richardson  J. H. Shaffer

Several experiments have been reported in which the
pressure of BF; over mixtures of NaBF,-NaF became
higher than normal due to the presence of fuel fluoride

salt.!»* Greater pressure elevations occurred when the

proportion of fuel fluoride was greater. In the MSBR
design the fluoroborate salt is maintained at a higher
pressure than the fuel salt in the primary heat ex-
changers, so that any leakage would be inward. BF; in
the fuel salt as the result of a small leak would be
removed with the normal reactor off-gas. In the event
of a large leak a provision for additional venting
capability to relieve BF; pressure might be required
during the course of shutting down for repair. For an

~early design of MSBR primary heat exchanger it was

estimated that in the extreme case that a tube suffered
total offset at both ends, the fluoroborate salt would be

injected into the fuel salt in the volume ratio of 1 to 3.

This postulated condition formed the basis for a simple
exploratory experiment to observe the release of BF,

- gas when fuel and fluoroborate fluids are mixed.

likely that only a small fraction of the analyzed oxygen

in the salt was in the form of molecular oxygen. It is

‘possible that the oxygen analysis actually provides a

more reliable H,O analysis than the routine Karl
Fischer method. The chief uncertainty in the H,O
analysis is whether or not all the moisture in the sample

has been removed by the pryldme which is subse-

quently distilled into the Karl Fischer reagent. (It is

known that not all of the salt sample dissolves in the

- pyridine.)

No firm conclusions concerning the nature of the
oxidation reactions of chromium by the coolant salt
can be reached on the basis of this first experiment. It is
anticipated that experiments currently in preparation
will provide more quantitative information, especially
of the hydrogen passing through the capsule. However

indicated, respectively, the fuel salt, fluoroborate salt,

and gas-phase temperatures. Although the temperatures .

were printed by recorder, actual readings of the
recorder pointer position were more accurate and were
used. Pointer indications were found to check within
5°F with measurements made with an ESI potenti-
ometer, model 300.

The autoclave was connected by flange to a Y-in.
stainless tubing manifold for evacuation and for pres-
sure measurement after the system was isolated. Metal-
seated 1500-psi valves with welded bellows were used.
Vacuum integrity was established, using roughing pump
and thermocouple gage, with the autoclave vessel at
1300°F and with the upper manifold under heat lamp.
Pressure measurements were made with a 200-psig Heise
gage, with uniform graduations, that was adjusted to
read 0 psia when under vacuum.

The salt additions were made under dry argon. The
fuel salt was transferred as a liquid from a batching
vessel: 1158 g of LiF-BeFThF, (72-16-12 mole %) and
UF,; to produce 0.5 mole % were charged. After
cooling, the fluoroborate was added as crushed salt:
215 g of NaBF,-NaF (92-8 mole %) was charged. The
‘estimated volume ratio of fluoroborate to fluoride at
700°C for these additions is 1 to 3. The system was
sealed again at the top and evacuated. The autoclave
was heated to 150°C and pumped for 3% hr. Little

off-gassing was observed. The system was then valved

off, remaining open only to the pressure gage. One of
the valves was connected to a % -in. tube for venting to
the stack filters, if necessary.

When the fluoroborate was first melted (385°C) a.

pressure rise of 0.3 psia was observed. When the
fluoride was first melted (513°C) the pressure was 8
psia. Subsequently, at the same temperatures, these

pressures were not reproduced and higher pressures

- were found.

Two distinctly different sets of data were obtained in
this experiment. Initially, during a period of six days,

pressure readings were made repeatedly over a range of
temperatures. Some of the points were obtained after -

equilibration for 16 to as much as 46 hr. Due to the
slow rate of thermal equilibration of the furnace-
autoclave combination, however, most of the points

were obtained at a slow heating rate of 20 to 40°F/hr.

These data are shown as circles in Fig. 12.4 in a plot of
log P against 1/T°K. With the exception of one point
the data lie on a straight line with apparent heat of
reaction of 15 kcal/mole. Temperatures of the bottom
thermocouple are plotted.

 

The point at 148.5 psia was discovered 25 min after
the last of the series of points at the upper end of the
line was taken. The heating rate had been 5 to 10°F/hr
for several hours. The temperature record just prior to
this showed that the bottom thermocouple (always the
hottest of the three, during slow changes) had dropped
12°F and that the middle thermocouple had risen 6°F
in an interval of about 4 min. These temperature

changes suggest that sudden mixing or stirring of the
two fluids had occurred. The heaters were turned off,
dampers at the top and bottom of the furnace were
opened, and the system was vented down to 100 psia. A
cloud of white smoke came from the roof stack.
Although the autoclave was cooling, the pressure rose
again to 108.7 psia in 10 min but dropped steadily
afterward.

The total volume of the isolated system was 1600 cc.
Of this, 300 cm® was outside the furnace. When the
pressure was 95 psia the bottom temperature was
647°C, and the combined salt volumes are estimated at
482 cm®, leaving 818 cm® in the furnace. Using the
ideal gas law, the amount of BF; in the gas phase was
0.15 mole at 647°C, or 8% of the total inventory (1.895

“moles BF3).

Subsequently, the autoclave was heated up and then
cooled to ambient temperature three times. In each case
an identical line was obtained with slope of 20
kcal/mole on the log P versus 1/T°K plot. These data are
shown as solid dots in the figure. When extended the

Hp — H,95 (cal/mole) are given in Table 12.1. Table
12.2 summarizes the data for the heats and entropies of
melting and transition.

KBF,4, RbBF,, and CsBF, all undergo a solid state
transition from the BaSO,-type orthorhombic structure

~ to the high-temperature cubic structure.)”® NaBF,, on

the other hand, exists as the orthorhombic (pseudo-
tetragonal) CaSQ, type of structure® at room tempera-

ture and in a noncubic form above the transition

temperature.*> This latter structure has recently been
reported® to be monoclinic with four molecules per
unit cell. However, a lowering of the symmetry at
higher temperature without a lowering of the number

_ of molecules per unit cell is quite unlikely. The

structure was derived from a powder pattern, and the
authors state that their assignment is not necessarily
correct or unique, We believe that this inconsistency

. may be avoided by showing that the x-ray spacings

line is slightly below the originally observed maximum

pressure of 148.5 psia. At the lower temperatures each
reheat yielded a different set of pressures that varied

- with the residual pressure at room temperature before

the heatup was started.

In summary, it is apparent that the originally ob-
served “discontinuity” was probably the result of
sudden spontaneous mixing of the materials in the
autoclave that had not previously been in actual
equilibrium, since no stirring or shaking was provided.
It was not possible in this experiment to determine
either that two immiscible liquid phases were always
present or that a solid phase had not appeared. The
only definite result is that the pressure of BF; over the
mixture was more than an order of magnitude greater
than that over NaBF,-NaF (92-8 mole %). The effect of
the relatively large gas volume in the experimental

system would be to reduce the mole fraction of NaBF,

and to shift the mixture. closer to the liquid-liquid
immiscibility boundary. A very thorough experimental
investigation is required to define this complex system
adequately.

12.6 HEAT CONTENT OF ALKALI
METAL FLUGROBORATES

A.S.Dworkin M. A, Bredig

We have cbmpleted our high-temperature heat con-
tent measurements of NaBF,, KBF,, RbBF,, and

CsBF,. The equations which represent our results for

(Table 12.2 and ref.5) are compatible with the assump-
tion of a mechanical mixture of the orthorhombic
low-temperature phase with a high-temperature phase
of hexagonal, rather than monoclinic, structure. These
data give a ¢/a = 1.55, which may be compared with the
}ugh-temperature form of CaSO,, also shown® to be
hexagonal rather than cubic, with a c¢/a = 1.54, that is,
slightly distorted from the ideal “close packed” sym-
metry, ¢/a = 1.63, as in wurtzite, ZnS,

Although the entropies of fusion of NaBF, and KBF,
are similar (Table 12.2), the entropy of transition of
KBF, is much larger than that of NaBF, (5.93 to 3.13
e.u.). This may be explamed qualitatively on the basis
of the differing structures of both the low- and
high-temperature solids which in turn are due to the
large difference in the size of the cations. The NaBF,
structure is more disordered below the transition, which
is reflected by the fact that at SO0°K Sy — S;9s is
more than 1 e.u. larger for NaBF,; than for KBF,. In
addition, the high-temperature cubic structure of KBF,
most probably is more compatible with anionic rota-
tional or librational disorder than is the structure of
NaBF, of lower symmetry. '

KBF,, RbBF,, and CsBF, are isodimorphous and
therefore can be considered as a series separate from
NaBF,. Table 12.2 shows that although the enthalpies
and temperatures of melting are similar, there is a
decrease in temperature, entropy, and enthalpy of
transition of 21, 25, and 41%, respectively, with
increasing cation size in this series. The particularly

' latge relative change in the enthalpy may be attributed

to the decrease in lattice energy with increasing size of
the cation, which also facilitates the rotation or
libration of the fluoroborate ion. The large decrease in
enthalpy as compared with the entropy of transition
also explains the relatively low temperature of transi-
tion found for CsBF,.

13. Physical Chemistry of Molten Salts

13.1 EQUILIBRATION OF RARE-EARTH-
CONTAINING MOLTEN FLUORIDES
| WITH VARIOUS SOLIDS

C.E.Bamberger  C.F. Baes, Jr.

We have continued our attempts® to prepare insoluble
compounds of rare earths for possible use as rare-earth
ion exchangers by reactions in molten LiF-BeF,-ThF,
(72-16-12 mole %). The new tests have included
phosphates and various insoluble oxides as possible
reactants. In addition to CeF;, used previously with
144Ce as a tracer, YF; was used in current tests
because it chemically resembles the rare earths in the
middle of the series and can be determined spectro-
graphically with good sensitivity. As previously, tested
reactants were stirred with the molten salt containing
the dissolved rare earth. From time to time samples
were taken to determine if rare earth had been removed
from the salt and whether new solid phases might have
formed. , o '

A number of the reactions which are most likely to
occur if the compounds currently being tested are
effective extractants for rare-earth cations are listed in
Table 13.1. In previous tests, reaction 1 was found not

to occur with CeF; in the -presence of excess NiO,

added to suppress the direct oxidation of the nickel .

container by V,O;. Because of concern that NiO might
instead have reacted with V, 05 to form Ni(VO;),,an
additional test was run with V,0Og in the absence of
NiO. As Table 13.2 shows, there was no evidence of

cerium or yttrium removal. As previously, considerable
~ corrosion of the nickel container was noted.

Reactions 2 to 6, which similarly suggest the forma-
tion of oxide phases containing rare earths by reaction
of sparingly soluble oxides, similarly were found not to
occur (Table 13.2).

Since one of the most abundant rare-earth minerals is
monazite (thorium-—rare-earth phosphates), we at-
tempted the synthesis of such. compounds from the
melt by the addition of sodium phosphate (reaction 7).
Neither a significant reduction in the !44Ce concentra-
tion nor any other evidence of appreciable reaction
between the phosphate and the molten fluorides was
detected. Calcium fluoride was added to the system in
an attempt to. precipitate a rare-earth-containing cal-

cium phosphate (reaction 8). This seemed a possibility

since a systematic study of rare-earth minerals by
Mineyev? includes examples of the replacement of Ca®*
by Ln* plus OH™ or F~ jons. The results obtained

revealed an appreciable extraction of rare earths.

Analysis of the salt phase also suggested the presence of
Ca** and PO, % in solids, but these were not further
identified (Table 13.2).

Reaction 9 was suggested by the phase diagram of the

CaF,-YF; system, wherein a solid solution containing
as much as 55 mole % YF; as well as the compound
CaF,-4YF; is reported.® The solubility of calcium at
600°C in the presence and absence of PO, (8.8 and
7.8 mole %, respectively) and the percentage of cerium
remaining in the melt (78 and 76) may be interpreted
to mean that the solid phases present in both experi-
ments were solid solutions of CaF,-YF; with some

CeF3. Under experimental conditions studied, the |

distribution of cerium seems insufficiently favorable
and the solubility of the calcium-containing solids too
high to render reactions 8§ and 9 a promising basis for a
separation method for rare earths. |

While these tests have all given essentially negative
results, they have produced some useful information.
As expected, TiO, and Nb,Os, currently being studied
for the first time, along with Cr, O; and Fe; 0, , studied
previously, react only to a small extent with the molten
fluoride. It appears that the orthophosphate ion is
stable in such systems and does not act as an oxidant
toward nickel containers. Finally, the solubility of
CaF, in the salt used (72-16-12 mole % LiF-BeF,-
ThF,) is evidently 10 mole % at 600°C. '

132 THE OXIDE CHEMISTRY OF PLUTONIUM
IN MOLTEN FLUORIDES

C.E.Bamberger R.G.Ross C.F.Baes,Jr.

Since plutonium ‘is being considered as a fuel for
moltensalt reactors,! it is important to examine its
chemistry in molten fluoride systems containing oxide.
Such information is needed to establish in a reactor fuel
salt the conditions of redox potential and oxide
concentration under which plutonium would remain in

solution as PuF; . It might also be of value in developing

reprocessing methods for such fuel salts.

From the available data®™® it is possible to construct
the Pourbaix diagram shown in Fig. 13.1, which
summarizes the predicted behavior of plutonium in
molten Li, BeF,; as a function of the oxidation poten-
tial (the ordinate) and the oxide ion concentration (the
abscissa). In addition to the three oxides of plutonium
(PuO, 5, Pu0, 4, and Pu0O;) whose stabilities have

been determined,® it is possible that PuOF may be

142

formed in the present system,* but there is insufficient

evidence to judge its stability. The boundaries of the

region of dissolved PuF; in this diagram are calculated
for two concentrations; one is the hypothetical unit

‘mole fraction and the other is 0.002 mole fraction,

which is approximately the concentration of PuF,
which would be used in a molten=salt reactor fuel.
These boundaries are uncertain by as much as plus or
minus one log unit along each axis from the uncertamty
given for the free energy of formation of PuF;.* Within

‘such a wide uncertainty one cannot rule out the

possibility that plutonium might precipitate as PuQ; s
from a molten-salt reactor fuel which becomes contami-
nated with sufficient oxide. At lower oxide concentra-
tions, but under relatively oxidizing conditions, PuO,
clearly could be precipitated. With the ThF,4 present in

an MSBR fuel, the formation of a PuO,-ThO, solid .
‘solution becomes possible, and this should lower the

oxide level or the oxidation potential at which a
plutonium oxide-containing phase might precipitate.

Because of the uncertainties in the behavior repre- -

sented by Fig. 13.1 we were prompted to attempt a
direct measurement of one of the equilibria which
establish the boundaries of the dissolved PuF; region in
a diagram such as this. The result would not only
improve the accuracy of such a diagram for plutonium;
it should also yield an improved value of the formation
free energy of PuF;.

To various molten fluoride mixtures containing PuF;,

stepwise additions were made of an oxide (BeO, ZrO,,

or ThO,) known to be the normally stable saturating
oxide phase. The equilibrations were performed in a
specially designed leak-tight stirred vessel, described
elsewhere,® which had been assembled inside a glove
box suited for work with alpha emitters. Filtered
samples of the fluoride phase and unfiltered samples of

both oxide and fluoride phases were taken for analysis. _

analytical uncertainties occurred in the composition of
the equilibrated (Pu-Th)O, phase at 590°C, and these
are reflected in the corresponding uncertainties of
XpuF, and Q. The temperature has a marked effect on
the value of the equilibrium quotient; between 590°C
and 690°C, Q changes by a factor of 10.

The resulting values of Q for reaction (1) were used to
estimate the free energy of formation of PuF; in the

in this solvent is given by '

plutonium compounds.®  The values of Oetting are
those calculated by Buyers and Murbach?® in 1957 from
measurements of the equilibrium

Buyers and Murbach used the free energies of formation
per fluoride of both UF, and UF; available at that date

(88 and 89 keal at 1573°K, respectively) and concluded
that an accurate determination of n was not necessary
since it did not affect significantly the calculation of

AGPuF However, using more recent estimates of the
correspondmg free energies of formation of UF, and
UF, (86.5 and 93.0 at 1573°K),® it is apparent that
UF; was the most stable fluoride present under the
-experimental conditions of Buyers and Murbach. This
information together with their experimental data
yields values of AGp, g, which are consistent with the
present estimates.

A revised Pourbaix diagram which incorporates these
new formation free energies of PuF; and PuF, is shown
in Fig. 13.2. The considerably more negative values of
these free energies cause the boundaries between the
dissolved fluorides and the solid oxides of plutonium to
shift about three decades to the right, toward higher
dissolved oxide concentrations. This result makes it
abundantly clear why PuQ, s could not be precipitated
from Li, BeF, saturated with BeO. Figure 13.3 shows
the predicted behavior in the LiF-BeF,-ThF, (72-16-12
mole %) melt, with various compositions shown for the
Pu0,-ThO, solid solution. It is apparent that under the
mildly reducing conditions (Xy g, /Xy, ~ 100) of an
MSBR fuel, even if an oxide phase were inadvertently
precipitated it would contain no significant amount of

PuO,.

13.3 THE CeF;-ThF, SYSTEM
L.O.Gilpatrick H.Insley C.J, Barton

Exploration of the CeF;-ThF; system was under-
taken as part of the longrange investigation of the
LiF-BeF,-ThF, -CeF3 system. It should, however, have
considerable scientific interest because, except for thLe
system UF;-UF,,! little is known about the binary

-systems of the heavy-metal tri- and tetrafluorides.

Our studies have been limited to gradient quenches
because the high liquidus and solidus temperatures for
the system exceed the capability of our present
differential thermal analysis equipment. The end mem-
bers were purified by fusion with ammonium bifluoride
to remove oxides, and weighed quantities of the

Rather limited data have been obtained because of

‘difficulty experienced with self-welding between the

nickel quench tubes and the nickel block that surrounds

the tubes. The data obtained to date show that ThF, is

the primary phase in mixtures containing more than 81
mole % ThF,. There appears to be a eutectic composi-
tion formed between ThF, and a new phase, pre-
sumably a compound that is as yet unidentified,

meltmg at 975°C. Another unidentified phase appears
as the first crystals to separate from melts containing 67

and 70 mole % ThF,. There is also evidence of solid -

solution of ThF, in CeF;, but the extent of solid
solution formation remains to be determined.

We have modified our high-temperature quench fur-
nace by introducing a thin graphite liner into the nickel
quench block in an effort to overcome the self-welding
problem. If this is successful, study of this system

- should be completed in the near future.

that the maximum solubility of CeF3 and PuF; in an

mately 0.5 mole % at 550°C is therefore confirmed.

"The present findings are also consistent with the results

Because of the low solubility of CeF; in the ternaryr

crystal transition at a temperature of 841°C. Their
observations were made by thermal analysis while
Since poly-
morphic crystal transitions have not been previously
reported in this widely studied compound this report
aroused some interest. Attempts were made to confirm
this observation using differential thermal analysis
apparatus which we developed recently for molten-salt
studies.3

A sample of depleted UF, prepared at the Oak Ridge
Gaseous Diffusion Plant and designated SR-1909, batch
4, was examined first, in the temperature range 700 to
1010°C with a differential temperature sensitivity of 50
pvfem (~1.25°C/cm) and at a rate of 1°/min. A
laboratory-purified lot of UF, used as a spectrographic
standard was also examined under identical conditions.

No evidence of a thermal phenomenon could be
found at or near 841°C on repeated thermal cycling.
However, a single endothermic peak was found at

'958°C on heating the Sr-1909 batch 4 material during

358°C. The composition of this ternary invariant point
is yet to be determined accurately, but it lies near the
composition LiF-BeF, -CeF; (46.5-53-0.5 mole %).
Some evidence has been found for two immiscible
liquids in equilibrium in a small region of this system
which is rich in BeF; and near the CeF; -BeF, eutectic

Melting temperatures for the two materials were
1010°C and 1020°C respectively (literature value
1036 C4 %), and meltmg occurred over a wide tempera-
ture range, indicating lack of purity.

Khripin and co-workers noted that the oxygen con-
tent in their system was between 1 and 3 wt %. The two
specimens of UF, we have examined contained 0.18
and 0.078 wt % oxygen, respectively representing 1.7
and 0.7 mole % UQO, .

‘The present evidence seems to mdlcate that no
polymorphlc crystal transition exists in pure UF,4 at or
near 841°C, at least within the sensitivity limits of the .

most probably due to oxygen species undergoing |

13.6 ESTIMATION OF ACTIVITY COEFFICIENTS
IN LiF-BeF, -ThF, MELTS

C.F. Baes, Jr.

Shaffer et al.! have collected a considerable amount
of data on the following reductive extraction equilibria
over a wide range of composmons in L1F-BeF, -ThF,
mixtures: :

LiF(F) + % Th°(Bi) = % ThF, (F) + Li® (Bi)
CeF3 (F) + % ThO(Bi) = % ThF, (F) + Ce® (Bi)

(wherein F and Bi denote, respectively, the molten
fluoride and the bismuth phase). Making the reasonable
assumption that activity coefficients in the dilute
bismuth phase are unity, the equilibrium constants for
these reactions may be written

fCeF3

 

(wherein DM is the observed ratio of mole fraction of

M° in the bismuth phase to MF, in the fluoride phase
and fMF is the activity coefﬁclent in the fluoride
phase). Barton ef al.? have measured the solubility of
CeF; also as a function of composition in
LiF-BeF,-ThF, melts. These results give directly the
variation of f .. : st

K XCeF3fCeF3 - ()

This, combined with the observed values of DCe/DTh ,

should yield the variation with composition of FrnFy»
and this in turn, combined with Dy ;/D3{*, should give
the variation of f; ;r. In short, these data can yield the
activity coefficients of all the components over the
composition range involved -if a smtable means can be
found to correlate them. :

Such a correlation of activity coefﬁcnents 1is being
attempted in LiF-BeF, -MF -NF, mixtures by an
extension of a polymer model prevmusly apphed with
some . success to binary LiF-BeF, mixtures.® As

149,

previously, it is.assumed that Be?* is coordinated by
four fluoride ions to form BeF, 2" tetrahedra and that
by the sharing of corners and edges of such tetrahedra
(ie., by the formation of single and double fluoride
bridges between Be?* ions) all the possible polymeric
species Be,Fj(®—22)~ are formed in the fluoride
mixtures. The relative stability of each of the numerous
such species is defined by the equilibrium

aBeF4%" = Be F), (0-20)-+ (42 — b)F-
and the corfésponding equilibrium cohstant

=exp [4a - b)x,], (4)

wherem the parentheses denote actmtles and «, is an
adjustable parameter.?

It is assumed that the third and the fourth component
(MF and NFz) form one or several successive mono-
nuclear species, for example, in the case of MF,,

MFc(c-y)- , MF,, (c*1-)- .

The relative stability of each complex MF,, is expressed
in terms of a stepwise equilibrium constant

Here the nth stepwise constant is evaluated in terms of
a free energy parameter a3 analogous to o, for the
Be,F}, species. The adjustable parameter 73 is included
to provide for the expected decrease in the magnitude
of successive stepwise constants as the number of
bound fluoride ions increases. The overall stability

A similar expression may be written for the formation

the adjustable parameters oz and 7, . :

- As previously, the entropy of mixing of all the species

is expressed in terms of the volume fractions (¢;) of

each species: :

¢>, is approximated as the fraction of the total fluoride '

in'the system which is present in species i. The heat of
mlxmg is of the form

where the summation is over all the pairwise interac-
tions of the four different kinds of species (1) F~, (2)
Be F,(b—-2a)- (3) MF,(?=¥)-, (4) NF,(®~2)~, The
coefficients t; and t; are the numbers of nonbridging
fluorides on each kind of species: :

ty =1, t,=2b—4a, t3=bs, t4=b, .

The product #;n;(#; ¢;/b;) is intended to be proportional
to the number of contacts between nonbridging

fluorides of species i and j. The six coefficients §;,,

Bi13,B14,B23, P24, Baa, reflect the heat effect of such
contacts. - A

Proceeding as previously, the activity of each species
is obtained by the partial differentiation

(AH,, [RT -

Substitution of the resulting expressions for each

activity into Eqgs. (4) and (6) yields expressions for the -

fluoride, the monomer BeF,?",

ality constants will be chosen-so that the activities of
LiF and BeF, are unity in 2LiF-BeF, and so that the
activity coefficients of MF,, and NF, approach unity as
Xy p. and Xy F, approach zero in this solvent.

In applying this model to the reductive extraction and

solubility results!»2 in LiF-BeF,-ThF,-CeF; melts, it

was found that the data could not be accounted for by
the assumption of only one thorium and one cerium
species in solution. An acceptable fit was obtained,
however, by assuming the followmg scheme of species
(Table 13.4):

ThF, , ThFs~, ThF¢ %~
CCF2+ ’ CCF3 s CCF4_

Here it was necessary to adjust only the o3, 04 ,and B34
parameters of the model; a, and §,, were known
already from the fit of the model to the binary
LiF-BeF, mixture. The other § parameters were set
somewhat arbitrarily at the values given in Table 13.4.
Thus the first fit was obtained by using three adjustable
parameters of the model, along with the three ad-

~ justable equilibrium constant values. The standard error

of fit was 1.32 times the estimated random error of the
data. No significant improvement was obtained by
assuming 7y; = ¥4 and adjusting this additional param-
eter. A slightly improved fit (0 = 1.24) was obtained

with the scheme

ThF* , ThF,*, ..., ThF,*
CeF*',CeF,*,. .., CeFgs3"

and an adjustable y (= y3 = v4) parameter. This scheme
is essentially the same as the previous one, since the
principal species over the composition range involved
are the same, but it is preferred as being less arbitrary.

The small number of parameters of the model which
require adjustment in order to fit the data suggests that
the model is a reasonable representation of the nature
of molten LiF-BeF,-ThF; mixtures and should provide

Since the CeF; curves depend on the relatively more
accurate solubility measurements,? they should be the
most accurate, with an estimated uncertainty not
exceeding 10% at compositions farthest from the
reference composition. The LiF curves depend partly,

and the ThF4 curves depend almost entirely, on the less
accurate reductive extraction measurement! and have
uncertainties which may reach 30% at the extremes of
the composition range. The BeF; curves and LiF curves
depend in part on accurate emf data for the binary
system3:4 and should generally be of intermediate
accuracy. As more data become available from current
emf and other studies, it should be possible with the aid

-of this model to generate activity coefficient curves for

other solutes in these LiF-BeF,-ThF,; melts. This
should greatly enhance our ability to predict the effect
of melt composition on many important equ1hbr1a in
MSBR fluoride melts.

J. Braunstein

A promising modification of the reductive extraction

process for removal of rare-earth fission products from.

molten-salt breeder reactor fuels employs an acceptor
salt such as molten lithium chloride contacting the
bismuth phase.! Thermodynamic data suggest that the
fission product alkali metals, Rb and Cs, probably will
concentrate in the chloride phase.? Ba and Sr should
have a smal]er tendency to transfer to the chloride, but
in trying to calculate distribution ratios of Cs, Rb, Ba,
and Sr in the process, activity coefficients are needed
for the fluoride salts, chloride salts, and the metals in
the bismuth phase, Direct experimental measurements
of the needed thermodynamic quantities are not yet

153

available. However, recent advances in molten-salt

solution theory have been made®
useful guide to the estimation of activity coefficients
from data in related systems. Estimates are given in
Table 13.5 of the activity coefficient; vy, of SrCl, and
BaCl, as dilute solutions in molten LiCl, of StF, and
BaF, as dilute solutions in LiF, and of Sr and Ba as

gradual attack of the silica by the fluoride melts, with
the production of gaseous SiF, and dissolved oxide, has
caused difficulties, In the current measurements, we
have investigated the use of sintered BeO as a container
material for the reference electrode.

The compartments used, obtained from Brush Beryl-
lium Corporation, were 99.8% BeO. They had been
closed at the lower end by a disk of the same sintered
BeO. In initial tests it was found, fortunately, that the
seal between the disk and the end of each tube was not

“complete, but in fact contained holes or cracksas large

as 2 p. The electrical resistance measured with molten
salt both inside and outside these compartments was
quite low, typically 75 ohms, Yet salt leakage through
these compartments appeared to be very small. These
compartments have been exposed to Li, BeF; melts for
periods up to three weeks with no detectable weight
loss or visible signs of attack.

Cell 1. — Since the BeO compartments seemed
practically impervious to salt we were concerned with

~ the possibility of BeO acting as a solid electrolyte. If we

assume that the Be?* ion or the 0% is carrying the
current, the cell reaction for cell I above would be

Be’(()+ NiO()>BeO@+No(@) (1)

and for either case the cell potential would be in-
dependent of melt composition. However, if there is
liquid contact and we assume that all the current is

_carried across the liquid junction by the Li* ion' we
‘may then write the following cell reaction:

Be®(c) + NiO(c) + BeF,(d, R) + 2LiF(d) > Ni°(c)

+ BeO(c) + BeF,(d) + 2LiF(4, R); (2)

R designates solutes in the reference compartment,
Since the reference solution closely approximated the
composition of the compound Li, BeF,, the standard
state we have adopted for LiF(d) and BeF,(d), then
8Lir(r) 2nd 2p.p, () are unity, and the cell potential
is given by :

S RT dBeF, . | ’

To check the effect, or lack of effect, of melt

composition on the cell potential we varied the com-
position of the LiF-BeF, imixture on the left in cell 1.
Results are shown in Fig, 13,5, where they are plotted
against activity data from previous measurements.? As
can be seen, the cell potential does vary with melt
composition, showing a dependence on @y, /a F
which agrees quite well with Eq. (3), represented by the

line in Fig. 13.5. This result suggests strongly that the -

current is being carried from one haif-cell to the other
by Li* ion through the molten salt, rather than by
mobile Be?* or O*” jons in the solid BeO.,

A series of measurements of cell I containing Li, BeF,
was made over the temperature range 500 to 700°C.
The results differ by about 5 mv from those obtained
previously with the use of silica compartments The
present results give

'E‘;=l.892-—0.044(Tl1000),_ @

where T is the temperature in degrees Kelvin. This

“expression for the potential of cell I, when combined

with our previous measurements of the Be?*/Be® couple
vs the HF/H,, F~ electrode,? gives the expression in
Table 13.6 for the potential of the NiO, Be?*/BeQ, Ni®
reference electrode vs the HF/H, , F~ electrode.

The above measurements were made over a period of

was no tendency of the cell potential to run down, nor

was being “poisoned” by the reduction of reducible

metals on the electrode surface. This is strong evidence

that there was no significant leakage of Nl ion from
the reference electrode compartment.

13.9 ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITIES
AND IONIC MOBILITIES IN THE
'MOLTEN LiF-BeF, SYSTEM

G. D. Robbins  J. Braunstein

In addition to its relevance to the molten-salt reactor
program, investigation of electrical transport in molten
LiF-BeF, mixtures is of considerable theoretical inter-
‘est, The binary LiF-BeF, system is comprised of pure
components exhibiting transport properties which dif-
fer by over seven orders of magnitude. Both in its
transport properties and its thermodynamic properties
it exhibits characteristics of network liquids at the
BeF, end and of a typical ionic liquid at the LiF end.'™

The results of electrical conductivity measurements in
LiF-BeF, mixtures ranging in composition from 34 to
70 mole % beryllium fluoride presented here contain
data from two previous experiments?-5 and afford an
analysis of the variation of electrical conductivity with

~ both composition and temperature. Ionic mobilities

have been reported - previously® at two temperatures
and two compositions using transference number® and
density” data. The new conductivity data reported here
permit an extended evaluation of the composxtlon
dependence of internal ionic mobilities.

Cell constants of the four cells employed in these
studies ranged from 98.55 to 150.4 cm ™! as determined
by previously described techniques.4-8 Conductances in
the molten fluorides were measured with a specially
constructed ac bridge which contains a variable resist-
ance and capacitance, in series, in the balancing arm and
has the capability of variation of voltage and frequency
of the applied sinusoidal potential.® Applied potentials
were 25 to 50 mv peak-to-peak across the cell. For

- resistances of the order of 100 ohms the bridge

inaccuracy is <*0.1% over the frequency range 0.1 to
30 kHz and increases toward %0.2% as resistances
approach 10 or 500 ohms. |

- As has been previously discussed,®:? the frequency
range over which resistance is independent of frequency
(or varies in a regular mauner) must be determined for
each experimental arrangement and electrolyte solu-
tion, This was again  demonstrated in the current
investigation, in which a frequency range could be
found over which the molten KNO; used in cell
constant determination exhibited no variation of resist-
ance with frequency, within the $0.2% uncertainty
limits of the bridge, for each of the four cells (the
ranges were 1 to 20, 1 to 10, 0.5 to 3, and 3 to 30
kHz), With molten fluorides in the cells, two of the
mixtures showed a frequency-independent region (3 to

-30 kHz and 5 to 50 kHz), while in the other two,

resistances were approximately linear in 1A/F (2%
variation, 0.5 to 5 kHz, in one; 0.5% variation, 1 to 10
kHz, in the other). In these melts measured resistances
‘were extrapolated to infinite frequency vs 1 l\/ﬁ_

Specific conductances are listed in Table 13.7, These
were obtained from four sets of experiments in dif-
ferent cells (see Fig. 13.7). The upper temperature limit
of approximately 550°C was imposed by use of molten
potassium nitrate as a molten salt bath. In one
experiment (cell 2) no bath was present, permitting an
~ upper temperature limit of 647°C to be attained.
However, as the data obtained with cell 2 reflect (Fig.
13.7), the absence of a bath around the cell resulted in
greater scatter, probably due to temperature variation
in the conducting region of the cell. '

157

As can be seen from Fig. 13.7, the specific con-
ductance data vary smoothly as a function of tempera-
ture. The curves shown represent computer-fitted least-
squares equations that were used to generate the
isotherms of specific conductance plotted in Fig. 13.8
as a function of composition. The points shown are
calculated values (at 25°C intervals) for each experi-
mental composition and extend to the next 25°C be-
yond the actual data range. It is believed that the di-
vergence of the data at X = 0.540 from a smooth curve

_ at higher temperatures is due to experimental scatter.
That the data obtained at X = 0.500 with cell 4 form a
smooth curve with data from cell 1 at compositions on
either side, lends added credence to the results,

Rather than reporting the 49 parameter values re-
quired for interpolation employing the individual equa-
tions shown in Figs. 13.7 and 13.8, it is more
convenient to represent the specific conductance as a

13.10 ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITIES OF
PROPOSED MSER FUEL COMPOSITIONS
"IN THE LiF-BeF,-ThF, SYSTEM

G.D. Robbins - A. S. Gallanter"

The absence of reliable theories for predicting electri-
cal transport in molten salts renders a priori estimation
of electi'icaI conductance in ternary mixtures extremely
uncertain® Hence, specific conductances and their
temperature dependences from near the liquidus to
650°C have been measured for four proposed MSBR
fuel compositions. Two additional LiF-BeF,-ThF,
compositions having equal molar ratios to individual
proposed fuel compositions were also investigated to
determine the effect of additions of each component.

Starting materials®> were of compositions (in mole
percent LiF-BeF,-ThF,) 68-20-12, 63-25-12, and
72-21-7. These had been previously treated with an
H,/HF mixture followed by reduction with pure
hydrogen. A liquid aliquot of each starting material was
delivered into a nickel vessel under argon, frozen, and
opened in a dry box; the entire sample was ground to
30 mesh particle size and mixed on a rotating tumbler
for at least 3 hr to ensure homogeneity. Two additional
compositions (60.5-28-11.5 and 71-18.13-10.87) were
obtained by addition of either clear pieces of lithium
fluoride, which had been fused under a hydrogen-argon
mixture and slowly crystallized, or sublimed beryllium
fluoride glass.* A sixth composition (73-16-11) was
prepared from the component starting materials, the
ThF, having been treated with H, /HF followed by H,.

The silica conductance cells and measuring bridge are
described elsewhere.® Cell constants ranged in value
from 93.09 to 156.12 cm™' and were independent of
frequency (£0.1%) from 10 to 50 kHz as determined in
molten potassium nitrate.’ With molten fluorides in the

- cells, some showed no. frequency dependence of the

resistance, while the resistances of others varied as 1 I\/_
and were extrapolated to infinite frequency. Assigned
uncertainties in the determination of specific con-
ductance are 0.4% from cell constant determination,

0.2% from resistance measurement, 0.3% from tempera-
ture measurement, 0.5% from 1/+/f extrapolation, and
1.5% from temperature gradients resulting from the
absence of a molten nitrate bath due to the high
temperatures. Assuming randomness and independence
of errors, the calculated probable error is 1.7%. Con-

sidering additivity of the assigned uncertainties, the

estimated overall uncertainty is of the order of +3%.

Specific conductance data for six LiF-BeF,-ThF,
mixtures are given in Table 13.9. The temperature
variation of specific conductance is well represented by
linear equations, as can be seen from Fig. 13.11. The
computer-fitted least-squares equations represented in
Fig. 13.11 and the standard error of fit, o, for each
composition are listed in Table 13.10,

Three pairs of curves have a constant ratio of two of
the components. The effect of variation of the molar

concentration of the third component is shown in Table

13.11. At the compositions noted, addition of LiF at
constant molar ratio of BeF, to ThF, results in an
increase in the specific conductance. Addition of either
BeF, or ThF, at constant molar ratio of the remaining

two components lowers the specific conductance. These -

measurements supersede estimates of conductance for
four proposed MSBR fuel compositions.®

13.11 DETERMINATION OF LIQUIDUS
 TEMPERATURES IN THE LiF-BeF,
SYSTEM FROM EMF MEASUREMENTS
OF TRANSFERENCE CELLS

K.A.Romberger J. Braunstein-

Emf measurements of cells with transference provide

a method by which, in favorable cases, precise deter-

minations can be made of liquidus or solid saturation

temperatures in multicomponent systems. The tech-

nique, to be useful, requires that the emf be stable,

- reproducible, and responsive to the change of activity in
the melt accompanying a phase change occurring in one

of the half-cells. The phase change may be engendered

~ either by changmg the temperature at constant total

composition or by changing the composition at con-
stant temperature. In either case, plots of emf vs
composition or emf vs temperature show discontinuities
of slope at the liquidus composition or temperature.
Our studies of the emf’s of the cell with transference?

indicated that the system I.iF;Ber ‘was particularly
amenable to precise phase boundary determinations
with the cell (1). Measurements were made in which the

‘reference solution (I) remained homogeneous while the

melt in the bulk compartment (II) was transformed
from a homogeneous solution to one containing the
equilibrium saturating solid, either by additions of one
component isothermally, or by lowering the temper-
ature of the entire cell. The measurements have yielded
liquidus temperatures in the LiF-BeF, system for
compositions between 0.12 and 0.58 mole fraction
BeF,. Experimental detalls of the emf measurements
are given in ref. 1.

Liquidus temperatures and composmons were derived
from plots of emf vs the composition of compartment
II at constant temperature, as in Fig. 13.124, and from
plots of emf vs temperature at a fixed overall compo-
sition of compartment II, as in Fig. 13.12b. These plots
are representative of the sensitivity of the method,
namely, about 0.0002 to 0.0003 mole fractlon BeF, in
composition and +0.2°C in temperature. = .

‘The' liquidus-temperature—composition results are
shown in Table 13.12. These data were obtained from
two independent experiments, which overlap along the
LiF liquidus for approximately a 50°C temperature
interval. The internal consistency of each set of points
is within $0.0002 mole fraction BeF;, but there
appears to be an offset of approximately 0.0015 mole
fraction BeF, between the two sets. This probably

“results in part from an uncertainty of +0.001 mole

fraction BeF, in the correction of the composition, in

one of the experiments, for material withdrawn from

the bulk compartment into the small reference com- .
partment. - S

An interesting aspect of the LiF-BeF, system has
been whether the solid compound Li,BeF,; melts
congruently, as do the other alkali flucroberyllates, or
incongruently. Three different solid phases have been
shown to exist in equilibrium with the liquid phase of
LiF-BeF, : LiF, Li, BeF,, and BeF,. If, when the total
bulk composition is 0.3333 mole fraction BeF,, the
solid in equilibrium with the liquid is Li, BeF,, then the
compound . melts congruently, and, in addition, an

' LiF-Li, BeF, eutectic exists (although it might coincide
- with the melting point). If the equilibrium solid at

0.3333 mole fraction BeF, is LiF, then melting of
Li, BeF, is incongruent, and there is a peritectic. The
latest résumé of this system by Thoma et al? inter-
preted the available data to suggest that Li,BeF,
melted incongruently. We believe the precision and
accuracy of the emf method, however, to be capable of
resolving the question virtually unequivocally, and the
new results indicate that Li, BeF, melts congruently.

“The evidence for this conclusion is presented below.

When the emf is measured of a cell in which a.
homogeneous solution is cooled. until precipitation
occurs, the observed emf indicates the composition of
the solution phase regardless of whether solid is present
or not. The direction of the emf change after the onset
of precipitation is determined by whether the com-
position of BeF, in the melt increases or decreases.

Comparing a series of mixtures whose initial com-
positions cross the composition of the compound, as

indicated schematically in Fig. 13.13, the cell emf -

increases during precipitation for initial compositions

on one side of the compound composition, and

decreases on the other side. For an incongruently
melting compound the emf’s will always change in the
same direction. Thus a compound, peritectic, or eutec-

tic point can be identified. It should be noted that this -

argument depends only on the response of the Be

electrodes to BeF, concentrations and therefore yields -

the topology of the liquidus line independent of

possible errors in values of temperature or composition.

For compositions within +0.005 mole fraction of the
Li; BeF4 composition, the liquidus curve was found to
be very flat; that is, the melting temperature was quite

insensitive to composition change. Hence a large frac-

tion of the total salt present had to precipitate or
dissolve to lower or raise the temperature an experi-

mentally meaningful amount, say 0.1°C. Because of this
heat load, it was not feasible to increment the equilib-
rium temperature when a large fraction of solid was
present, : '

Hence, rather than trying to maintain temperature
equilibrium, we cooled the solution slowly at a nearly
constant rate, The emf was recorded as a function of
time both before and after precipitation occurred.

‘Figure 13.14 shows a plot of emf vs time where all the

initial emf’s have been. shifted to a common zero value

- in order to emphasize the changes. The fingered pattern

shows that the solution composition moved first toward
higher and then toward lower BeF, compositions as the

- initial overall BeF, concentration was lowered. LiF

additions 96 and 97 showed very little emf change

~ while precipitation was occurting. The calculated com-

positions of these solutions were 0.3337 and 0.3329
mole fraction BeF,, compared with the theoretical

- value of 0.33333 for Li; BeF,4. X-ray data show that

13.12 COORDINATION EFFECTS ON
U(IV) SPECTRA IN FLUORIDE MELTS

L. M Toth

The spectrum of U(IV) in molten fluorides has been
previously reported! and is currently being used for
spectroscopic determinations of U(IV) concentrations.
This  present investigation is aimed at correlating
changes in the stability of U(III)-U(IV) mixtures to
changes in the number of fluoride ions associated with
the uranium cations. A variation in the number and
positioning of fluoride ions around a cation is expected
to alter its visible and ultraviolet spectrum; but until
- now, little attention has been paid to these effects in
molten fluorides. It is of interest to view this aspect of
coordination chemistry in detail because the nature of
the fluoride ion environment should affect not only the

spectrum but also the reactivity of the coordinated
metal ion. These coordination effects are expected to

play a more significant role in polyvalent systems than
in monovalent ones. Dilute fluoride solutions of
U(II)-U(IV) provide the most pertinent systems for
initial study to properly assess both the measurability

of coordination effects and their influence on stabiliza- -

165

tion of valence states. Information gained from this
system will serve as a guide when less familiar poly-
valent systems are undertaken in detail (e.g., Nb and
Mo).

The spectra- of U(dV) in Figs. 13.16 and 13.17
demonstrate the influence of solvent composition and
temperature changes respectively. The concentration of
UQV) in all solutions is approximately 1 mole %.
Curves 4, B, and C of Fig. 13.16 show U(IV) at 550°C
in Flinak (LiF-NaFKF, 46.5-11.5-42.0 mole %), LiF-
BeF, (66-34 mole %), and LiF-BeF, (48-52 mole %)
respectively. Curves 4 through D of Fig. 13.17 show
U(V) in LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %) at 460, 500, 550,
and 690°C respectively, One species of interest is found
at high free-fluoride concentrations and low tempera-
tures (curve A, both figures). Preliminary results from
crystal spectra of U(IV) in known environments lead to
the assignment of this species as 8-coordinated U(IV). It

is characterized by intense, well-resolved peaks at 9200, _
15,400, and 20,500 cm™', Lesser peaks belonging to
this species are also found at 6200 and 7200 cm™ and
are perhaps more useful in identifying 8-coordinated
U(IV) because other species of U(IV) do not absorb
here appreciably.

- As either the free fluoride ion concentration is
decreased or the temperature is increased, there is a
shift to a second species (trend of curves A-C, Fig.
13.16, and curves A—D, Fig. 13.17) which is character-
ized by less-intense, broader bands at 9200 and 15,800
em™! and no bands at 6200 and 7200. It is believed
that this species is of lower coordination number,
presumably in equilibrium with the 8-coordinated
species:

UFg* < UF 4—x+(s —%)F".

Although the UF, 4~ species has not yet been identi-
- fied, it is presumed to be 7-coordinated U(IV). By
comparison with 9-coordinated U(IV) crystal spectra,
there is no evidence to suggest that 9-coordinated U(IV)
exists in any molten fluoride solutions thus far studied.
The most striking effect of decreasing coordination
number in U(IV) fluoride spectra is a decrease in the
intensity of the 9200<m™" peak (cf. Fig. 13.16, curve
A,e=21.52 curve C, e = 15 liters mole ™! cm l)
It is at present premature to discuss the effect of
-altering the distribution of fluoride ions around U(IV)

13.13 HYDROGEN BEHAVIOR IN MOLTEN-SALT
REACTOR SYSTEMS

| R. A. Strehlow

The transport processes and chemical behavior of
| hydrogen isotopes are interrelated parameters in mol-
ten-salt reactor design considerations. The transport of
hydrogen is determined by solubility and diffusivity in
moderator, salt, and metal. The chemical behavior is a
function of the oxidation-reduction potential in the
salt, the radiation field, and possible reactivity with the
graphite moderator. This section summarizes the results
of a literature survey pertaining to some of these
factors.

At low pressures of H, and low concentrations of UF;
a large fraction of the hydrogen should therefore be
present as HF in the salt in a molten-salt reactor and in
the gas phase in contact with it, such as the gas in the
MSRE pump bowl. The HF may react with unplated
metals to produce hydrogen atoms, which then escape
via permeation, but the rates are not known. The use of
chemical gettering by means of oxide in salt quite
probably would lead to a corrosion problem.?

certainly the presence of oil should yield, additionally,

Consequently, unless the hydrogen pressures approach
an atmosphere, only the presence of the radiation field
should permit appreciable reaction of the graphite
moderator to yield methane. |

B. J. Wood and Henry Wise* studied the reaction of
graphite with hydrogen atoms over the temperature
range 450 to 1250°K and found that although hydro-
gen recombination dominated reaction with the graph-
ite, a carbon reaction rate is given by:

even at the relatively high temperature of 1000°K. The
rate of carbon reaction had a maximum of about 5

times this value at 835°K and a hydrogen pressure of 1
torr, but due probably to the thermodynamic in-

stability of methane, at elevated temperatures the rate
was lower. The reaction to produce hydrocarbons

(methane primarily) was attributed to a reaction of
hydrogen atoms with the edges of basal planes in the
graphite sample. Although this work indicates that the
hydrogen-graphite interaction could occur in a molten-
salt reactor, predicting what will occur at reactor
conditions is not yet possible. Similar considerations

gases if present in the reactor should be expected.

13 14 CRYSTAL STRUCT URE OF THE COMPLEX
- FLUORIDE (Na,Ll)-] Th5 F3 1

George Brunton  D. Richard Sears

Among the complex compounds formed from the
alkali fluorides and monoclinic tetrafluorides of the
‘heavy metals, an unusual stoichiometry, 7AF-6MF,
{(where A is an alkali metal and M is a heavy metal, such
as Zr, Hf, Th, or U), occurs. Heretofore, all members of
this class of compounds were found to produce crystals
from the melt which were rhombohedral, space group
R3,

Investigations of phase equilibria in the system
LiF-NaF-ThF, by Thoma et al.! disclosed the occur-
rence of a ternary solid solution, with a host structure
unlike those commonly .observed in such fluoride
systems. Single crystals of this phase were isolated from
frozen fluoride mixtures and subjected to x-ray and
neutron diffraction analysis.

The results of this examination? showed the existence
of the compound (Na,Li), ThgF3, , which crystallizes in
the space group P3cl with g, =9.9056 + 0.0003 A and
co = 13.2820 + 0.0005 A, 25°C (Fig. 13.18). The
calculated density is 6.045 g/cm® and Z = 2, There are
18 atoms in the asymmetric unit. Two independent

Th** ions and F(1) through F(10) are on the general

position 6(d); Th(1) is coordinated by nine F~ and
Th(2) is coordinated by ten F~. Ion F(11) is on
position 2(g). The three sodium ions Na(1), Na(2), and
Na(3) occupy positions 2(c), 2(&), and 2(a) respec-

14.1 DISTRIBUTION OF CERIUM, EUROPIUM,
AND STRONTIUM BETWEEN BISMUTH
AND LITHIUM CHLORIDE

" D.M.Moulton J. H. Shaffer

When solutions of lithium in bismuth are used to
remove rare-earth fission products from an MSBR fuel
salt, thorium will be extracted in about the same
proportion. However, the rare earths can then be
oxidized from the bismuth into a chloride without
disturbing the thorium.! The separation is possible

- because of the relative instability of thorium chloride.

We have examined the behavior of cerium, europium,

‘and strontium in the bismuth—lithium chloride system.

In an earlier experiment an LiF-BeF, salt containing
58.1 g Th and 0.235 g Ce (as fluorides) had been
reduced with a lithium-bismuth solution at 600°C until
all of the Ce and Th were removed from the salt.
Analytical results corresponded to roughly half the
cerium and 10% of the thorium (the latter corre-
sponding to saturation) in the 3 kg of metal. The pot
was cooled and cut open. The top part of the bismuth

slug was cut off to avoid fluoride salt contamination,

and the rest, weighing 2.279 kg, was put into a
graphite-lined vessel with a molybdenum dip tube.

Pure lithium chloride was prepared from reagent-
grade salt by first heating it in argon to 150°C and
holding for 24 hr to remove water. Then HC1 was added
to the Ar, and the temperature was raised slowly to
575°C. The sweep gas was changed to 10% HC1in H,,

and the salt was melted and taken to 650°C. The

H,-HC1 treatment lasted 30 hr, during the last 10 of
which the HCl concentration was doubled. A salt

sample taken after 20 hr showed less than 10 ppm

nickel. Another sample taken after the full treatment
when dissolved in water showed no basicity to phenol-
phthalein, Finally the salt was reduced with pure
hydrogen at 700° till the HC1 content of the effluent
gas was below 0.01 megq/liter.

 

LL.E. McNeese, this report, sect. 1.1.

| Approkimately 1.842 kg of this salt was added to the

bismuth at 650°C. The system was sparged with
H,-HCl at-2 meq/min, and samples were taken after
every 10 meq, using copper filters for the salt and
stainless filters with graphite inserts for the metal.
Analyses were made radiochemically for Ce and spec-

 trographically for Li and Th. The cerium-lithium ratios

are shown in Fig. 14.1, Excluding the values indicated
by open circles, for which the lithium numbers are out
of line, we find log (D¢./D3;) = 8.312 £ 0.384. The
thorium distributions could not be found accurately
because the salt concentration was too low. At the end
of the experiment the hydrochlorination was run for
several much longer periods. The cerium content of the
salt rose to 100% of that expected from the mass
balance, but only about 10% of the thorium appeared,
suggesting that the remainder was not transferred with
the bismuth slug.

- The distributions of eufopium and strontium were

studied in the usual fashion, starting with salt solutions
and extracting them into bismuth. About 2.155 kg of
LiCl containing 76.7 g SrCl;  and 0.153 g EuCl; was
prepared by treating LiCl, StCl; -6H, O, and Eu,0; ina
manner like that for the Ce experiment. The salt was

‘added to 3 kg of Bi at 650°C and reduced first with

6.09 g Th and then 17.16 g Li in increments. Samples
were taken with copper filters and graphite dippers and
analyzed as usual (spectrographic Sr). Strontium and
europium distributions are also shown in Fig. 14.1.
Again the thorium values were unusable. The distribu- -
tion coefficients (Dy,/D};) are given by log Kg, =

' 2.284 1 0.025 and log Kg, = 1.024 £ 0.141.

From these experiments it is obvious that all three of
these fission products will distribute "strongly into

lithium chloride, leaving the thorium behind. Since it

will be very difficult to reextract either europium or
strontium into a second bismuth pool, other methods
will probably need to be used to clean up the chloride
salt. The cerium experiment showed that a controlled
oxidation can be used to strip the bismuth. By doing
this ‘it should be possible to reach a rather high

14.2 EXTRACTION OF CESIUM FROM LITHIUM
CHLORIDE INTO BISMUTH BY REDUCTION
' WITH LITHIUM AT 650°C

~ D.M.Richardson  J. H. Shaffer

Experimental determination of the distribution of
cesium and lithium between bismuth and lithium
chloride when lithium metal is added for reductive
extraction has been made. Knowledge of the behavior of
fission product cesium in this stage of the metal transfer
process is important not only to confirm that cesium
is easily extracted from bismuth into lithium-chloride,
" but also to determine the concentrations of lithium

-which would be required for the back extraction to

bismuth in the final contactor.

The chloride salt was purified by sparging with 4 meq
HC1 per liter of hydrogen in a nickel vessel at 650°C.
Approximately 1 kg of this salt containing 1 mole %

CsCl (labeled with !37Cs) was transferred to a standard

‘4-in. vessel containing 3 kg of hydrogen-fired bismuth
in 2 mild steel liner. Salt samples were taken with
copper filter sticks, and metal samples were taken
through a mild steel dip tube into the bismuth using
~ graphite ladles. Weighed additions of lithium metal were

made to the bismuth through a separate mild steel dip
tube, -and equilibration was promoted by . argon
sparging.

The dlstnbutlon coefficients obtained for cesium
were: log Dpg = log X, ; — 1.503, in which Xj ; is the
mole fraction of lithium in the bismuth phase. The data
are plotted in Fig. 14.2 and are shown with the derived
theoretical line with slope of 1. The point at 0.0054
mole fraction lithium was not used in positioning the
line since the counting rate of that bismuth sample was

. only 21 counts min~! g~!. For comparison, contamina:

tion with 100 ug of salt would elevate the counting rate
by 50 counts/min. In several cases one of the pellets of
a sample pair exhibited a higher counting rate by about

'50 counts/min and was not included in the results

shown. The equilibrium quotient obtained was:
Dcyf/Dy ; = 0.031. This value compares favorably with

" an estimate of 0.019 by D. M. Moulton.!

Spectrochemical analyses of bismuth in the salt- phase
were 15 to 35 ppm and indicate that little or no Li; Bi
was dissolved in the lithium chloride. On the other hand
the high contaminant level in the bismuth (1500 ppm

~copper, 1200 ppm nickel) might be the cause, in the

salt phase, for the oxidation of any bismuthide ions
that were formed. - :

14.3 REMOVAL OF CHLORIDE FROM SIMULATED .,

MSBR FUEL SOLVENT BY REACTION WITH
ANHYDROUS HYDROGEN FLUORIDE

F.A.Doss W.R.Grimes J.H.Shaffer

According to current MSBR fuel reprdcessing tech-
nology, lithium chloride will be employed for the back
extraction of rare earths from bismuth to effect their

separation from thorium.! This close coupling of .

molten LiCl to the reactor system could possibly result
- in the contamination of the fluoride fuel mixture with
chloride ion. Although this event would probably not
affect the physical and chemical properties of the
fluoride mixture, chloride concentrations as low as 20
ppm (1% of Nyr, ) would have a significant effect on

the neutron economy of the breeder reactor. Therefore

an experimental program has been conducted to ex-
amine the feasibility of an HF-H, sparge treatment for
removing chloride from a simulated MSBR fuel solvent
mixture and to provide a basis for preliminary engi-

neering design of a process system, Specifically, equilib- .

rium quotients and velocity constants were determined
for the reaction

- as functions of temperature, HF concentratxons in H2 ,
and gas sparge rates. -

The reaction vessel was constructed from a 16-in.
~ length of 4-in, IPS nickel pipe with welded end closures
of Y-in. nickel plate. Penetrations through the top
plate provided for insertion of a ¥ -in. gas sparge tube
and a thermowell, for gas exhaust, and for withdrawal
of salt samples. Approximately 2.7 kg of LiF-BeF,-
ThF4 (72-16-12 mole %), which had been previously
purified, was contained in a 3%-in.-diam nickel liner
within the reaction vessel. The gas sparge tube extended
to within % in. of the bottom, so that a gas bubble
path of about 5 in, in the salt was created; no other
provisions for salt agitation were made. Chloride con-
centrations of about 1 wt %, introduced as NaCl, were
maintained for analytical expediency.

Samples of the salt phase were withdrawn for chlonde
analyses at the beginning and end of each reaction
period. Acid gas concentrations in the influent and
effluent streams were determined periodically by titra-
tion with standard caustic solutions referenced to the
flow of hydrogen and reaction time. Aliquots of the gas
effluent titration solutions were submitted to the
“Analytical Chemistry Division for chloride analyses.
~ Intermittent concentrations of chloride in the salt phase
were determined by graphical integration of data from
these gas-phase analyses. Seventeen reaction periods of

4 hr each were conducted at 650 and 750°C, at gas
sparge rates of 0.5, 1, and 1.5 liters/min of H, (STP),
and at nominal HF influent concentrations of 3, 5, and
7 meq of HF .per liter of H;. Operation of the
experimental assembly was terminated at this point
because of corrosion of the top plate of the reaction
vessel.

apparent equilibrium constants should approach true

salt phase becomes infinite (zero flow rate). However,
values for K obtained at 650°C varied from about 6 to

14.4 CALCULATED BEHAVIOR OF SODIUM,
RUBIDIUM, AND CESTUM IN THE MOLTEN-SALT
BREEDER REACTOR REPROCESSING PLANT

D.M. Moulton

There will be moderate amounts of rubidium and
cesium fission products in the molten-salt reactor,

_occurring as stable and soluble fluorides everywhere

except in the reprocessing stages. A calculation of their
distribution between bismuth and both fluoride and
chloride salts has been made as a guide to their behavior
until experimental data become available. A similar
calculation has been made for sodium because of the
possibility of mixing of the fuel and coolant salts.

First, standard free energy for the reaction

- MX+Li=M+LiX ' ()
 

 

at 650°C where all substances are pure liquids was

evaluated by adding integrals over the heat capacity and
latent heats to the room-temperature enthalpy and
entropy in the usual fashion. For those substances
melting above 650°C, the integration was carried out to
the melting point and then readjusted to 650°C using
the heat capacity of the liquid. The values were taken

from Kubaschewski et al.! A value of the heat capacity -

for liquid RbF was arbitrarily assigned as C =17.7 cal
deg™! mole™, rather than that generated from the
formula in ref. 1, because of reservations concerning the
original data.? It was also necessary to use a few other
estimated values. |

Activity coefficients were obtained from a varlety of
sources. That for Li in Bi came from Foster et al.? and
was evaluated at infinite dilution of Li. No data were
found for Rb and Cs in Bi, so the excess free energy of
K in Bi was taken from Hultgren et al* and assumed
independent of temperature. The excess chemical po-
tential of Na in Bi was taken from the data of Fischer et
al® and again assumed independent of temperature.
Kleppa and coworkers® have measured heats of mixing
of the lithium halides with those of the heavier alkalies,

all as liquids. Their results are expressed in the form ™
= N;N,(a + bN, + cNN,), where subscript 1 refers to

'Li, and it can be shown that the partial heat of mixing

at infinite dilution of component 2 is given by a + b. It
was assumed that all of the excess chemical potential
was due to the heat of mixing, which was itself
temperature-independent; Kleppa presents some evi-
dence that would justify these assumptions. The free
energy change for the reaction

MX(diss. in LiX) + Li(Bi) =M(Bi) + LiX(lig)  (2)

is the sum of these values. If the final assumption is
made, as suggested by J. Braunstein,” that the ratio of
activity coefficients of LiF and MF does not change
much on the addition of beryllium and thorium
fluorides, then these numbers should allow prediction
of the behavior of sodium, rubidium, and cesium on
both sides of the metal transport step.

coefficients, equilibrium constants, and distributions at

energy is given for reaction (1) and does not include the
activity coefficients. Experimental investigations of
these extractions were initiated recently.®

The calculations should be viewed with some caution
since they involve small differences of rather large

numbers as well as arbitrary assignment of several values

for unmeasured quantities. Nevertheless, on the basis of

these one can make two predictions. First, the heavy
alkalies will be extracted rather well from the fluoride
in the rare-earth removal process. In fact, much of the

- cesium will be detained in the protactinium isolation

system but will probably find its way out eventually.
Sodium will not be extracted very well. Second, all of
these elements will tend to transfer into the chloride
and will not be extracted appreciably even at high Li
concentrations in Bi until their concentration in the salt
gets to be much greater than that of lithium, where the
activity coefficient ratios change. The very considerable

difference between fluorides and chlorides is due

mainly to the extreme stability of LiF, making lithium
metal by far the most powerful reductant in the
fluoride system. LiCl is actually less stable than RbCl or
CsCl; and this is augmented by the rather substantial
heats of mixing of the chlorides, so that the heavier

alkalies tend to stay in the salt phase.

14.5 REDUCTION OF URANIUM AND
PROTACTINIUM WITH TITANIUM

D.M.Moulton -J.H.Shaffer W.R. Grimes

An attempt was made to use metallic titanium as the
reductant for U and Pa with the expectation that TiF;
would be formed and could subsequently be removed as

volatile TiF, after oxidation with HF, leaving the salt .

solvent unchanged. Such a process could eliminate the
need for an electrolytic cell. To a solution of 9.74 g
UF,, 0.16 g Z1F,, and 1 mc of 233Pa in 2.91 kg of

- LiF-BeF,-ThF, (72-16-12 mole %), contained in graph-

ite with 3.00 kg of Bi, was added incrementally 5.05 g
of Ti, or about 2.5 times the equivalence of the U + Zr.
There was no appreciable extraction of Pa either at 600
or 700°C, its maximum distribution being estimated at
0.003. The Pa balance remained close to 100%. Then

0.4 equivalent of Li was added, and the Pa was

extracted as usual. The P2 balance was excellent until
the last addition, where 70% was in the metal but only
15% was in the salt, It may have adsorbed on the Ti,
which was substantially above saturation. No other

analyses were made in this system since it was quite
clear that Ti is not a strong enough reductant to be -
useful.

14.6 BISMUTH-GOLD ALLOYS AS
EXTRACTANTS FOR RARE EARTHS
'AND THORIUM -

D.M.Moulton J. H. Shaffer

Some earlier experiments had suggested that the
addition of gold to bismuth would increase the solu-
bility of thorium, thereby raising both its distribution
and that of the :rare earths. About 2.79 kg of
LiF-BeF,-ThF, (72-16-12 mole %) containing 2.79 g of
CeF; labeled with *#*Ce was placed in contact with
790 g of Bi in a well-bottom pot. All material in contact
with the liquids was graphite except for a molybdenum
dip tube. Thorium metal was added until the Ce
distribution reached the saturation value for thorium in
bismuth. Then enough gold (39 g) was added to bring
its content in the metal up to 5 at. %, and the system
was hydrofluorinated until all the cerium was oxidized,
whereupon the extraction was repeated. Two more gold
additions brought the gold percentage up to 10 and 20
at. %, doing an extraction and hydrofluorination at
each. Dipper samples were used for both phases.

In the first extraction without gold, a cerium distribu-
tion of 0.055 was reached at 600°, agreeing with values
obtained from earlier experiments. At 5, 10, and 20 at.
% gold the maximum values were 0.044, 0.103, and -
0.052. No analyses were made for lithium or thorium.
When gold was present the measured cerium concentra-
tions were somewhat erratic, suggesting that a solid
phase may have formed; this did not happen with pure
bismuth. The addition of gold does seem to increase
cerium extraction, but the improvement is rather small
considering the amount of gold needed. This program is
now being directed toward the use of other alloying
metals to increase the thorium solubility.

14.7 BISMUTH-PLATINUM SOLUTIONS FOR THE
EXTRACTION OF FISSION PRODUCTS

platinum to the bismuth phase upon the reduction of
various fission products. As discussed earlier,! the

formation of an insoluble platinide with zirconium may
be a good way to separate that element from uranium.
An experiment was run in which *$Zr was extracted
into bismuth; a melt containing. 3.48 kg of LiF-BeF,-
ThF, (72-16-12 mole %) and 0.1 wt % Z1F,, labeled
with ®5Zr, was contacted with 800 g of a metallic Bi-U
solution, all at 600°C. When about one-third of the
zirconium had been removed, 11.32 g of Pt was added.
In Fig. 14.5 are shown the percentages in the salt and
the total balance (metal and salt, but excluding any
precipitate) of U and Zr. Several samples were taken
between the Pt addition and the last U addition, and
the results are plotted on the abscissa over the break in
the scale. Filter and dipper samples of the metal gave
different results, indicating a solid phase, The solubility
product X, X3, for the unfiltered samples was about 3

X 10712 except for the last, which was 2 X 10™**, This -
is in reasonable agreement with the value found earlier.

Filter samples would have given still lower values.
It is clear that platinum will separate zirconium from

uranium by forming an insoluble platinide. The ura-

nium balance seems not to be affected. The lithium and
thorium contents of the metal were not greatly altered
by the platinum addition, and the equivalents of Zr lost
from the salt were about equal to the equivalents of U
gained if the valence of U is taken as 4+. In this
- experiment the amount of platinum was slightly less
than stoichiometric to form ZiPt;. Further work is in

progress to determine the effect of excess platinum on
the uranium balance.

Strong compound formation with platinum is not
limited to zirconjum; any of the metals in the early part
of the periodic table should do so, especially those in
the third and fourth groups with empty d orbitals. Asa
result of discussions with Professor Leo Brewer we
decided to see whether this could be used to separate
thorium and rare earths. LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %) with
888 ppm CeF; ‘was used as the salt so that the thorium
balance could be followed. Six grams of thorium metal
in 1-g increments was used to reduce 2.74 kg of this salt
into 800 g Bi. Now platinum metal was added, first
8.23 g and then 7.29 g more, The changes in lithium,
thorium, and cerium distributions and balances are
shown in Table 14.2. Cerium was simply reoxidized
into the salt. There was no measurable change in the
thorium content of the salt, indicating that it probably
precipitated. The change in the lithium concentration
was quite unexpected, and if the reductant balance was
maintained the lithium must have precipitated as well.
About half of the added platinum disappeared, but this
cannot be stoichiometrically related to the lithium and
thorium disappearance since their systems with plati-
num are complicated and not well characterized. -

More lithium was added till all of the cerium was
transferred from the salt to the bismuth. It did not
seem to form a precipitate, Thorium analyses of the salt

constant and low concentration in the metal even under
strongly reducing conditions suggests precipitation. The
platinum balance fell to about 10% by the end of the
experiment, and the product X2 . X, during this part of

the experiment was fairly. constant. The addition of

platinum to bismuth does not seem to help in the
extraction of rare earths, but its interaction with
thorium and lithium will be important in the uranium-
zirconium separation,

148 EXTRACTION OF CERIUM AND THORIUM
FROM LiF-BeF, (66-34 MOLE %)
INTO BISMUTH AT 600°C

J.H. Shaffer D.M.Moulton

Previous experiments have examined the extraction of
rare earths into bismuth from LiF-BeF,-ThF, mixtures

“having constant thorium concentrations of 3, 6, 9, and

12 mole %.! As a continuation of this program, the
extraction of cerium at low and varying thorium
concentrations in the salt phase has been studied. The
purpose of this experiment was to simulate the salt-
bismuth conditions in the proposed electrolytic cell and
to provide data relating to the thermodynamic activity
of ThF, in the salt phase.

- The starting salt mixture was 2.205 kg of LiF (65.75

“mole %), BeF, (33.87 mole %), and ThF, (0.38 mole

%) with a cerium content of about 2.35 X 10~ mole

fraction. This mixture was placed in a graphite-lined

extraction vessel to which 3.00 kg of bismuth had been
added. A total of 10.08 g of lithium metal was added in

tared increments to reduce cerium and thorium from
the salt phase. Samples of each liquid phase were
withdrawn at equilibrium after each addition of lith-
fum. Salt samplés were obtained in copper filter sticks,
and metal samples were filtered through stainless steel
and collected in graphite cups. The results of this
experiment were derived from chemical analyses of the
salt phase for Li, Be, and Th, spectrochemical analyses
of the metal phase for Li and Th, and radiochemical
analyses of both phases for cerium.

The distributions at equilibrium of cerium and tho-
rium between the two liquid phases are related to the
similar distribution of lithium by the equations

The corresponding value for the reduction of thorium
by lithium [Eq. (2)] was 2.59 X 102, The separation
of cerium from thorium (& = D¢, /Dr,,) Was evaluated

Calculations of the material balance for thorium and
cerium during the experiment showed a substantial loss

of cerium from solution in the presence of solid

thorium. Within the accuracy of these data the mole
ratio of cerium to thorium in the solid phase was about

0.0022 while measurable concentrations of thorium and

cerium were in solution in the salt phase, but it
increased to 0.015 after the last addition of lithium to
the extraction system. No further examination of this

~ behavior was made; however, evidence of a solid phase

containing both thorium and cerium was noted by
changes in their concentrations in solution on heating
the bismuth slug from 600 to 700°C in the absence of a
. salt phase during a subsequent experiment.

Although this possible finding of solid solution
formation of cerium and thorium has no practical

significance to the proposed MSBR reprocessing
scheme, it probably precludes further interest in sepa-
rating cerium from thorium in bismuth by cold-zone
deposition of thorium.? The relatively low cerium-
thorium separation factors obtained in this experiment

 further substantiate the “free fluoride” effect on the
‘activity coefficients for thorium in the salt phase.

Values for the equilibrium quotients obtained from this

- experiment will be considered with others obtained in

this program for possible description of the salt
composition effect on the rare-earth extraction process.

Development and Evaluation of Analytlcal Methods

for Molten Salt Reactors

" 15.1 DETERMINATION OF OXIDE IN
MSRE SALT

R.F.Apple J.M.Dale
A.S. Meyer

During the operation of the oxide determination
apparatus at the High Radiation Level Analytical
Laboratory, increasingly high pressures were required to
maintain the flow of gas through the system during

hydrofluorination. This increase occurred across the .

NaF trap used to separate HF from water in the
-effluent gas. It was assumed that during the repeated
absorption and regeneration steps the NaF particles
degraded to form a more tightly packed bed, partic-
ularly at the trap entrance. As the more closely packed
particles swell during HF absorption, the flow is
restricted. A further examination of the system also
revealed that two control valves had become inoperable.
The hot cell was entered, and the NaF trap and the
valve compartment were replaced. Three MSRE salt
samples were received for analyses and were stored in
the hot cell until the necessary repairs to the oxide
apparatus could be made. The results of the analyses are
listed below. A 96% recovery of oxide from an SnO,
standard sample indicated that the repaired apparatus
was functioning properly.

15.2 VOLTAMMETRIC DETERMINATION OF
[U**]/[U] RATIOS IN MSRE FUEL

J.M.Dale R.F.Apple
A. S. Meyer

Work on the zirconium reductions of the simulated
- MSRE fuel at the Y-12 site was temporarily dis-
continued in order to free the voltammeter for use in

the determination of [U“*]I[U*] ratios in MSRE fuel

samples. This work will be continued as time permits.

Fuel sample FP-19-45 was taken on October 6 and
held in a heated carrier until October 16, when the
[U**]1/[U%*] ratio determination was made. Prior to
taking this sample an amount of beryllium equivalent to
0.4% [U*]/[ZU] had been dissolved in the fuel. The
voltammetric determination showed the presence of
0.13% [U*]/[ZU]. Another beryllium addition was

" then. made, which increased the total beryllium U?*

equivalent to 1.16%. After this addition, sample
FP-19-60 was taken on October 20, and the determina-
tion was made on October 22. This determination
showed the presence of 0.07% [U*]/[ZU]. Because .
the determination showed no increase in U*" concentra-
tion, a third sample, FP-19-75, was taken on October
30 and run-on November 11. The determination on this

~ sample showed 0.02% [U*"]/[ZU].

During run 20 of the MSRE, November 25 to
December 12, two beryllium additions were made to
the fuel salt. The U equivalent of the amount of
beryllium dissolved in the first addition was about
1.2%, and that of the second addition was about 1.7%.
It was assumed that at the start of run 20 the U** was
negligible, so 2.9% [U*]/[ZU] was the maximum
amount expected to be present. After the first beryl-
lium addition, sample FP-20-14 was taken and showed
the presence of 0.11% {U"]/[ZU]. Sample FP-20-26, -
taken - after the second beryllium addition, indicated
that 0.20% U>" was present. The reasons for the
discrepancies between the results of U analyses and -
book values are still not completely understood. This
problem will receive further investigation. '

15.3 SPECTRAL STUDIES OF
MSRE SALTS

The acquisition and installation of the hot-cell spec-
trophotometer and related equipment for spectral
studies of molten-salt reactor melts has been completed.

A description of the apparatus and technique originally
devised for carrying out these studies has been given
previously.l»2 The unsatisfactory operation of the
s sample loading furnace, reported in the last progress
report, coupled with the planned shutdown of the
MSRE, caused a marked change in development efforts
. - and required a major design change in sampling and
sample-transfer technique. The original plan required
the removal of a 5-g sample of MSRE fuel from the
reactor. This sample was to be cooled to 200°C for
transfer to the sample loading furnace for remelting and
separation into five separate spectral cells, windowed or
windowless. The cells were then to be transferred to an
optical furnace for spectral study. The entire operation
was to be performed without exposing the MSR fuel to
the atmosphere. The multisample approach had to be
abandoned. Instead, the removal of a sample of MSRE
fuel directly in a spectral cell was considered. Two such
methods of single sample removal were devised. In one,
a windowless or screen cell' would be immersed in the
MSRE pump bowl fuel. Although liquid would run out

of the cell as it is withdrawn from the fuel, a sufficient
quantity would remain if flow rates and reservoir

- volumes were properly selected. In the laboratory, this

approach worked well when such a cell was rapidly
withdrawn from a melt, but its performance seemed
marginal at the withdrawal rate of sample capsules from
the MSRE pump bowl (0.5 in.fsec).

The sampling device used for obtaining MSRE
samples is shown in- Figs. 15,1 and 15.2. In the
exploded view, the small spectral (windowless) cell is
shown at the bottom. This cell fits in the sample
capsule body, the large component to the left. A sleeve,
shown next to the cell, fits over the body and holds the
cell in the capsule body by means of the tab on the
sleeve which fits over the cell. The whole assembly is
held together by the T-shaped key. The assembled
sampler is shown in Fig. 15.2. This capsule assembly is
designed so that the nonwetting fuel salt will flow

freely away from the capsule as it is withdrawn from

the MSRE fuel; likewise, clearances are such that no salt
should be trapped in the various crevices. The spectral
cell is designed, however, to hold melt in two ways. As
the capsule is lowered into the fuel and withdrawn,
melt is caught in the reservoir in the top part of the cell.
On remelting, the cell is turned so that this reservoir
would be up; thus the melt will run into and fill the

lower part of the cell. The capsule is designed so that it
can be disassembled with the one manipulator located
in the sample-enricher station of the reactor. The
spectral cell can then be placed in the sealed transport
container for shipment to the hot-cell spectro-
photometric facility. Although the capsule assembly did
not work as well in the reactor as it had in the
laboratory tests, it was possible to collect three of four
planned spectral samples and have them transferred
properly to the transport container. One of the four
cells could not be removed from the capsule. The
reasons for this are not clear. The original capsules and
cells were made from copper and were hydrogen fired
prior to use. Dipping the capsule in the salt is probably

After installation of the in-cell apparatus and spectro-
photometer components, a nonradioactive MSRE-type
sample was melted to check out the optics, furnace, and
spectrophotometer. The system worked quite well, and
spectra of U(IV) in the molten salt were recorded. In
attempting to transfer the first MSRE sample, a sample
that should have contained no U(III), as it was taken
just after the MSRE went to power on its last run, the
sample loading furnace could not be used to open the
transport container. It was subsequently found that this
transport container had, in all probability, not main-
tained an inert atmosphere around the sample. It was

finally necessary to open this transport container out of

a cleaning operation. It is conceivable that the close fit

of the cell to the capsule body, the elevated tempera-

the effect of high radiation levels caused the com-
ponents to self-weld. After this experience, the cells

“were made of nickel.

The spectral cells were placed in the sealed transport
containers, transferred, and stored at temperatures
above 200°C in the hot cell until the spectro-
photometer and sample transfer and handling apparatus
were éompleted. The revised system was designed so

- that the spectral cell was positioned in a bottom cap of

each transport container. This sealed bottom cap was to
be removed inside the sample loading furnace. The cell

would then be-shifted on a turntable to another
- position within this furnace to be picked up by a

sealable lid assembly for final transfer, under inert
atmosphere, to the spectral furnace for meltmg and
spectral study.

ture, the cleanliness of the similar metals, and perhaps |

the sample loading furnace. The spectral cell was
transferred in air to the spectral furnace. Although the
furnace atmosphere’ around the sample was carefully
evacuated and purged prior to melting the sample, on
melting no real spectral evidence of U(IV), or U(III),
was observed. It .is possible that the U(IV) was
precipitated as UO, while it was stored in the faulty
transport container. :
After repair and mechanical strengtherung of parts of
the sample loading furnace, another sample, MSR

- 20-30, was brought to this furnace. The transport

container which held this sample was opened without
problem, and the spectral cell, a nickel windowless cell,

- was transferred as planned to the optics furnace. This |

particular sample was taken at a time when the
U(IIT)/U(IV) ratio was believed to be about 2.8%, based
on additions of Be®. At this level, the visual color of the
melt should have been quite yellow. On melting, the
solution appeared to be light green in color, definitely
not “yellow. Although the solution appeared -to be
 

 

 

somewhat turbid, spectra were obtained that demon-

strated the existence of U(IV) in the melt. The
turbidity of the solution, with attendant light loss,
resulted in some loss of resolution of individual peaks,
but over all the spectrum of U(IV) in the wavelength
range 300 to 1600 nm was quite similar to that
reported for U(IV) in nonradioactive LiF-BeF,s> this
sample of MSRE fuel, approximately 200 mg in size,
had a radiation level of about 75 r. The heights of the

absorbance peaks were consistent with a U(IV) concen-

tration in the sample of about 0.12 mole %. Further
studies of this sample are planned to see if U(IH) can be
grown into the MSR fuel by radiolytic evolution of F,
gas at room temperature or by chemical reduction of
U(IV) by uranium metal.

15.4 TRITIUM IN THE EFFLUENT
GASES OF THE MSRE

J.M.Dale R.F.Apple
A.S.Meyer

"During the operation of the MSRE in the latter part

of run 19, analytical equipment was set up in the MSRE
- vent-house sample station in order to measure the
concentration of tritium in the various reactor effluent

gas streams. A fractional part of the gas stream being

analyzed was passed over a bed of hot copper oxide in
order to convert the tritium to water. In general, two
copper oxide temperatures were used, one at ~340°C
and the other at ~800°C. The higher temperature
allows the oxidation of methane, while the lower
temperature does not. After oxidation the gas stream
was passed through a bubbler tube which contained a
few milliliters of water and then through an empty trap

which was cooled to about —80°C. Two sets of traps

‘were used to ensure that all of the tritium was being

collected. Sample streams were controlled at about 100

‘em®/min to which 3 cm®/min of natural hydrogen was
added as a carrier for the tritium. The amount of
tritium collected for a specified period was determined
by a liquid scmtlllatlon technique. -
~ The system was checked with a standard gas- of
known hydrogen and methane concentrations. It was
determined by both gas chromatographic and mass
spectrographic analyses of the standard effluent from
the copper oxide at 800°C that the hydrogen and
methane were completely oxidized.

Table 15.1 shows the results obtained durmg the last
- week of run 19.

An attempt was also made during run 19 to determine
the concentration of tritium in the coolant stack air
with the existing analytncal setup. This was precluded
by the residual amount of tritium in the amalytical
system and sampling lines from previous analyses.
Although the amount of tritium found in these analyses
was comparatively small (microcuries), the factor for
converting to curies per day (1.38 X 10%), due to the
large air flow in the stack, greatly magnified any
sampling errors. For this reason a new sampling system
was installed during the shutdown period between run
19 and run 20 so that.a more concentrated sample
could be taken. A sheath was installed on a 2-ft section
of a radiator tube and was fitted with tubing so that air
could be drawn through the sheath for sampling.

On November 21, about three weeks after the end of

mun 19, two samples were taken from the fuel off-gas

system. At this time the pump bowl was empty of salt,

~and the helium flow through the system had been

dropped from 4.2 liters/min to 2.4 liters/min. The
results obtained from the low- and high-temperature
analyses were 3.15 and 7.44 curies/day, respectively, an
appreciable amount compared with that found when
the reactor was at full power.

- Table 15.2 lists the fuel off-gas analyses obtamed
during run 20, ©

The analyses made on December 2, after about one
week at power, indicated that the total tritium concen-
tration had not built up to the values found in run 19

of the sample taken on December 12, the day of the
reactor shutdown, is not known.

into evacuated bulbs which contained about 1 ml of

- water. The gas samples, taken on December 11, were

dynamic studies in molten fluoride salts. A nickel—
nickel fluoride reference electrode? contained in thin-
walled boron nitride was developed for emf measure-
ments in molten fluorides at a working temperature of

about 500 to 550°C. At hlgher temperatures, the BN

deteriorates rapidly. _
In view of the limitations of the BN container
material at the higher temperatures, a somewhat new

'concept for a reference electrode for fluoride melts is
" under investigation. The authors independently fol-

allowed to equilibrate with the water, and the tritium

. was counted. These results are shown in Table 15.4.

Samples 1 and 2 were taken through a tube which
extended 3 ft into the base of the stack. The tube
extended 18 ft into the stack for samples 3 and 4. The
only apparent explanation for the difference between
the results of Table 15.3 and Table 15.4 is that the
sampling was not equivalent for the two methods.

_ 15.5 REFERENCE ELECTRODE STUDIES
IN MOLTEN FLUORIDES

D.L.Manning H. R. Bronstein

- A simple and stable reference electrode would be very
useful for electroanalytical measurements and thermo-

lowed rather similar paths in this study, and only the

most promising electrode system which evolved from

combining our individual experiences is reported here.

The new approach to the problem involves the use of a -

single crystal of LaF; as the ionic conductor between
the reference compartment and the melt being in-

‘vestigated. At the temperatures of interest, 500°C and

above, single-crystal LaF; has sufficient ionic con-
ductance, almost completely supplied by the mobile
fluoride ion, so that any liquid-solid junction potential
would tend to be minimal if the melts on either side of
the crystal were essentially the same. Two models of
the electrode are presently being tested. One model is
similar to Egan’s approach® where an Ni/NiF, pellet is
press-fitted with a nickel electrode against one face of
the LaF; crystal (~% in. in diameter and % in. thick).
The other face of the crystal fits against a fine-porosity
(<5 u) nickel frit welded into the bottom of a nickel

sheath. The electrode assembly is contained inside the

nickel sheath (some are copper) but separated from the
sheath with boron nitride machined to provide insula-
tion between the nickel container and the crystal. The
purpose of the ﬁne-poromty nickel frit (% in. in

diameter and %, in. thick) is to protect the crystal, as
much as possible, from undue etching by the molten
fluoride. Once the melt inside the frit at the frit-crystal
interface becomes saturated with LaF;, then further
attack on the crystal should be minimized due to the
slow rate of diffusion of the melt in the frit. The other
form of the electrode is similar except that the LaF,
crystal is in the form of a small cup which contains the
same molten fluoride salt as the test melt but saturated
with NiF,. Contact to the melt in the cup is achieved
with a small nickel electrode. The saturated NiF,
solution (10”2 mole fraction) in the cup would hardly
alter the slight solubility of LaFa (1 to 2 mole % by
analogy to CeF3).

Preliminary observations were made by immersing the
electrodes in molten LiF-BeF; and LiF-BeF,-ZrF,
saturated with NiF,;. The emf of the cell should be
zero, Essentially zero (+10 mv) was obtained in molten
LiF-BeF,; however, an excess potential of ~190 + 10
mv was observed in molten LiF-BeF,-ZrF,. This
potential was stable for several days. The stability of
the electrode is encouraging; however, the source of the
extra potential remains to be resolved. '

Another test was made to observe the effectiveness of -

the nickel frit in protecting the LaF, crystal. The
crystal lost 5% of its weight after 40 days exposure to
molten LiF-BeF,-ZrF, at 500°C. These studies will
continue, and it is also planned to test the stability of
the electrode in a reducing melt, namely, a melt that
contains a high [U*]/[ZU] ratio.

15.6 REMOVAL OF OXIDE FROM NaBF,
R.F.Apple A.S. Meyer

The study of methods for removing oxide and water
from molten NaBF, was continued. A pot containing
2600 g of NaBF, was treated with He-BF;-HF
(50-50-180 ¢cm®/min) for 16 hr at 900°F, Titrating the
effluent gas from the melt with Karl Fischer reagent
indicated that about 100 mg H,O per hour was being
removed by this method. Samples were removed prior
to and after hydrofluorination and analyzed for oxide
and water: .

15.7 A PRELIMINARY STUDY OF
VOLATILE AICl, COMPLEXES

J.D.Lodmell'  A.D.Horton
| A.S.Meyer

A series of experiments were performed to determine
whether volatile AICl; complexes of the chlorides of
MSRE fuel constituents might be applicable to MSRP
technology. The basis for this investigation was a report
by Gruen and @ye? that complexes of the type
NdCl,:(AICl3),, exhibit significant vapor pressures (~17
mm- at 700°C) at AL Clg pressures of about 3 atm.
These preliminary studies were made to determine
whether the complexes could be used for analytical
separations of rare-earth fission products and to in-
vestigate the possibility of separation of fission
products from chloride reprocessing streams generated
by the Metal Transfer Process.?

The volatilization tests were made in a quartz tube
that contained weighed quantities of chlorides (NdCl;,
EuCl;, and LiCl) in a platinum or quartz boat. These
chlorides were exposed to a stream of helium (~100
cm®/min) that had been contacted with AICl; near its
sublimation temperature. Because of plugging problems .
the concentration of AICl; in the helium carrier was
limited to about 10%. The chlorides were exposed to
the gas stream for periods of about an hour at

~ temperatures up to 750°C.

With one exception, in which the exit end of the tube

plugged and .an unknown pressure of AICl; was

generated, no significant distillation of the rare-earth
chlorides was observed. Traces of rare earth were

~detected in the AICl; condensate, but weight losses of

~ the chloride samples were negligible. (Minor losses may

have been obscured by deposits on the boats.) This

-behavior at lower AICl; pressures appears consistent

with the complex being formed with the unstable dimer

Al Clg and with @ye’s suggestion® that several Al,Cl,

molecules are involved in the complex.

Conversely, LiCl distilled quite readily. A llqllld
condensate was observed in the cooler portions of the
tube when the temperature of the LiCl reached about
500 to 550°C. Distillation of 0.5 g of LiCl was

. complete in less than 1 hr at 600°C. The condensate

was analyzed and found to correspond to LiAICl, with
about 20% excess AlCl;. A 1:1 volatile complex of

NaCl with AICl; has been reported.® The LiCl was

quantitatively removed (~99%) from 0.4 g of a 30:1
mole ratio Li/Nd mixture of the chlorides in about 40
min at 600°C. _
On the basis of the above experiments it was
suggested that the system be investigated for potential

‘application to MSBE fuel reprocessing. In a possible

separation scheme the chloride salt from the metal
transfer process (principally LiCl containing rare earths

in concentration enhanced over thorium) would be
subjected to AICl; distillation, with the rare-earth
chlorides remaining in the residue. The volatilized
LiAICl, would then be decomposed, with the LiCl
returned to the metal transfer equilibration system.

Evaluation would require equilibrium constant measure-

ments of the various chloride complexes including

- thorium, a study of the effects of AlCl; contaminant

on the efficiency of the metal transfer process, and an
evaluation of the possibility of contamination of the
fuel by aluminum.

An evaluation by the Chemical Technology Division®
indicated that the application of this process to the
main reprocessing stream of the reactor would require
the distillation of prohibitive quantities of salt. Accord-
ingly, further study of these complexes has been
assigned a low priority. .

~ Part 5. Materials Development

Our materials program has concentrated on the
development of graphite and Hastelloy N with im-
proved resistance to irradiation damage. We have

approached the graphite problem by studying the -

dimensional changes during irradiation of several com-

mercial graphites. These studies have revealed which -

graphites are most stable and, additionally, have shown
what preirradiation properties are important in making
some experimental graphites that likely will have
improved dimensional stability during irradiation. The
graphite used in an MSBR must also be sealed to reduce
“the permeability to gaseous fission products. We are
developing techniques for sealing graphite with carbon.
The fast flux seen by the Hastelloy N is quite low,
and the irradiation damage to this material is associated
with the production of helium from the transmutation
of 1¢B by thermal neutrons. The threshold boron level
required to cause embrittlement is too low to be
obtained commercially, so we sought to reduce the
problem by changes in alloy chemistry. Modified
compositions of Hastelloy N containing additions of Ti,
Hf, and Nb look promising. The improved properties

are associated with the formation of a fine dispersion of

type MC carbides, and we are studying how the carbide

type changes with alloy composition and aging.

The compatibility of Hastelloy N with fluoride salts
continues to receive attention; the main emphasis is
currently placed on the proposed coolant salt, sodium
fluoroborate. ‘This salt is more corrosive than other
fluoride salts; we attribute this aggressiveness to the

presence of adsorbed moisture. The variation of cor-

rosion rate with moisture content and methods of
removing moisture from a flowing salt stream are being
studied. ' | .

Some work has begun on developing structural
materials suitable for use .in the chemical processing

- plant. In this application the materials will be exposed

to both salt and bismuth. Nickel-base alloys are highly
soluble in bismith, and iron-base alloys mass transfer
very badly. Molybdenum seems compatible, but it is
difficult to fabricate. One avenue of research involves
methods_of coating steels with molybdenum or tung- -
sten to protect them from the bismuth. A second area
of endeavor is that of finding brazing alloys that are
compatible with bismuth for joining molybdenym.

16. MSRE Surveillance Program

H.E.McCoy  W.H. Cook

- We maintain a surveillance program in the MSRE to
follow the property changes that occur in the graphite
and Hastelloy N used in fabricating the experiment.
There are surveillance positions in the core and outside
the reactor vessel. Graphite and Hastelloy N are
included in the core surveillance facility. The deposition
of fission products on both materials is studied (see Part
~ 3 for the results). The fluence received by the graphite
is quite low, and the dimensional changes have re-

188

mained undetectable by the measuring techniques that
we have available in the hot cells. The fluence is high
enough to change the mechanical properties of the

~ Hastelloy N, and we have run both tensile and creep

tests to follow these changes. Metallographic studies are
performed to follow corrosion. Only Hastelloy N
samples are in the facility outside the vessel. The
samples more nearly reflect the condition of the reactor
vessel. Hastelloy N of the same heats used in fabricating

the MSRE has been used in the surveillance program,
and some additional alloys of modified compositions
have been included.

The Hastelloy N samples removed to date from the |

MSRE are summarized in Table 16.1. The details of
tests on the first three groups of samples have been
presented previously,'™® and the present discussion will
concentrate on the Hastelloy N samples demgnated as

group 4.
16.1 PROPERTIES OF I-IASTELLOY N
SAMPLES REMOVED FROM THE MSRE .
H. E. McCoy

As discussed previously' the metal samples removed
after run 18 (designated group 4) were discolored. The
‘straps that held the surveillance assembly together were

examined and found to contain cracks up to 3 mils -

deep. We examined unstressed samples from the sur-
veillance rods and found that they also had a modified

structure to a depth of 1 or 2 mils (Fig. 16.1). Samples

exposed to static barren salt for the same period of time
did not have the modified structure  (Fig. 16.2). To
~ determine qualitatively what effect this structural

change would have on the mechanical propertiés, we

bent a test sample at room temperature. The photo-
micrographs in Fig. 16.3 show what occurred. On the
tensile side of the sample, cracks formed that pene-
trated about 4 mils. On the compression side there was
no cracking.

Several of the mechanical property samples were -

examined metallographically after testing to determine
the behavior of the modified microstructure under

uniaxial testing at 25 and 650°C. At a test temperature

of 25°C, the fracture was primarily intergranular in the
irradiated sample (Fig. 16.4) and primarily trans-
granular in the unirradiated sample (Fig. 16.5). There
was a large amount of edge cracking to a depth of about
-4 mils in the irradiated sample (Fig. 16.4), but there
- was none in the unirradiated sample (Fig. 16.5). At a
test temperature of 650°C the fractures were inter-
granular in both unirradiated and irradiated samples.

The irradiated sample (Fig. 16.6) had edge cracks to a
depth of about 12 mils; the unirradiated sample (Fig.

' 16.7) had fewer cracks. The fact that the irradiated

sample strained only 5% and the unirradiated sample
24% before failure should be considered in comparing

‘these photomicrographs. That the sample that strained

the most had fewer edge cracks indicates. that the
structure modification of the irradiated samples caused
added embrittlement near the surface.

- We know that the oxidation potential of the salt was
relatively high during some of the time that the samples
were in the reactor. This should remove chromium from
the specimen surfaces, and indeed we observed that the

- chromium concentration of the salt did rise. However,

this should not embrittle the metal, nor should it pro-
duce the modified microstructure. We are using several
techniques to identify chemical changes near the
surface. This work is incomplete, and we will report the -

- findings later.

~ The tensile properties of the standard Hastelloy N
samples removed from the core with group 4 were
reported previously.? The creep tests have been com-

pleted on these materials, and the properties will be

compared with those obtained at other fluences. The
stress-rupture properties at 650° for heat 5085 are
shown in Fig. 16.8 for various fluences. The data for
the control samples show that the rupture life decreased
with increasing aging time at 650° to 15,289 hr and
then increased slightly with further aging for 22,533 hr.
The irradiated samples show a decrease in rupture life
with increasing thermal fluence up to 9.4 X 10%°
neutrons/cm?. No further deterioration occurred with

~an increase in fluence to 1.5 X 10%! neutrons/cm?.

This behavior is as expected, since these two fluences
represent boron burnups of 87 and 90% respectively.
This small difference should not be detectable in the
properties that we measure. The minimum creep rate

‘measurements shown in Fig. 16.9 show that neither
- irradiation nor aging has an appreciable influence on the
- minimum creep rate. The possible exception is at very

high stress levels; however, these samples failed at such
low strains that they likely are still in the primary creep

- stage and have not reached the secondary or minimum -

creep rate stage. The fracture strains for these samples

. are shown in Fig. 16.10 as a function of creep rate. The
- fracture strain decreases progressively ‘with increasing

fluence. However, the remarkable fact is that the
unirradiated samples have fracture strains of 15 to 30%
and that the lowest fluence studied reduced the fracture
strain to 2.5%. This fluence produced a helium content
of about 1 ppm in this heat of matérial.

All of the results that have been presented are for
heat 5085 (used to make the cylindrical shell of the
MSRE). Heat 5065 (used to make the top and bottom
heads of the MSRE) has been included in the program,
and its performance parallels very closely that of heat
5085.

Several heats of modified Hastelloy N have been
included in our program, and detailed mechanical
property tests similar to those just described for heat
5085 have been run. The results have been reported,* S
but Fig. 16.11 summarizes the performance of some of
these new alloys. All of the modified alloys have
rupture lives approaching those of standard Hastelloy N
in the unirradiated condition. The minimum fracture

strains vary from 0.5% for standard Hastelloy N to 6%
for alloys modified with 1.1% titanium or 0.49%
hafnium. None of these alloys shows any evidence of
higher corrosion due to the addition of these elements
that are easily oxidized. However, as we have discussed
previously, most of these alloys do not retain their good
properties when irradiated above 700°C. Thus further
chemical modifications are needed to obtain an alloy
suitable for service at 700°C (see Chap. 18 for further
details on this work).

17. Graphite Studies

W. P. Eatherly

The purpose of our graphite program is to develop

graphites that are suitable for use in molten-salt
reactors. The graphite in these reactors will be exposed

to high neutron fluences and must maintain reasonable
dimensional stability and mechanical integrity. Further-
more, the graphite must have a fine pore spectrum that
will exclude salt and a very low permeability to gaseous
fission products, notably !3%Xe. Our initial approach
to the problem of dimensional stability during irradia-
tion has been to evaluate all of the commercial products
that look potentially acceptable. This study has been
done carefully and systematically, so that the respective
importances of several variables have emerged. Physical
property measurements, x-ray studies, and electron
microscopy have greatly supplemented the interpreta-
tion of the results.

We have found commercial graphites that wﬂl per-
form acceptably in a moltensalt breeder reactor, but
our studies offer encouragement that graphites with
improved resistance to irradiation damage can be

_ developed. Our ideas are being used in a small fabri-

cation program to produce test samples of potentlally
better graphites.

The problem of obtaining low gas permeability is
being approached by gas impregnation with a hydro-
carbon. This problem is not independent of the
dimensional stability of graphite, since differential

. changes in dimensions of the impregnated material

relative to the base graphite can increase the per-

_meability. We have developed several techniques for

obtaining low permeabilities, but the stability of the
structures under irradiation will largely govern the
choice of process.

17.1 FUNDAMENTAL STUDIES OF RADIATION -
DAMAGE MECHANISMS IN GRAPHITE

D K. Holmes S.M. Ohr
W.E. Atkinson  T.S. Noggle

The earlier studies of “in situ” damage in graphite due
to the ijlluminating beam of the 200-kv electron
microscope had demonstrated that extensive damage

H. E. McCoy, J1.

occurred; however, the detailed nature of the observed
structures could not be determined, since the contrast
behavior did not systematically vary in a manner that
permitted analysns Recent work employing a dark-field
technique to monitor and study the damage has
considerably improved the sensitivity to the appearance

~ of damage clusters and provides unambiguous evidence

that the damage clusters are d1slocat10n loops of

~ interstitial type.

These pbservatlons are being extended to evaluate the
effect of irradiation temperature, dose, and electron

energy on the size, density, and nature of the damage

clusters and the incubation time for their appearance.
The increased sensitivity of the dark-field method to
presence of the damage clusters compared with bright-
field observations leads to apparent incubation periods
approximately a factor of 2 shorter than previously
reported. In addition, it has been found that irradiation -
with 150-kv electrons leads to damage clusters; how-
ever, the incubation period is 2 to 3 times longer than
.the incubation time for 200-kv irradiations. This obser-
vation of damage from 150-kv electrons suggests that
the threshold energy for. displacement of carbon atoms -
is lower than the value of 33 ev reported in the
literature.

At this time the experimental techniques being
employed are able to generate information which can
be compared with the theoretical model developed
which treats the kinetics of the nucleation and growth
of interstitial clusters. This model is based on the work
of Mayer, who advanced the hypothesis that boron
plays a critical role in the nucleation of interstitial
clusters. For the experimental observations to test or
suggest changes in the theoretical treatment, it is

~ necessary that graphite containing known amounts of .

boron be studied. The availability of good graphite
crystals has been limited, and boron-doped material has
not been available. To obtain an adequate supply of
material, rock containing graphite single crystals was
obtained from the Lead Hill graphite mine at
Ticonderoga, New York, and chemical dissolution of

 the calcite matrix is being carried out to free the natural

single crystals. Preliminary x-ray studies have indicated

200
 

 

 

that the material obtained contains excellent single
crystals. Purification, followed by doping with boron,

~ will be carried out on this material to give specimens

suitable for testing the theoretical model as to the role
of boron in the formatlon of the interstitial damage
clusters. S

17.2 PROCUREMENT OF NEW GRADES
OF GRAPHITE

W. H. Cook

.One of the initial objectives of our graphite irradia-
tion studies was to obtain types of graphite that were
typical of all variations in nuclear graphite technology.
To a large extent we have accomplished this. For this
reason our rate of procurement has slowed. Our current
procurement 'is directed toward (1) obtaining newly
developed grades and (2) acquiring additional stock of
the few grades that have shown the most resistance to
radiation damage. The latter procurement is to supply
materials for more detailed investigation of these
grades. The different grades of graphite are used to
extend our knowledge of the behavior of graphite in
neutron irradiation. This involves new startmg materials
and new fabrication processes. '

We have acquired three grades of pitch-bonded
lampblack material, grades $20,! L31,' and SA45.?
Grade S20 has been fired only to a carbonization
temperature, while grades L31 and SA45 have been
fired to graphitizing temperatures. Grades S20 and L31
are being evaluated in our irradiation studies. The
purpose is to determine the potential of these poorly
crystallized materials for use in graphite bodies under
MSBR conditions.

‘We have a sample of grade HS-82-3 fine-grained

17.3 GENERAL PHYSICAL PROPERTY
‘'MEASUREMENTS

W.H. Cook

We raﬁ a cursory set of physical property tests on the
new graphites to determine if they are potentially

cursory tests help us choose the grades that warrant
more extensive testing. Table 17.1 is a summary of
some of the cursory test data. _

Group 1 in Table 17.1 is a series of materials from
Poco Graphite, Inc. Grades AXF-5Q! and AXF-5QBG
have been the most resistant to radiation damage at
715°C of all grades tested to date.? The latter is an
impregnated and graphitized product of grade AXF-5Q.
Their good resistance to irradiation damage warrants
more extensive studies. The grade AXM-5Q is of
particular interest in the series, since it was crushed to-
pro'vide the filler materials for the study of special
binders.> The grade AXF-5Q-UFG is the same as the
standard grade AXF-5Q except that the starting ma-
terials have appreciably smaller grain sizes.

Group 2, from Great Lakes Carbon Corporation, is a-
comparison of “raw coke” graphite made in the
laboratory, grade H364, and in a pilot plant, grade
H337, by impregnating and graphitizing the base stock
grade JOZ. Grades H364 and H337 have been the
second most resistant to radiation damage.? The im-
pressive point is that the base stock had an apparent
density of only 1.57 gfem®, which was increased to
1.94 to 2.00 g/cm® by multiple impregnations, and that
the final product showed relatively good resistance to
radiation damage.

The grades of group 3, from Speer Carbon Company,
as a class are not as isotropic as the materials in the first
two groups; however, they were included in the
irradiation studies because of special types of startmg
materials.

Group 4, from the Graphite Products Division of
Carborundum Company, consists of all fine-grained

- grades of graphite that are even more anisotropic than

the previous three groups. This degree of anisotropy
makes these have low potential for MSBR core material.

The limited gas permeability data continue to em-
phasize the problems of attaining low permeability. The
common grades have helium permeabilities greater than

1072 ¢m? /sec, and the special grades tend to be in the

useful for MSBR’s or if they can contribute to our

understanding of irradiation damage in graphite. These

17.4 GRAPHITE FABRICATION
R. L. Hamner

Our goal is to fabricate high-density isotropic bodies
for molten-salt reactor applications. We fabricated
bodies by warm uniaxial pressing and by isostatic
pressing. These bodies were then impregnated to in-

.crease density. The characteristics of - the starting

materials and the results of our fabrication studies
follow. :

17.4.1 Characterization of Matetials

Four grades of filler materials were used:

1. JOZgrade graphite powder (Great Lakes Carbon
Corporation), derived from a petroleum coke, un-
impregnated, base stock produced commercially.
Our interest in this material was evoked by the
irradiation behavior of grade H337, which is made
from the impregnated base stock.

2. Graphitized Robinson coke, air-blown graphite
powder (Carbon Products Division, UCC) which
does not form a needle-ike structure and, therefore,
may be amenable to the fabrication of isotropic
bodies. :

3. Santa Maria coke (Collier Carbon and Chemical
Corporation), which is reported to result in bodies
similar in unirradiated properties to the Poco
grades

4. Thermax (R. T. Vanderbilt Company, Inc.), a

submicron spherical carbon black, which is used
frequently to enhance the packing characteristics of
graphite particles in a fabricated body.

These flours (excépt Thermax) have been charactet-

distribution, helium density, and surface area. Inter-
layer spacings and crystallite sizes are now being
determined by x-ray diffraction. :
By metallographic examination the JOZ powder
appears -to ‘be the most graphitic of the group but
contains more needlelike particles in the finer frac-

~ tions; the larger particles of all the materials: are

relatively blocky; the Santa Maria flour has peculiar
“pinwheel”shaped areas which tend to break down
into short needles in the finer fractions. Other charac-

terizations are shown in Table 17.2. A coal tar pitch -

(Allied Chemical Company, grade 15-V) was selected as
a binder for initial work, but only the fraction soluble
in benzene at 80°C was used. As determined by our
experiments, about 20% insolubles, which are presumed
to be impurities and higher-meiting pitches, were
filtered out of the pitch. The coking value as de-
termined in an open boat in flowing helium was 33% at

- 1000°C. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that ap-

proximately 89% of the volatiles escaping during
carbonization were given off between 200 and 500°C.

17.4.2 Fabrication by Hot Pressing

The technique of fabricating by warm uniaxial
pressing was selected, since it yields a product similar to
extruded bodies because of the orientation effect but
requires less time and materials. Billets nominally 3 in.
in diameter and 2.75 in. high were pressed in a graphite

- die at 1600 psi and approximately 1100°C; these were

then graphitized at 2800°C (unpressurized) and im-
pregnated ‘with pitch to increase density. The charac-

. teristics of the pressed billets are shown in Table 17.3.

The densification due to Thermax additions is apparent.
Crystalline anisotropy was determined by a qualitative

~check which compares the maximum diffracted in-

tensities obtained from the basal planes in flat thin
specimens having the same thickness and whose faces
are  perpendicular to and parallel with the fabrication
axis. This technique is probably sufficient for the initial
development stages of our fabrication studies. The
isotropy of the Robinson billets was far superior to that
of either the Santa Maria or the JOZ billets: the latter
showed the greatest anisotropy, probably because of
the needle-like particles in the ﬂour which promote
preferred orientation, '

‘We performed multiple impregnations on specimens
from these six types, as shown in Table 17.4. Our

impreghation Ilarocedurewas to evacuate the specimens
for 1'%, hr, then impregnate the specimens with coal tar

~ pitch in an autoclave at 160°C and 500 -psi for 1 hr.
_ After the final impregnation the specimens were heated
- at 2800°C to graphitize the impregnant. In general, for

the same number of impregnations, specimens having -
initially higher bulk densities had higher final densities
and reached their maximum density with fewer im-
pregnations.

It is well known that carbon ylelds from binder (or

impregnant) materials can be extremely variable and

seem to depend on carbonizing conditions as well as on
filler materials. The major variables affecting carbon
yield are not well defined. OQur carbon-yield experi-
ments on the 15-V coal tar. pitch alone have produced
values ranging from 25 to 33%, even though the samples
were from the same batch of pitch and run under the
same conditions. _

We determined carbon ylelds of the pltch after each
impregnation. Although there are some anomalies in the
data, we observed generally that as the density in-
creased, the carbon yield increased. We have no
explanation for this, but we feel that such phenomena

must be studied in the interest of improving fabncatlon
techniques.

The permeability of the JOZ-2 family was measured
on a machined HFIRtype specimen at 1 atm He. The
value obtained was surprisingly high in view of the bulk
density of the specimen. Pertinerit data for the spec-

imen are compared in Table 17.5 with those obtained

on extruded Varcum-bound specimens which are now

being irradiated in HFIR. Specimens for measurements

by mercury porosimetry were cut from the same rods
from which the permeability specimens were machined.
These data show that bulk density alone is not a good
indicator of permeability and that the materials in-
volved must be considered. It appears that the mode of
filling open pores is different for Varcum and pitch, as
might be expected, Varcum being the better sealer
material. Here, again, the need is pointed out for study
of the behavior of binder and/or impregnant materials.

Specimens from the ROB-5 body were submitted as
candidates for irradiation because of their favorable
anisotropy ratio of 1.00.

17.4.3 Fabrication by Isostatic Pressing

~ We selected the JOZ and Santa Maria materials for
isostatic molding since these materials had an unsatis-
factory anisotropy factor when fabricated by warm
pressing. Compositions were formulated with and with-
out Thermax additions and with 25 pph coal tar pitch
as binder. The flowsheet for processing the isostatically
pressed bodies is given in Fig. 17.1. -

- After isostatic pressing, the pellets were nominally 1
in. in diameter and 2.25 in. long. The pellets expanded
slightly during carbonization (approximately 3 vol %),
probably because of gas release from the pitch. Im-
pregnation procedures were the same as for the warm-
pressed specimens except the pressure was increased to
1000 psi.

Table 17.6 shows the increases in bulk densities of the
specimens with successive impregnations. Note that the
densities of the unimpregnated specimens are much
lower than the same compositions that were warm
pressed; this is to be expected. Also the densification
due to Thermax additions is apparent, although with
successive impregnations this effect became less pro-.
nounced. Carbon yields from the impregnant were
determined after each impregnation. As in the case of
the warm-pressed specimens, the carbon yields in-
creased with successive impregnations. :

The specimen is a 1.0-<cm-diam by 7.8-cm-long circular
cylinder. One end of the specimen is clamped in a
nickel base, and the free end contains a copper heater
assembly with a 560-ohm heater. A nickel guard:
cylinder with a heater on the free end surrounds the

- specimen. Both the guard cylinder and an outer nickel

furnace are bolted to a nickel base which rests on a base

heater. This heater is thermally and mechanically
attached to a water-cooled heat sink with three nickel
tubes. The annuli between the guard cylinder and

specimen and between the guard cylinder and outer .
furnace are filled with a fine Al,O; powder of known

thermal conductivity. The entire assembly of Fig. 17.2
is enclosed in an environment chamber which is capable
of vacuums to 10™3 mm Hg or inert gas pressures up to
1500 mm Hg. '

A single thermal conductivity test consists of at least

two thermal conditions at. the same average temper-

ature. One of these is an “isothermal” calibration! of
the measuring thermocouples 8, 9, 10, and 11 with no
power to the specimen heater. The others consist of
determining the gradient along the specimen when a
known amount of dc power is being dissipated in the
specimen heater. Both configurations are obtained with
the specimen heater and guard cylinder heater at the

same temperature and with the outer furnace from 5 to
10° cooler than either. An important test parameter —

the thermal conductivity of the gas-powder annuli —
can be easily varied by changing the gas pressure in the
system. The two thermal configurations permit calcula-
tions of the specimen thermal conductivity, A, and
Seebeck coefficient from each of the three sections.
The sample electrical resistivity can be obtained at any
temperature by passing a reversible direct current
‘through the sample and measuring the voltage drop
across adjacent thermoelements.

This device has been tested from 50 to 480°C on an
Armco iron standard. The deviations between the
measured values of A and the values calculated for the

Samples of H337 and Poco AXF graphites are being
prepared for preirradiation measurements. These sam-
ples will then be irradiated in HFIR to various fluences
from 550 to 700°C. The effects of the irradiation and
postirradiation annealing on the thermal conductmty
of these samples will be determined.

' 17.6 X-RAY STUDIES
O.B.Cavin J.E. Spruiell

We are concerned with the determination of accurate
lattice parameters, crystallite sizes, and crystalline
anisotropy of potential MSBR graphites and the result-
ant change in these properties, if any, after irradiation
in the HFIR. Previously we showed the importance of
the x-ray anisotropy parameter in the interpretation of
the radiation-induced growth rates at constant volume.!
We have continued this work on commercial materials
utilizing spherical samples, and we are using this tech-
nique on experimental graphites being made at the Y-12
Plant? to follow the effects of altering fabncatlon vari-
ables and filler.

The results in Table 17 .8 show that a change in

anisotropy was observed when materials were graph-
itized at 2800°C following processing at 2200°C. All of
these materials were hot pressed at 2200°C and 2400
psi and had Santa Maria coke as filler with isotruxene
binder. The data were obtained from the same sphere

before and after the high-temperature graphitization.

became more isotropic; the magnitude of this change
was directly proportional to the starting degree of
anisotropy. ' | ,

Another interesting finding has been that changes in

anisotropy occur when graphite is joined by brazing

with molybdenum at high temperatures under pres-
sure.> We determined the changes in anisotropy of ‘
extruded stock near the braze from spherical samples
whose poles were at the positions indicated in Figs.
17.3 and 17.4. The discontinuity in the curve could be

. correlated with a discontinuous temperature gradient
-during brazing.

- Computer programs have been written to correct the
x-ray data obtained from the Bragg maxima for

calculation of lattice parameters and crystallite sizes.
The data are corrected for background scatter, Lorentz
polarization, structure, temperature, and sample trans-
parency factors. Sample transparency is a very major
contribution to the position and shape of x-ray line

~ profiles.* Instrumental contributions to the profiie
~width and shape are subtracted out by.the method of .

17.7 ELECTRON MICROSCOPY OF
GRAPHITE

C.S.Morgan  C.S. Yust

‘Specimens of hot-pressed - pyrolytic graphite and
Ticonderoga natural flake graphite have been examined
in an effort to relate the features observed in these
more ‘perfect lattice arrangements to those seen in the
complex polycrystalline structures. Dislocation images
and extensive moir€ patterns were readxly observed, as
were the modification of these features by variation of
the diffraction conditions. The thicker the foil ex-

‘amined, the greater the number of dislocations and
moiré patterns observed, due to the increase in the
number of planes on thch dlslocatlons and misorienta-
tions can exist.

~ The exammatlon of polycrystalhne samples by trans-
mission electron microscopy involves the passage of the
electron beam through many layers of graphite between
which substantial misorientations may exist. The elec-
tron waves transmitted through the polycrystalline foil
would be expected to experience some modifications
which might obscure detection of some of the defects
which may exist in the lattice. To date, however, there
has not been any observation of dislocations in the
polycrystalline foils, a result which is not fully under-
stood but which may result from the propensity of
dislocations in small grains to move to the grain surface.

Polycrystalline specimens of graphite examined by
electron transmission microscopy are found to contain
regions of aligned lamellae, or domains. Within the

209

difference between specimens thinned by mechanical
polishing and specimens thinned by electrochemical
methods. The sharply reduced evidence of lamellae in
the mechanically polished irradiated foils suggests that
the graphite is harder after irradiation. Irradiated
specimens exhibit many dots of the orderof 1000 Ain
diameter, the origin of which has not been determined
(but see Sect. 17.1). They are found to be reduced in
number by a 1-hr anneal at 2400°C.

17.8 GAS IMPREGNATION OF GRAPHITE
C. B. Pollock

We have been studying techniques for manufacturing
graphite with very low helium permeability by sealing
the surface with pyrolytic carbon. Our objective is to
obtain a graphite with a surface permeability of 107°

cm? [sec or less to prevent the absorption or retention
of agapr'ecmble amounts of fission product poisons such

l Sxe

Commerclally avallable graphltes suitable for use in
the core of an MSBR presently have helium per-
meabilities of 10™* cm?/sec or greater. Beatty de-

“veloped a technique by which graphite can be sealed

domain regions the ¢ planes are approximately parallel,

but wide variations of orientation may exist around the
¢ axis. Lamellae illustrating domains are made evident
by microcracks occurring during mechanical polishing
but reflect substructure properties of the graphite.
Studies have indicated that. the expansion due to
neutron irradiation may be related to the domain size.
For example, the domain size of AXF graphite is
smaller than that of H337 graphite, and the macro-
scopic effect of irradiation is less in AXF than in H337.

One  of the prominent features observed in the
* polycrystalline foils is 2 banding effect on the lamellae.
Study of the moiré patterns in the more perfect lattices
suggests that at least in some cases the bands are moiré
- patterns. The fact that the band patterns are limited to

the width of the lamellae may be related to the overlap
of adjacent layers. ‘

The examination of irradiated graphlte has been
extended to several graphites irradiated to a neutron
fluence around 3 X 1022 neutrons/cm?. The transmis-
sion electron micrographs of these specimens show little

with pyrolytic carbon to the desired levels." We have
now completed the third irradiation of graphite speci-
mens sealed in this manner. Results from two earlier
irradiation tests were misleading in that the cleaning
operation (ultrasonic cleaning) is thought to have been
harmful to the specimens. In the third experiment, 27
specimens were irradiated to fast-neutron fluences
ranging from 5.2 to 139 X 10?! neutrons/cm? at a
temperature of 715°C. Base stock graphites investigated
in this experiment included Poco AXF graphite and
Great Lakes Carbon Company grade H337 graphite.
The specimens were gas impregnated by the vacuum-
pulse technique to helium permeabilities ranging from

35X 1077 to 2 X 107 c¢m? [sec before irradiation.

The first measurements taken after irradiation were
the helium permeabilities. Results were found to range

‘from 4.27 X 107® to as great as 10™* c¢m?fsec. Helium

permeability of the specimens as a function of fluence
is plotted in Fig. 17.6. The gasimpregnated H337
graphite had an appreciable -change in helium per-
meability at about 8 X 10%! neutrons/cm?®, while
drastic change in the gas-impregnated Poco graphite
appeared to occur at about 1.0 X 10?? neutrons/cm?.

Helium permeabﬂntles of the spemmen appeared to be

the higher fluences. No variable other than fluence

- appeared to exert any appreciable influence on the

postirradiation helium permeability values. _
Superficially the increases in helium permeability
observed in this experiment are. somewhat disappoint-
ing. However, let us consider how the helium per-
meability was obtained. The equations used to calculate
the helium permeability and the sample geometry are
shown in Fig. 17.7. We used the entire wall thickness of
If we
assumed that the permeability was controlled by a
surface layer of perhaps 0.004 to 0.04 cm, then the
calculated values for helium permeabﬂlty of that layer
would decrease by one or two orders of magnitude
below the values plotted in Fig. 17.6. Our preirradiation

. values for helium permeability would decrease to less

than 10 cm?/sec, and the postirradiation -values
would be less than 10”7 cm?/sec, or very close to the
desired levels. Previous radiographic studies of sealed
samples indicated that the highest density of deposited

210

carbon is very near the surface.® Thus there is strong
justification for using the smaller values for the thick-
ness £,

Dimensional changes were also measured on these
samples as a function of fluence. Figure 17.8 is a plot of
the fractional length and diameter changes as a function

material. The data points on gas-impregnated graphite -

were taken from this experiment, and the data points
on ummpregnated base stock graph1te were collected
from a number of other experiments.>

We conclude that the dimensional changes of the

gasimpregnated graphite are equivalent to those for
- unimpregnated graphite out to the maximum fluence

studied. Apparently the amount.of carbon being added

to the graphite (maximum of 10% by weight for Poco
graphite) does not cause appreciable change in the
behavior of the graphite bodies at these fluences.

The irradiation testing of a number of specimens from
this experiment is to be continued in the next HFIR
irradiation experiment. We wish to observe the behavior
of the specimens under higher neutron doses for several
reasons. First, we would like to know if the helium

permeabilities of the specimens continue to increase
beyond the present level of 1075 cm?/sec or if they
level off as Fig.-17.6 suggests. Second, we would like to
observe the progressive changes in helium' permeability
in several specimens presently exposed to lower neutron
doses. From these results one could draw conclusions
regarding the manner in which fast-neutron fluences
affect helium permeabilities. Are we observing changes

_in the impregnated carbon, or is the graphite matrix
opening up? Hopefully, future results will shed light on

this question.

Pyrolytic carbon coatings that are potentially useful
at moltensalt reactor fluences have been developed
recently by D. M. Hewette of the Carbon Development
group. Samples coated with isotropic pyrolytic carbon
derived from propylene have been exposed to fast-
neutron fluences of up to 2 X 10?2 neutrons/cm? at
715°C with remarkable dimensional stability (see Sect.
17.10). A number of graphite samples have been coated
with similar pyrolytic carbon coatings and then therm-
ally cycled from 25 to 1800°C with no apparent
damage. Since the properties of the coatings and the
graphite base stock are similar in the temperature and
fluence range anticipated for MSBR’s, coating may be a
better way to achieve low permeability than impregna-
tion.

For the next HFIR experiment we have prepared a

- number of coated specimens for irradiation testing. All
were coated with isotropic pyrolytic carbon derived
from propylene at 1300°C in a fluidized bed and then

were heat treated at 1800°C after coating. All speci-

- mens have helium. ‘permeabilities less than 107

cm? Jsec. Figure 17.10 is a photomicrograph of the
out81de coating of such a sample, illustrating the lack of
porosity and the excellent bond between base stock
material and coating. Figure 17.11 is a polarized light
view of the coating and shows that it is isotropic. We
plan to investigate the influences on permeability of the

- base stock material and coating thickness in this

experiment.

We have continued to study scalmg up the gas-pulse
carbon impregnation system. One significant problem
has been the extremely poor efficiency of gas utiliza-

‘tion. With the present system only that portion of the
- hydrocarbon that is in close proximity to the work

piece is utilized for carbon deposition. The remainder

* of the hydrocarbon and the hydrogen generated in the .
process are wasted. To improve the efficiency we

developed a simple gas-recycle system. The exhaust gas
from the system is collected in a condenser maintained
at a temperature below the boiling point of butadiene.
A vent line allows the hydrogen to escape. The

butadiene thus collected is then recycled, and gas
. utilization efficiency has increased at least tenfold.
-Also, some preliminary experiments have been con-
ducted using a steady-flow gas-impregnation system
rather than the gas-pulse system. We have found that in
order to avoid excessive tar formation, it is necessary to

use a very dilute hydrocarbon--carrier-gas mixture (0.5

to 2.5% by volume of hydrocarbon). Our studies show
that Poco graphite can be sealed to helium per-
meabilities of less than 107 cm? /sec in approximately
3 to 5 times as long as by the gas-pulse system.
However, a system of this type could be easily designed
to handle a number of moderator blocks, whereas the
gas-pulse technique could handle more than one only
with difficulty. It would appear to be much simpler to
scale up a steady-flow system than a gas-pulse system.

17.9 HFIR IRRADIATION PROGRAM
C.R.Kennedy

HFIR graphite éxperiments 9 and 10 have beeﬂ ‘

removed from the reactor and have been replaced by
experiments. 11 and 12. The newer materials added to

213

 the irradiation program and included in these experi-

ments are given in Table 17.10.

‘Graphite grades 586, 588, ABS-5, ABS-6, YMI-3, ™
350-10, YMI-13, and YM 350-11 are all made with
isotropic cokes and fabricated by molding or extrusion.
These grades were made to evaluate the binder systems
in an attempt to obtain materials with properties similar
to those of the Poco grades but fabricated by methods
that could be used to make large moderator elements.
The grinding of the coke or the fabrication process did
impart some degree of anisotropy into these graphites.
As noted by the results in Fig. 17.12, there is very little
difference between the respective grades 586 and 588,
YMI-3 and YM 350-10, and YMI-13 and YM 350-11.
We also note that these grades have lost the initial delay
in the densification process that is characteristic of the
Poco grades. Therefore the lifetime for these materials
would be considerably less than the Poco graph1tes and
similar to more conventional graphites.

We also note that the densification is less for these
materials than for the conventional needle or acicular
coke graphites. This is shown in Fig. 17.13, where the
densification is shown to be a function of the original

density. There are two significant exceptions to this
behavior: grades YM 350-11 and YMI-13 do not
densify. However it is seen that these graphltes made
from isotropic particles do not, as a class, have the same
potential for densification as the needle or acicular coke
‘graphites. This behavior suggests that the porosity
responsible for shrinkage is external to the particle or
the binder shrinkage cracks. This is because the growth

within an isotropic particle would havé a -greater
potential for removal of the porosity within the particle

than a highly aligned particle. Also, much of the
“differential growth within the isotropic particle is
absorbed, and the result is that only small particle shape
changes are available for reducing the binder shrinkage
cracks. On- the other hand the needle coke growth,

because of the high alignment of the particle, is
~ available for closure of the binder shrinkage cracks. This

behavior, coupled with the fact that the two hot-
molded graphites, grades YM 350-11 and YMI-13, do
not have binder shrinkage cracks and do not exhibit a
densification, suggests strongly that the porosity-

- controlling densification is a result of binder shrinkage

during processing. These observations suggest that the
increase in life by a delay in the densification process is
most likely to be obtained by use of a binderless
isotropic graphite such as the Poco grades or the raw
coke H364.

It is also interesting to compare the growth rates of
these graphites with the needle and acicular particle
graphites. We can again use the growth rates when the
volume - change with respect to fluence is zero' for
comparison with R, the preferred orientation param-
eter.! This is done in Fig. 17.14, showing that the
growth rate for the Poco graphltes is about 3 times

higher than for the needle coke graphites. This behavior
is consistent with previous observations of Bokros?
showing that the growth rate increases with decreasing
crystallite size. Preliminary measurements® indicate the
Poco graphites and flour have a much smaller crystalhte
size than the needle coke materials.

The microstructures of several grades of graphite were
examined by both the optical and the electron micro-
scope. The samples were also evaluated using the
quantitative microscope (QM), which yields the fraction
of void area and the number of voids. The results are
given in Table 17.11. The void area fraction generally is
in very good agreement with the percentage of acces-
sible void volume that we determined by helium density
measurements. The number of voids is not an absolute
number because of the irregular shapes of the voids; the
same void can be counted a number of times. The num-

- ber is only relative and is not significant except for large

_changes. The fact that the void volume results obtained

by the QM are in excellent agreement with helium den-
sity and bulk density changes is fairly direct evidence

that virtually all of the ac_cessible void volume is visible
in the microscope. It is the inaccessible void volume

components or phases in the graphite structure. Upon
irradiation these very low-density phasés (approxi-
mately equal to 1.5 gfcm®) densify to about 2.1 gfcm®
and leave a large void volume in the graphite. If there is
a large amount of the low-density phase, the increase in
void volume is not observable from bulk volume
changes but can be deduced from helium density
measurements. The magnitude of this type of behavior
is illustrated in the micrograph of grade 1425 in Fig.
17.15. The bulk density change of the irradiated sample
is only 1.8%; however, the void volume has increased by
over 9%, An example of a material where the increase in
void volume is equal to the bulk volume change is grade

17.10 TRRADIATION BEHAVIOR OF
PYROLYTIC CARBONS

D. M, Hewette II C.R. Kennedy

Bulk graphites consist of at least two graphitic
constituents, filler and binder, that have widely dif-

- ferent properties: large crystallite size and ‘high density

for the filler and smaller crystallite sizes and low to
intermediate densities for the binder. To predict how
these bulk graphites behave under irradiation, one must
know how the different constituents will behave.

- Deposition of pyrolytic carbons in fluidized beds
offers 2 means of obtaining homogeneous structures
having properties that scan the extremes found in bulk
graphites. The pyrolytic carbons, however, are not
completely graphitic and have a turbostratic disorder of
the layer planes. Irradiation of these types of materials
furnishes a means of obtaining densification and

17.11 CALCULATION OF LIFETIME AND
INDUCED STRESSES IN MSBR
GRAPHITE CORES

S.J. Chang

To analyze the effects of fast-neutron damage on the
core graphite of a moltensalt reactor, three methods
have been developed and discussed earlier.! The im-
pulse-type analysis, the most general of the three, has
been further developed to lift restrictions on the
crosssectional shape. The method can thus be used to
analyze effects of geometrical shape, boundary traction,
thermal properties, and neutron-induced dimensional
changes provided only that the creep coefficient and
the neutron flux not be sensitive to position over a
given cross section. The analysis is based on the
constitutive equatlons of the form?

is the coefficient -of thermal expansion, T is the
temperature distribution, ¢ is the neutron-induced
dimensional change, D is the neutron dose, and K(7)) is
the creep coefficient from the uniaxial creep test.

If the creep coefficient K(7T) is assumed to be a
constant, independent of temperature, and the tempera-
ture-dependent neutron-induced dimensional change is
given by :

VO, T)= 4, D + 4,(DD,

then the stress, and therefore the strain, of the
two-dimensional problem of arbitrary shape can be
expressed as a linear combination of several fictitious

~elastic solutions with the same cross section. From this

result the problem of an arbitrary shape can be solved,
provided that solutions of the elastic problems are
available.

To apply the method to the- prehrmnary design
calculation, numerical results were obtained for the
core graphite, which was assumed to be in the form of
long cylindrical tubes. Then the design lifetimes of the
cylinders were evaluated based on two criteria, one by
volumetric distortion and the other by axial strain, The
specific problems solved were concentric circular cyl-
inders with inner radius g, outer radius b, length L, and
b/a = 6.667. Several values of b ranging from 4 to 6 cm
were used to illustrate the geometric influence.

The material parameters used were: '

stress components can be calculated easily if their
values at D = 1022 nyt are known.

As the definition of graphite life, it has norma]ly been

assumed the material will generate macroscopic cracks . '.

after it begins to significantly expand beyond its
original dimensions. We may define two ad hoc life-

" times, first the fluence at which the material returns to

its original volume and second, the fluence at which its
axial strain returns to zero. The resulting lifetimes as a
function of axial position in the core are shown in Figs.
17.24 and 17.25. It is seen the critical section occurs at
Z[L = 0.57, approximately, and that the axial strain
criterion to define lifetime is slightly more severe.

As mentioned previously, the creep coefficient K(T)
‘was assumed to be constant in this analysis. More
realistically, the above method is being generalized to
account for a temperature-sensitive K(7). The analytical
analysis has been completed, and numerical results are
being computed.

18. Hastelloy N

H. E. McCoy

The main shortcoming of Hastelloy N for use in
molten-salt reactors is its embrittlement due to neu-
tron irradiation. We have found that this embrittlement
can be reduced by the addition of Ti, Hf, and Nb. Our

work during the past months has concentrated on

optimizing the concentrations of these elements. Small

‘lab melts of about 2 Ib have been used for this purpose,

and some 50--and 100-b commercial melts are being
obtained of the compositions that look promising. Our
evaluation includes postirradiation mechanical property
tests, long-term aging, and welding studies.

Two compatibility questions are receiving attention. -

First, the compatibility of Hastelloy N with steam must
be evaluated. Samples are being exposed in two test
facilities. Second, the compatibility of Hastelloy N with
our new proposed coolant salt, sodium fluoroborate,
must be evaluated. This work involves capsule tests,
thermal-convection loops, and a single forced-convec-
tion loop. Since the corrosion rate seems to be
influenced by the water content of the sodium fluoro-
borate, work is in progress to develop a process for
removing water from the salt.

18.1 AGING OF MODIFIED ALLOYS
C. E. Sessions

Our previous studies have involved a comparison of
the aging effects at 650 and 760°C of commercial heats
of titanium-modified Hastelloy N. We showed' from a
statistical fit of the tensile data that the results
predicted the following: (1) a post-age ductility increase
with increasing titanium concentration in the alloy, (2)
a small decrease in strength and ductility with aging
times greater than 1500 hr, (3) significantly lower
ductility after aging at 760°C for each titanium-modi-
fied alloy, and (4) a minimum in strength and maxi-
mum in ductility between 0.5 and 1.2% titanium.

 

 

1€, 8. Lever and C. E. Sessions, MSR Program Semiann.
Progr. Rept. Aug. 31, 1969, ORNL-4449, pp. 18384,

We have further investigated the effects of titanium
and molybdenum content on the aging behavior of
small laboratory- heats in order to check these trends.
Figure 18.1 shows the 650°C yield strength plotted as a
function of titanium and molybdenum content before
and after aging at 760°C. In an Ni—12% Mo-7%
Cr—0.06% C base composition, the yield strength
increases for the first 0.1% titanium but does not show
a continuous strengthening trend between 0.1 and 1.0%
titanium. For most titanium concentrations, however,
the 650°C yield strength is increased by aging 1500 hr
at 760°C. In contrast to this behavior, the yield
strength increases rapidly with increasing molybdenum
concentration from 10 to 20% in the Ni—7% Cr—0.06%
C base alloy (Fig. 18.1). The yield strength is also
increased by aging 1500 hr at 760°C in these a]loys
with varying molybdenum content.

The tensile ductility values of these two alloy series
are compared in Fig. 18.2. For tests in the assolution-
annealed condition (1 hr at 1177°C), there is no effect
of titanium on the 650°C tensile ductility. However,
after aging 1500 hr at 760°C, the beneficial influence of
titanium is apparent. As in the case of commercial

alloys,!** the post-age ductility increases with titanium.
The results indicate that for titanium contents <0.5 the

ductility decreases on aging at 760°C and for titanium

contents >0.5 the ductility increases. This behavior as a
function of titanium was previously shown to result
from the stability of the MC-type carbides at 760°C as
determined by the titanium concentration in the alloy.?
The influence of molybdenum on the ductility after
aging is also shown in Fig. 18.2. In the solution-

- annealed condition there is a ductility decrease at 20%

molybdenum for alloys containing between 10 and 20%

molybdenum. When aged 1500 hr at 760°C, each alloy
shows a significant loss in ductility, with the exception .
of the alloys with the lowest (10%) and highest (20%)

molybdenum contents. The carbide phases precipitated
in these alloys at 760°C are M,C> for concentrations

~ up to 20% molybdenum, where we get M C carbides at

650°C* and likely at 760°C also. Thus apparently we

- get the smallest ductility loss on aging when MgC is
-precipitated, although when M,C is precipitated, the

detrimental effect is smallest at the lower molybdenum

concentrations. This might possibly indicate that the

influence of titanium content on the 760°C aging

behavior would be greater at higher molybdenum
concentrations than we find from our studies of the
12% molybdenum alloys (Figs. 18.1 and 18.2). This
conclusion is based on the observed larger ductility loss
attributable to M,C precipitation at 14.5% molybde-
num in Fig. 18.2.

Additional aging studies are in progress on new alloy
compositions which will be discussed at a future date.
The microstructures developed on aging the commercial
titanium-modified alloys have been discussed previ-
ously; however, some recent results in Figs. 18.3—18.6
give the optical microstructures after 10,000 hr aging at
650 and 760°C. Figure 18.3 shows samples aged after a
solution anneal of 1 hr at 1177°C, Fig. 18.4 shows
samples annealed 1 hr at 1260°C and aged, Fig. 18.5
shows a sample with stacking fault precipitates, and Fig.
18.6 shows two alloys aged after a pretreatment of
1177°C plus 10% strain at room temperature. In general
the precipitation that occurs at 650°C in each alloy is
finer than that at 760°C. The grain boundary precipi-

‘tate appears to be coarser and more widely spaced at

760°C. The structures produced by solution anneals at
1177 and 1260°C are not appreciably different, as
found by comparing Figs. 18.3 and 18.4, with one
exception. In Fig. 184 the acicular structure after the
760°C age for the 1.2% titanium alloy corresponds to
precipitates on stacking faults,® as shown by electron

- microscopy,? and this microconstituent did not develop

as profusely if the material was given a preage anneal at
a lower temperature of 1177°C (Fig. 18.3).

A lower-magnification optical photograph of precipi-
tates on stacking faults in a heat of Hastelloy N
containing 1.2% titanium after 3000 hr at 760°C is-
shown in Fig. 18.5. The concentration of stacking fault

. precipitates is fairly heavy near grain boundaries, and

the presence of twms does not appear to affect their
formation.

~ The influence of prestraining 10% at room tempeta-
ture on the microstructure developed during aging is
shown in Fig. 18.6 for the heats containing 0.15 and

1.2% Ti. Precipitation appears to be heavier at 650°C in
‘the low-titanium heat as compared with Fig. 18.3, but

the effect of prestrain is insignificant at 760°C. In the

- heat containing 1.2% titanium, prestraining has en-

hanced precipitation at both 650 and 760°C, but
particularly at 760°C. The effect of prior straining, as
judged from Fig. 18.3, has been to promote the acicular
type of precipitate which corresponds to precipitates on
stacking faults. Thus stacking fault precipitation is
enhanced by prestraining after an 1177°C anneal as well
as by raising the solution annealing temperature from
1177 to 1260°C.,

18.2 EFFECT OF CARBON AND TITANIUM
ON POSTIRRADIATION PROPERTIES

C.E.Sessions H.E. McCoy

Defining the influence of alloying on the high-temper-
ature irradiation damage is one objective of our alloy
development studies on Hastelloy N. To study optimum
titanium and carbon concentrations in Hastelloy N, an

irradiation was conducted in the ETR at a design

temperature of 600°C to a thermal fluence of 2 X
10?° neutronsfcm?®. The design temperature, however,
was not achieved, and the temperature of the irradia-
tion was determined from observations on melt wires to
be approximately 550°C. Postirradiation creep-rupture
tests were conducted at 650 and 760°C after this
irradiation, and the results are. presented in Figs.

18.7—18.9. Six commercial heats of Hastelloy N with

the titanium and carbon contents given in Table 18.1
were used. They included three levels of titanium (0.6,

09, and 1.2%) and two levels of carbon for each
titanium level, with the high carbon content being
nominally 0.08% and the low carbon content 0.03%.
Figure 18.7 gives the postirradiation stress-rupture
properties of the low-carbon alloys for each titanium
level. The numbers associated with each data point are
- the total fracture strains. At the low carbon level, the
lowest-titanium heat (67-553) has a shorter rupture life
at both 650 and 760°C, as expected. However, the two
higher titanium levels show approximately the same
rupture ‘lives. Thus at low carbon levels no particular
“advantage is gained by increasing the titanium from 0.9
to 1.2% when the irradiation temperature is as low as
550°C. Generally, the ductility is greater at lower stress
levels for a given alloy. In Fig. 18.8 the results for the
high-carbon heats for these same three levels of tita-
nium are presented. The results are very surprising,
- since they indicate a maximum postirradiation creep-
rupture life at 650 and at 760°C for the 0.6% titanium

heat (67-550). Equally surprising is the fact that the
lowest creep-rupture lives were found for the 0.9%
titanium heat (67-549) and that properties intermediate
between the 0.6 and 0.9% titanium heat were measured
for the 1.2% titanium heat. Since the scatter in these
test results does not appear to be excessive for a
particular alloy (i.e., good straight lines can be drawn
through the data), we must conclude that the role of
titanjum at high and low carbon contents is quite
different. These results are consistent with the hypothe-
sis that above 0.6% titanium in Hasteloy N the
irradiation damage (postirradiation properties) at 550°C

is independent of the titanium level; however, we have
previously shown that this hypothesis is not true for
irradiations at 650 and 760°C. Nevertheless, the nature
of the irradiation damage produced at 550°C has not
been previously evaluated in detail, and the possible
complication of carbide precipitation during postirradi-
ation testing (for a 550°C irradiation) could mask our
previously observed beneficial mﬂuence of higher tita-
nium concentrations.

1.2% titanium level on the postirradiated properties of
Hastelloy N. These data, replotted from Figs. 18.7 and )

new alloys that were recently tested in postirradiation

‘creep rupture. Each alloy has the base composition

Ni—12% Mo—7% Cr—4% Fe—0.2% Mn—0.06% C, with
various minor additions of Ti, Nb, Zr, Hf, or Si as listed
in Table 18.2. We can evaluate the relative benefit of a
given combination of alloying elements by comparing
the creep properties after irradiation.

Figure 18.10 compares the results of stress-rupture
testing for these new alloys with those for standard
irradiated Hastelloy N. These data were obtained at

650°C after irradiation at 760°C to a thermal neutron
“fluence of 3 X 10?% neutrons/cm?. These particular

test conditions have been shown to reflect the sensi-
tivity of postirradiation properties to alloy content.!

As expected from previous results, alloy 284, which
contains no Ti, Nb, Zr, or Hf, had inferior properties
compared with standard Hastelloy N. Alloy 286,

containing additions of 0.5% niobium + 0.2% titanium,

was no better than standard Hastelloy N. However,

altoy 301 (0.8% hafnium) and alloy 315 (0.5% titanium
+ 0.05% zirconium) both appear to be considerably
better than the standard alloy in terms of rupture life
and fracture strain. . _

Alloys 289 and 290 both contain about 1.0% tita-
nium, but the properties were no better than standard

_ Hastelloy N. As discussed previously! the specimens

with approximately 1.0% titanium showed a large
variation in creep properties after irradiation at 760°C
that we do not yet fully understand. However, these
two alloys at 30,000 psi stress had high postirradiation
ductility, For increasing alloy content, alloy 232 (1.2%
hafnium) is particularly good, with a 13% fracture
strain in a creep test at 40,000 psi. Alloy 303 is an
outstanding alloy composition for additions below

' 1.5%. This alloy contained 0.5% titanium and 0.8%

niobium and was tested at 47,000 psi. The postirradia-
tion rupture life was a factor of 100 higher than that
for standard Hastelloy N. Even at 55,000 psi the
ductility and rupture life were excellent for this alloy.

Alloys 181 (1.8% niebjum + 0.5% titanium), 184
(1.2% titanium + 1.2% hafnium), 291 (2.0% titanium),
 

 

 

231

and 300 (0.8% Ti—1.3% Nb—0.7% Hf) had excellent -

postirradiation creep properties. Of these four alloys

tested to date, alloy 184 is far superior, with 23%

fracture strain for creep at 35,000 psi. These recent
results on alloys with 2% titanium are also quite
encouraging and indicate that titanium additions alone
can probably produce the desired mechanical behavior
during service at 700°C.

‘Alloys with higher concentrations of titanium of 2.4

and 3.0% (alloys 292 and 293) exhibited very high
creep resistance at this test temperature. The very low
creep rates and low rupture ductilities of these two
alloys probably indicate that these compositions pre-
cipitate gamma prime (Ni; Ti) type intermetallic com-
pounds during irradiation at 760°C. If this proves to be

. true, we would not be interested in alloys with such

high titanium concentrations,

18.4 ELECTRON MICROSCOPY OF MODIFIED
HASTELLOY N ALLOYS |

R.E.Gehlbach S.W. Cook

Electron microscopy studies of Hastelloy N have
concentrated primarily on characterizing the effects of
alloying additions on the microstructure of several
modifications of the alloy after exposure at elevated
temperatures, namely, 650 and 760°C. The resistance
to radiation damage is altered markedly by the addition
of small amounts of Ti, Nb, and Hf. Silicon is also
important in determining the type of precipitate
formed. The concentration of this element is controlled
largely by the melting practice, being high (0.5%) for

-alloys prepared by electroslag remelting! or air melting

and low (<0.1%) for vacuum-melted alloys. The molyb-
denum concentratlon in the base alloy is also nnpor-

_ tant.

Laboratory Heats. — A number of 2-Ib laboratory
melts were prepared to evaluate the influence of Ti, Nb,
Hf, and Si on precipitation and the resistance to
irradiation damage. Several of these alloys have been
aged at 650 and 760°C. Precipitates were extracted
electrolytically and identified by x-ray diffraction. The
alloys with their compositions and the pl‘eClpltateS
detected are listed in Table 18.3.

‘The effects of titanium additions on precipitation
have been discussed previously.?*® Precipitation of MC
carbides® often occurs in a stacking fault morphology
at -titanium concentrations up to the 1.2% level.
Examination of an alloy containing 2.4% titanium
(292) that had been aged 200 hr at 760°C revealed the
absence of this morphology, although much MC (g =
4.29 A) was present as films and very fine particles in
the .jagged grain boundaries and as particles in the

- matrix. Gamma prime (Ni;Ti) was not detected in this

material.

The effects of small amounts of niobium, of titanium

niobium and 0.23% titanium (alloy 286) resulted in a
finer grain boundary precipitate (Fig. 18.115b) than that
observed in the alloy without titanium (285). The

carbides are very stable and are not dissolved during
annealing as described previously.® After the silicon is
consumed in the MgC, which contains about 3.3%
silicon, further grain boundary carbide precipitation is
similar to that in the silicon-free alloy (286), although
smaller amounts are present. Relatively small carbides

also precipitated in the matrix in alloy 287. Some

precipitate occurred in the stacking fault morphology in
alloys 286 and 287, containing titanium, but not in 285
or 306, which do not contain any titanium, There is
some question regarding the structure of the stacking
fault precipitate observed in the alloys containing
niobium. Aging at 650°C resulted in much finer M, C
than that generated at the higher temperature (760°C).
In addition to large quantities of M4C, a small amount

of very fine MC was dispersed throughout the matrix in
306 after aging at 650°C; however, only M;C is present
after aging at 760°C. '

The MC formed in hafnium-modified alloys has a
morphology different from that in the titanium-
modified alloys. Figure 18.12z is typical of an alloy
containing 0.7% hafnium (alloy 313) aged 200 hr at
760°C. As shown in Fig. 18.12b, 0.15% titanium and

0.57% niobium in combination with hafnium (alloy
310) did not significantly affect the morphology of the
carbides formed at 760°C. A comparison of Fig. 18.12b
with Fig. 18.11b shows the effect of hafnium at
comparable levels of titanium and niobium. A similar
microstructure was previously shown for an alloy
containing 1% hafnium and 1% titanium (alloy 184).2

0.65% Ti, 1.3% Nb, and 0.65% Hf (alloy 314) resulted
in large stable Mg C in the matrix and grain boundaries
with subsequent precipitation of fine MC (Fig 18.12¢)
similar to the silicon-free alloys. Due to the high level of
silicon in 314, much of the carbon was tied up in the
M,C, with little available for MC precipitation during
aging. No stacking fault morphology was found in the
hafnium-modified alloys. '

- Commercial Alloys. — We have examined the phases
present in four new commercial alloys (Table 18.4).
Two are electroslag remelted  heats containing 0.77%
titanium and 1,7% niobium (heat 69-344) and 1.1%

titanium and 0.92% hafnium (heat 69-345). Both

contained high concentrations of silicon and had large
amounts of MgC after annealing. Small quantities of
MC were also present in both alloys.

Precipitates in the two vacuum-melted heats were
examined after aging at 650°C. One contained 0.92%
titanium and 2.0% niobium (heat 69-648) and the other
1.3% titanium and 0.60% hafnium (heat 69-641). Both
have only trace levels of silicon, and no MyC was found.
Two MC carbides are present in 69-648 and three in
69-641.

Molybdenum Series. — We have identified the pre-
cipitates formed in Hastelloy N as a function of the
molybdenum concentration. These alloys have silicon

levels of about 0.01%. Only M,C precipitated at 650°C

for molybdenum levels of 10 through 16%. At 19%
molybdenum, the only precipitate formed was a high-
parameter MgC (@ = 11.23 A), probably Ni;Mo,C.

Discussion. — Our observations on the effects of alloy
modifications on the microstructure of the heats
described above are consistent with our previous obser-
vations. The formation of particular types of precipi-
tates is dependent on the alloying additions. The
M,C-type carbide is stable in the basic alloy, with
additions of Ti, Nb, and Hf in sufficient quantities

giving MC-type carbides. The M,C is coarser at 760°C
than at 650°C; however, it is the higher temperature
which is of primary interest to us, since the outlet fuel
salt temperature of an MSBR will be about 700°C. The
postirradiation mechanical properties deteriorate mark-
edly in ‘materials which form coarse M,C at the
irradiation temperature.

The beneficial effect of MC carbides on the postirradi-

ation mechanical properties appears to depend on the
morphology of the precipitate, or at least on the

alloying addition used. Titanium alone in sufficient

quantities improves the postirradiation creep rupture
life, but the fracture ductility may be too low at high

~creep stresses. The most obvious microstructural modi-

fication in the MC-forming titanium-modified alloys is
the formation of massive stacking fault precipitates.

The niobium-modified heats discussed do not contain

sufficient quantities of niobium to stabilize MC. Based
on microstructural observations, we would not expect
these alloys to have good properties after irradiation.
Higher concentrations of niobium would be expected to
exhibit good properties if MC is formed in a desirable
morphology. We will be studying several alloys with
larger niobium additions, particularly alloy 303, which
looks very promising (see Table 18 2).

“Additions of hafnium appear to control the type of
microstructure even with large quantities of titanium
and niobium in the alloy. These alloys are characterized

by small discrete particles in the matrix and grain

boundaries, and the postirradiation mechanical proper-
ties are outstanding.

~ The effect of small quantities of silicon is to cause the _
formation of a silicon-rich stable McC that is very

coarse. This is undesirable in that it results in a grain
boundary structure approaching that of standard Has-
telloy N rather than permitting the generation of a
controlled microstructure by judicious alloying and

~ heat treatment. Thus the electroslag remelt process is

virtually eliminated from further consideration as a
production method for an improved Hastelloy N.

However, small amounts of silicon can likely be

tolerated, particularly when hafnium is present.

18.5 WELDABILITY OF COMMERCIAL ALLOYS
B.McNabb H.E.McCoy

Two of the prime requirements for an alloy to be
used in a nuclear reactor are fabricability and weld-
ability. In scaling up small lab melts to commercial-size
melts, these properties must be evaluated and experi-
ence gained through commercial vendors for promising
alloys. Because of financial restraints our commercial
experience must be limited to small 50- and 100-1b
melts from commercial vendors.

Evaluation of weldability was carried out by making
welds under highly restrained conditions and then using
side bend tests. The weld side bend tests were made
according to ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code
Sect. 9; they used four side bend specimens % in. thick
bent 180° around a % -in, radius. Tensile specimens will
be made from the welds to further evaluate the weld
metal properties.

The four 501b heats from Allvac Metals Company
(69-641, 69-648, 69-714, and 70-727) were received as
1, -in.-thick plates 4 in. wide by 10 in. long in the
rolling direction. Stnps 1, in. square were sawed from
the plates in the rolling direction and swaged to % and
%, in. weld wire. The plates were beveled 50° each,
giving a 100° included angle weld, with a % 4-in. land at .
the root pass. The weld direction was parallel to the
rolling direction in order to get the maximum weld
length, The two 100b heats from the Materials
Systems Division of Union Carbide Corporation
(69-344, 69-345) were % X 9 X 10 in, in the rolling
direction. These plates were prepared as above for the
Allvac heats, except the weld direction was made
perpendicular to the rolling direction so that any
stringers in the base metal would be aligned axially in

the tensile specimens to be cut from the weld and base
metal.
Before welding the plates to each other, they were

welded to a 4-in.-thick steel strongback plate with

provision for inert gas underneath the weld area to
protect the root pass. Tungsten inert gas welding with
argon as the cover gas was used. The root pass was made
with the material initially at room temperature using
%, 2-in. weld wire that had been electrolytically cleaned.
The first four weld passes used %, -in. weld wire, 12'v,
and from 80 to 100 amp. About 25 subsequent weld
passes were made with Y%-in.-diam filler wire at 20 v
and 150 amp with interpass temperatures from 70 to
90°C. '

The chemical composition and relative weldability
rating of each heat are given in Table 18.5. Several
important. observations were made,

1. Heat 69-714 welded the cl,eanést, with no interpass

grinding required to remove any oxide. No flaws

were detected during welding or in the side bend
tests either visually or by dye penetrant inspection.

2. Heat 70-727 welded very clean, with no interpass
- grinding, and no flaws were detected during welding.
There were some very tiny indications of flaws in
the side bend specimens outside the weld and
heat-affected zone in the base metal. There were no

indications in the weld metal or heat-affected zone.

3. Heat 69-344 welded fairly clean, but did requife

some interpass grinding to remove some oxide. -

There were no indications of cracks by visual or dye
penetrant inspection of the weld or the side bend
specimens. e : '

4. Heat 69-648 welded fairly clean, but did reqﬁire

interpass grinding to remove some shallow transverse
cracks noted in passes 8 through 12. These were

easily removed, and visual and dye penetrant inspec-
tion showed no indications of cracks in the final
pass. In the side bend tests, one of the four did show
one tiny indication by dye penetrant, but it was not
found when examined metallographically. The weld
looked good, with no evidence of weld or fusion line
cracking,

5. Heat 69-641 had several small round indications in
weld passes 4, 6, and 12 when dye checked, but they
seemed to be very shallow and easily removed by
rotary file. When the weld side bends were dye
checked, they had from two to five small flaw
indications in each side bend. One of these side bend
specimens was mounted and examined metallograph-
ically. One crack was found in the weld metal
adjacent to some porosity, thus indicating that
porosity could possibly be the cause of the crack
opening up under stress,

6. Heat 69-345 welded very dirty, with dirt floating

out of the weld puddle that had to be ground off
after each pass. There were six small cracks in the
root pass, which were removed by grinding. Three
more ‘passes were put in, and 22 transverse cracks
- were found by dye check. These were removed by
grinding down to the root pass, and four passes were
made with small cracks in them, Then a longitudinal
crack propagated about 5 in. along the weld.
Welding was discontinued and the plate removed
from the strongback plate, ORNL analysis of this
heat indicated about 0.3 wt % zirconium and 0.92
wt % hafnium. Previous experience indicated that
Hastelloy N containing more than 0.05 wt %
zirconium could not be welded successfully.!

18.6 CORROSION STUDIES
J. W. Koger
Temperature, the impurity content of the salt, and

the type of container material are primary variables
which affect corrosion in molten-salt systems. There-

fore, we are studying the effect of these variables on

corrosion and mass transfer in .experimental systems
which are based on design parameters typical of future
moltensalt breeder reactors (MSBR’s). The test facil-
ities include thermal-convection and pumped loop

systems as well as small-scale capsule tests. Most of the
.- work discussed in this section concerns Hastelloy N

alloys of the compositions shown in Table 18.6 and

- molten salts appropriate for single-fluid breeder re-

actors. Of special interest are the corrosion char-
acteristics of the proposed MSBR coolant salt, a

eutectic mixture of sodium ﬂuoroborate and sodium

fluoride. Also, some tests are continuing which contain

‘salts of interest for two-fluid systems, and other tests

include iron-base alloys.

Past work' has shown that, of the major constituents
of Hastelloy N, chromium is much more readily
oxidized by fluoride salts than Fe, Ni, or Mo. Thus
attack is normally manifested by the selective removal
of chromium. The rate-limiting step in chromium

‘removal from the Hastelloy N by fluoride salt corrosion
is the solid-state diffusion of chromium in the alloy. -

Several oxidizing reactions may occur depending on the
salt composition and impurity content, but among the
most important reactants are UF,, FeF,, and HF. In
fluoroborate salt systems, which in some cases have
contained large amounts of H,O and oxygen (>500
ppm), we have found that elements other than chro-

- mium may be oxidized by the salt, and as a result the

Fluoride Systems,” Progr. Nucl. Energy, Ser. IV 2, 164-79

(1960).

corrosion rate is higher and the attack is more uniform.
These cases will be pointed out in the discussion of the
individual systems. The status of the thermal-convec-
tion loops in operation with fluoride salt is summanzed

_in Table 18.7.

18.6.1 Fuel Salts

' Loop 1255, constructed of Hastelloy N and con-
taining a simulated MSRE fuel salt plus 1 mole % ThF,,
continues to operate without difficulty after 7.9 years.
- .Loop 1258, constructed of type 304L stainless steel
and containing removable insert specimens in the hot
leg, has operated about 6.6 years with the same salt as
loop 1255. A plot of the weight change of the
specimens in the hot leg as a function of operating time
at various temperatures is given in Fig. 18.13. The
corrosion rate at the highest temperature; 688°C,
assuming uniform wall removal, has averaged 1.1
mils/year and is continually decreasing. Even though
the weight losses are relatively large, there has been no
indication of plugging.

Because of interest in iron-base alloys W1th lower
chromium contents for possible containment of molten
salts, a maraging steel (12 Ni—5 Cr—3 Mo~bal Fe)
specimen has been exposed to salt in loop 1258. Table

- '18.8 gives a comparison of the weight losses and

corrosion rates of several alloys, including the maraging
steel, under similar exposure conditions. As expected,
because of the lower chromium content, the maraging
steel shows better corrosion resistance than the stainless
steels, but the corrosion behavior of the Hastelloy N is
still superior to both. The test is contmumg, and other
‘iron-base alloys will be tested.

Loop NCL-16, constructed of standard Hastelloy N
with removable specimens in each leg, has operated
with the two-fluid MSBR fuel salt for over 17,800 hr.
The corrosion rate at the highest temperature, 704°C,
in NCL-16 assuming uniform attack is 0.04 mil/year.
For this system, as with all others studied to date,
titanium-modified Hastelloy N specimens continue to
have smaller weight changes than standard Hastelloy N
specimens under equivalent conditions. This has been

'generally attributet_l to the absence of iron in the-

modified alloys. The chromium content of the salt,

“glazed” with a coating that is impossible to remove
without damaging the metal. This has made weight
change measurements difficult; however, there has been
little change in the chromium concentration of the salt.

18.6.4 Coolant Salt

- Loop N_CL-13A,.constructed of standard Hastelloy'N
- with removable specimens in each leg, has operated for

11,800 hr with the fluoroborate salt proposed as the
MSBR secondary coolant. Figure 18.14 gives the weight

changes of specimens at various temperatures as a

currently 400 ppm, continues to show a small increase -

with time, while the iron content has apparently

- stabijlized. Earlier the FeF, content in the salt had

decreased, suggesting that the reaction
FeF, (d) + Cr(s) = CrF, (d) + Fe (deposited) ,
where

d = dissolved in salt,
s =solid solution,

was responsible for part of the mass transfer. Since no

changes in FeF, are now seen, the UF, corrosion
reaction must now be the primary cause for the
chromium removal. The overall process is still con-
trolled by solid-state diffusion of chromium in the
alloy. ' :

18.6.2 FertileFissile Salt

Loop ‘NCL-18, constructed of standard Hastelloy N
with removable specimens in each leg, has operated

. with the single-fluid MSBR salt for over 11,600 hr. The

weight change at the highest temperature, 704°C, is

—1.1 mg/cm?. Assuming uniform attack, the corrosion -

rate is 0.05 mil/year. The titanium-modified Hastelloy N
specimens show smaller weight losses than standard
specimens in equivalent positions, and, as'in the case of

function of operating time. This figure is typical of the

plots of total weight change of the specimens vs time
that we obtain from all the natural-circulation loops. It
is clear that material is removed in the hot sections and
deposited in the cold sections. It is also obvious that
these changes are temperature dependent and that the
corrosion and deposition rates decrease with time. The
corrosion rate at the maximum temperature, 605°C, is
0.6 mil/year. The attack in this case may involve other
alloy constituents besides chromium, since analyses of

~ the salt show approximately 1000 ppm water and 1000

ppm oxygen. Large amounts of these impurities
portend high corrosion rates due to the formation of
strong oxidants such as HF. The chromium concentra-’
tion of the salt initially was 253 ppm and has remained
near that value throughout operation.

Loop NCL-14, constructed of standard Hastelloy N
with removable specimens in each leg, has operated for
20,300 hr with the fluoroborate coolant salt. The
weight changes of the specimens at the various tempera-
tures as a function of operating time are given in Fig.
18.15. Two changes of corrosion rate are noted in the
plot. These changes were traced to a defective gas line

because of impurity-controlled attack, the corrosion is

generally uniform. It appears that under extreme

oxidizing conditions when all constituents of the alloy

are removed, the nickel and molybdenum that are

removed as fluorides deposit as metals in the cold
portion of the loop. Larger amounts of chromium and
iron fluorides remain in the salt. After the extreme
oxidizing conditions pass, the iron fluorides oxidize

‘more chromium from the alloy. It is encouraging that,

in spite of two known problems which increased the

corrosion rate, loop NCL-14 has operated for over two

years with the fluoroborate salt and that the incre-
mental corrosion rate is currently less than 0.5 mil/year.

Loop NCL-17, constructed of standard Hastelloy N
with removable specimens in each leg, is being operated
to determine the effect of steam inleakage in a flowing

fluoroborate salt—Hastelloy N system. This experiment

has run for over 5900 hr and is continuing in order to

provide information on the immediate and long-range
corrosion of the system after steam injection. The loop

was operated for 1000 hr, the specimens removed and
weighed, and steam forced into the flowing salt system
through a 16-mil hole in a closed Y -n. Hastelloy N
tube, simulating a leaking heat exchanger. Steam was
forced into the system until the pressure began to

increase, thus indicating that no more steam was soluble

in the salt. - | _
Table 189 summarizes the results to date. The
corrosion rate continues to decrease with time, and the

incremental .rates have now fallen to 1 mil/year. Figure

18.16 shows the weight changes and temperatures for

“the specimens in NCL-17. As usual, the changes are

temperature dependent, and the rates are decreasing
with time. Figure 18.17 shows micrographs of the
specimens in the hottest and coldest positions. The

attack seen in Fig, 18.17a is general, as expected for
impurity-controlled mass transfer processes. Micrometer
measurements show a loss of approximately 1 mil from
specimen surfaces at the maximum temperature posi-
tion. In Fig. 18.17b we see a large amount (~2 mils) of
deposited material. This material has been analyzed
using an electron beam microprobe, and Table 18.10
gives the results for the matrix and the deposit. These
results show that very little chromium has deposited.
The nickel and molybdenun concentrations had reached

~a maximum of 74 and 56 ppm, respectively, 288 hr
- after the steam addition, decreased, and quickly leveled

off to about 10 ppm each. From the microprobe

~evidence much of the nickel and molybdenum ap-

parently has deposited in the cold leg, although not in
the same ratio as they exist in Hastelloy N. A similar

~ deposition was also found and discussed for NCL-14.

One may conclude that under highly oxidizing condi-
tions where large weight changes occur (NCL-14 during
the air leak and NCL-17 after steam inleakage), most of

the changes are attributable to the movement of the
normally stable nickel and molybdenum. Any increased
chromium removal from the hot leg is noted just as an
increase in the chromium concentration in the salt. The

‘phosphorus found in the deposit was apparently from a

phosphate impurity in the steam. For the last 2500 hr

the concentrations of impurity constituents in the salt,.

Fe, Cr, Ni, Mo, H, 0, and O, , have remained fairly con-

stant. The present chromium level is 320 ppm. The con-

tinuing results of this test are quite significant in that

~ we have shown that the fluoroborate salt and the Hastel-

loy N can withstand an accidental steam inleakage con-
dition and that a system consisting of these components
could continue to operate without extensive damage
even if the salt were not repurified.

Loop NCL-20, constructed of standard Hastelloy N

‘with removable specimens in each leg, has circulated a

fluoroborate coolant salt for 1700 hr and is being

operated at temperature conditions very near those
- proposed for the maximum (687°C) and minimum

(387°C) salt-metal temperature (primary heat ex-

changer and steam generator respectively) of the MSBR

secondary circuit. Forced air cooling (as opposed to

- ambient air cooling used on other thermal-convection
loops) is used on the lower half of the cold leg, and the-

practical operating temperatures obtained were 687°C
maximum and ~438°C minimum: a AT of 250°C. This
AT is thought to be the largest obtained at ORNL in a
molten-salt thermal-convection loop, and the maximum
temperature is the highest for fluoroborate salt in a

- loop. The weight change of the specimen at the highest

temperature was —0.3 mg/cm? (0.15 mil /year assuming
uniform attack) after 700 hr. Salt analyses showed an

-increase in chromium content of 30 ppm and an H,0

content of 550 ppm.

'Mention was made in the last semiannual mport4 of

capsule experiments designed to determine the uptake
of chromium from standard Hastelloy N into relatively
pure NaBF;-NaF (92-8 mole %) containing approxi-
mately 400. ppm each oxygen and water at 427°C

(800°F), 538°C (1000°F), 649°C (1200°F), and 760°C

(1400°F). Tests were conducted for 1200 hr, after
which the salt was analyzed for chromium and other
impurities. Figure 18.18 shows the logarithmic variation
of chromium content as a function of the reciprocal of
the absolute test temperature. The iron concentration
was originally about 200 ppm and decreased by an
amount proportional to the increase in chromium. The
final iron content of the salt at the highest temperature

(760°C) was 60 ppm.

An Arrhenius-type relationship appears to hold be-

tween 538 and 760°C. This would be expected if the -

 18.6.5 Summary of Corrosion Studies

This section will act as a summary of the current
developments involving the compatibility of fused salts
and Hastelloy N. Table 18.11 compares the corrosion
rates of standard Hastelloy N in tests of 5000 hr or
longer involving several fluoride salts.

Except for certain of the fluoroborate tests the
overall corrosion rates have been relatively small.
Thermal-convection loop NCL-14 has operated success-
fully for over two years and the pump loop MSR-FCL-1

 

247

nearly one year with the fluoroborate mixture. Compar- '

ison of the rates experienced by NCL-13A, NCL-14, and
MSR-FCL-1, all circulating the sodium fluoroborate
mixture, indicates a velocity effect on the mass transfer.
We believe that the effect of velocity on corrosion in
this system is a function of declining importance as the
purity level of the salt improves. The impurity effect
per se has been discussed in detail previously. Because
of the importance of the impurities on the corrosion of
Hastelloy N by fluoroborate, efforts have begun on
methods of purifying the salt. Also to be considered are
better methods for analyzing and identifying the
impurities. At some purity level, perhaps 200 to 400
ppm water andfor oxygen, as analyzed, solid-state

diffusion of chromium in the Hastelloy N will likely

- control corrosmn as it does in the fuel salts This is

most important, since it suggests that an entire MSBR
of either the one- or two-fluid variety can be operated
with none of the main circulating channels suffering
more than a few tenths of a mil per year corrosion
attack. Experimental proof of this is one of our major
near-term goals,

18.7 FLUOROBORATE PURITY TEST
J.W.Koger R.F. Apple

Attempts to purify the NaBF,4-NaF (92-8%) coolant
salt have continued. A schematic of the process is given
in Fig. 18.19. A mixture of BF;, He, and heated HF
was passed into a Hastelloy N vessel containing the
impure (~2000 ppm H, O) fluoroborate salt (2.7 kg) at
480°C for 15 hr. The exit gas entered a 90 vol % methyl
alcohol—10 vol % pyridine solution, where the mixture
was titrated with Karl Fischer reagent to the dead stop
end point. The titration indicated that about 600 ppm
H, O was removed. Chemical analysis disclosed that the
O, content decreased from 1700 to 1400 ppm and that
the H,O content changed from 2000 to 300 ppm.
Changes in the BF; content of the salt appeared to be
minimal. Further work is planned using a nickel vessel
to eliminate corrosion products resulting from the
reaction of HF with Hastelloy N. '

The third 2000-hr run (total accumulated time of
6098 hr at design conditions) was completed on
October - 22, 1969, and corrosion specimens were

~ removed for metallographic examination and weight

change measurement. Test specimens were reinstalled in
the loop, and on November 23, 1969, operation was
started on the fourth run. As of February 28, 1970, the
loop had accumulated 8100 hr of operation at design’
conditions. Salt samples have been taken for chemical
analysis about every 500 hr.

18.8.1 Metallurgical Analysis
Wéight Changes. — Table 18.12 details weight -changes

of the standard Hastelloy N specimens in the loop and

the changes in concentration of the metallic impurities

‘in the salt during the operating life of the loop. It is

apparent from the weight changes that the corrosion
rate is decreasing and now averages about 1.2 mils/year
at the hottest position, assuming uniform attack. This

rate is higher than that obtamed in thermal—convection
loops under similar conditions; the apparent effect of
velocity on corrosion strongly suggests that corrosion
processes are occurring other than the selective removal
of chromium and iron.

Salt Chemistry. — The data in Table 18. 12 show that

“there was a large increase in chromium fluoride com-

pound (corrosion product) in the salt during the first
operating period with little subsequent increase. During

.each period the iron fluoride has decreased. This leads

one to beheve that the reactlon
Cr(s) + FeF,(d) = CrF,(d) + Fe(deposited) ,

where
s = sblid solution,
d = dissolved in salt,

is responsible for a portion of the corrosion. The salt
contained a large amount of iron fluoride at the
beginning (407 ppm), and each time the salt is dumped

back into the fill tank with the residual salt it picks up
more iron fluoride. The results of the oxygen and water

analyses have been quite scattered, with the values

around 1000 ppm for each. These fairly high numbers

and the velocity effect indicate that impurities such as

HF also play a large part in the corrosion. With no
increase of corrosion products in the salt at the present

time, all the material removed in the hot section is
deposmng in the cold section. Evidence at the present

‘shows that the deposit is metallic and adherent on the

metal surface and is not in the form to cause plugging
very rapidly.

graphs of specimens from several locations in

salt at 588 and 555°C respectwely The uniform attack
is seen on both specimens, with the rougher surface
seen on the iugher-temperature sample shown in Fig.
18.20. In Fig. 18.22 the mounting material removed
some of the deposit, but portions can still be seen.

Pump Deposits. — Visual examination of the pump
and pump bowl after over 6000 hr of operation showed

no obvious corrosion. None of the green Na3CrFg
corrosion product that had been observed previously
was present. o

~Cold Finger.. — During the present run a cold finger
corrosion product trap, similar in design to one pre-
viously used in sodium fluoroborate test loop PKP-1, 1

was inserted into the salt in the pump bowl in an

attempt to induce preferentlal deposmon of corrosion
products from the salt circulating in the loop. Such pref-
erential deposition was observed on the cold finger in-
serted into the pump bowl of loop PKP-1. !

The cold finger used in MSR-FCL-! is a closed-end
nickel cylinder, 1% in. long, % in. OD, with a

0.070-in.-thick wall. Cooling is by means of an argon-

water mixture injected into the cylinder ID and then
discharged to the atmosphere. The metal wall tempera-
ture is.measured and recorded by two 0.020-in.-OD
sheathed, ungrounded Chromel-Alumel thermocouples
inserted in two 1-in.-deep axial holes (0.023 in. diam) in
the 0.070-in.-thick wall of the cold finger.

Eight tests were made in which the cold finger was
inserted into the salt in the pump bowl of test loop
MSR-FCL-1 and cooled to temperatures (as indicated
by the thermocouples in the wall of the cold finger)
ranging from 493 to 140°C. The duration of the tests
ranged from 1.5 to 5.3 hr. The temperature of the salt
in the pump bowl was 510°C.

In contrast to the deposits of material containing
Na, CrF which were found on a cold finger in PKP-1
loop at metal wall temperatures of 400, 460, and 477°C
(ref. 2), no significant deposit of any kind was seen on
the cold finger tests in loop MSR-FCL-1. Even in the
three tests where indicated wall temperatures were
below the salt liquidus temperature (385°C), the
surface. of the cold finger was essentially clean as
visually observed when withdrawn into a sight glass.

The cold finger was then mstalled in the PKP-l
fluoroborate loop in an attempt to duplicate the
previous cold finger test results of this loop. The
chromium concentration of the fluoroborate salt in
loop PKP-1 is about 500 ppm, while that in MSR-FCL-1
is about 250 ppm. Two tests were run in which the
indicated cold finger wall temperature was about 150°C

(salt temperature in the pump bowl was 548°C). Test

times weré 1 and 4.5 hr. No deposition on the cold

at ‘higher temperatures were not made because of
temperature control difficulties with the cold finger.
Since the cold finger previously used in the PKP-1
loop contamed grooves on the outside surface, the

Work is in progress on a second molten-salt forced-
circulation loop, designated MSR-FCL-2, which is to be

~used to study the corrosion resistance of Hastelloy N
and the mass transfer properties of Hastelloy N and

fluoroborate-type coolant salt systems at conditions
proposed for the MSBR. Other salts proposed for the

‘MSBR could also be circulated in the loop if desired.

The loop design is generally similar to the presently
operating - forced-circulation corrosion-test loop,3

signed for variable salt flow rates up to 30 gpm and
heads to 300 ft will be used to provide increased salt

the loop design include: (1) three corrosion specimen
assemblies designed for easy installation and removal

without draining salt from the loop, (2) two in-
dependently controlled heated sections for flexibility in
~controlling the salt temperature at each of the three

corrosion specimen assemblies, (3) provisions for de-

sections, (4) bulk fluid AT to 165°C, which requires
~125 kw at the expected flow rate of ~4 gpm, and (5)
an auxiliary expansion tank to allow for expansion of
the salt and to provide space for salt sampling, liquid
level indicating probes, installation of a “cold finger”

~ 18.9 CORROSION OF HASTELLOY N
| IN STEAM

B.McNabb H.E.McCoy

Specimens were removed from the Bull Run Cor-
rosion Facility? on January 12, 1970, after 2000 hr in a
steam environment at 3500 psi and 538°C. Weight gains
were about 0.1 to 0.4 mg/cm? (0.04 to 0.14 mil/year
assuming uniform corrosion) for all compositions of
standard and modified Hastelloy N. The oxide films
were adherent, with no sign of spalling. The specimens
were removed for weighing at 372, 1000, and 2000 hr.
The oxidation rates appear to be linear after the
initially faster rate up to 372 hr. The same trends are
continuing that were observed at the first removal. We
observed that surface treatment has an effect on the
weight gains of the specimens. After 2000 hr, surface-
ground specimens (400-grit paper) had the largest
weight gains of 04 mg/cm?, as-received gained 0.2
mgfcm?, and electropolished specimens gained 0.1
mgfcm?. Most of the specimens were returned for
further exposure, but some were removed for detalled
examination and testing.

~ Some chromlum steels were also mcluded in the
facility for comparison. The oxidation rates of the

steels were much higher than Hastelloy N, having
weight gains from 3 to 6 mg/cm? for 1000 hr exposure
to the same environment. These steels contained from
1.1 to 8.7% chromium and ~1% molybdenum. As

‘shown in Fig. 18.23, the oxidation rates of these steels

varied by a factor of only 2 in the steam environment at

19. Support for Chemical Processing |

J. R. DiStefano

Chemical processes for the isolation of protactinium
and the removal of fission products from molten salts
impose severe limitations on containment materials,
Compatibility with liquid bismuth and molten salt fuels

at 650°C is required, but conventional nickel- and

iron-base alloys are -not satisfactory because of their

- susceptibility to dissolution and mass transfer in

bismuth. The most promising materials appear to be
molybdenum, tungsten, rhenium, tantalum, and
graphite. Of these, molybdenum, tungsten, rhenium,
and graphite are difficult to fabricate into complex
shapes, and tantalum has a high reactivity with environ-
ments other than ultrahigh vacua. In addition we must
consider the possible effects of lithium or thorium in
bismuth and a high fluoride ion concentration in the
molten salt on compatibility. With these factors in mind
we have concluded that molybdenum has the highest
probability for success in this application. Accordingly,

DIE BACKER

 

our program has focused on those problem areas that
appear most difficult: fabrication and joining. In
addition we are continuing to evaluate the compati-
bility of molybdenum and other potential materials
with bismuth as well as methods of coating conven-

‘tional iron- or nickel-base alloys with tungsten or

molybdenum to protect them from bismuth.

19.1 FABRICATION DEVELOPMENT

One such process is back extrusion, which involves
the flow of metal into a die and extrusion back over an
advancing plunger. A cross section of the tooling and its
placement in the existing container sleeve of our
extrusion press is shown in Fig. 19.1. The advantages of
this process are that the final diameter is as large as or
larger than the starting blank, the geometry can be
changed by relatively simple changes in die and mandrel
design, and deformation can be accomplished below the
recrystallization temperature so that a wrought struc-
ture having good mechanical properties is produced.

We have recently utilized this technique to fabricate
containers having hemispherical ends with bosses for
joining. We produced three arc-melted-molybdenum
capsules having a single %-in.-diam boss and 2.5 in. in
diameter by 0.25 in. wall thickness by back extrusion at

'1200°C. A cross-sectional and an end view of two of

these capsules are shown in Fig. 19.2. The surface
finishes and metal flow patterns were excellent. The

 

microstructure and weldmg properties of these capsules
are currently being evaluated.

We are also designing tooling to produce larger-
diameter capsules having the geometry of bosses needed
for the container shown in Fig. 19.3. The advantages of
this geometry are that containers and connecting tubing

~ can be fabricated more easily with butt joints by

welding or with mechanical joints where necessary.

A fillet weld was first made using low-carbon molyb-
denum wire filler metal, followed by the fusion welds
with no filler metal. The atmosphere in the dry box
during welding (using electrolytic monitors) was 8 ppm
H,0 and 9 ppm O,. The welds were clean and bright,
and no cracks were visible in the weld faces when they
were dye-penetrant inspected. The helium leak rate of
each weld was less than 1 X 107 atm cm® sec™?.

Two procedures are being considered for field welding
of molybdenum tubing. First, we are evaluating a
commercially available orbiting-arc torch. This device
has two main drawbacks: (1) it has a Teflon inner sleeve
which can become overheated due to its proximity to
the weld joint and the relatively high thermal conduc-
tivity of molybdenum, and (2) the gap between the

‘tube and the welder head is relatively large, which could

allow contamination to occur during welding. To
overcome these difficulties, our second approach is to

- design and build a prototype clamshell vacuum chamber

are being evaluated as joining techniques for the -

fabrication of this system.
Several typical weld joints that would likely be used

- in fabricating the loop are shown in Fig. 19.3. The use

of back-extruded dished heads with integral protrusions
allows us to butt weld the connecting lines. However, in
some locations a fillet weld will be requlred where a

tube protrudes into the pot.

Both shop (glove box) and field weldmg of molyb-
denum are being investigated. Glove-box welds can be

- made by either manual or automatic gas tungsten-arc
processes. To investigate manual welding, several flat

tube-to-header disks of low-carbon, low-oxygen molyb-
denum were manually welded by gas tungsten-arc in an
argon-filled chamber to develop parameters, joint

~ designs, cleaning procedures, and atmosphere require-

ments. One of these disks is shown in Fig. 19.4.

Prior to welding, all components were degreased with
acetone and -then chenucally cleaned using the follow-
ing procedure:

with O-ring seals. If this' chamber can be adequately
evacuated and backfilled with an inert gas while around
a tube, we will then begm desxgmng an orbltmg-arc
torch to fit inside.

Since ' large-grained recrystallized molybdenum is less

developing corrosion-resistant alloys that flow below

effectively brazed molybdenum and its alloys in.the
desired temperature range of 1050 to 1350°C.! How-
ever, the Fe—C—B: alloy was attacked by bismuth
except in those areas enriched in molybdenum as a

result of diffusion of the base metal during brazing.

Therefore, we prepared several experimental iron-base
alloys with additions of molybdenum that would not
significantly raise their melting points. Several of these
compositions were then used to successfully braze
molybdenum without causing recrystallization during
the brazing cycle. Figure 19.5 shows. the excellent
wettability and flowability of two of these braze alloys.

Three brazing alloys were corrosion tested in 600°C
bismuth for 700 hr. Chemical analysis revealed a small
(5 ppm) pickup of iron by the bismuth. By changing
the design to a lap joint we found that corrosion of the
Fe—C—B brazing alloy, which was tested previously as a
T+oint, was less severe, as shown in Fig. 19.6. Further-
more, the addition of molybdenum to the Fe—C—B

alloys definitely improved their corrosion resistance, as
seen in Fig. 19.7. Some attack occurred along the fillet; .

however, in another sample little or no corrosion

occurred in the ¢apillary part of the braze (that area
sandwiched by the molybdenum base metal but highly
enriched in molybdenum by dissolution and diffusion).
. We found cracking and lamination of the base metal
(Fig. 19.6) in many of the brazed joints in which
commercial powder metallurgically produced molyb-
denum was used. We believe that the cracks were caused
by cutting, machining, and other handling operations.
Since the cracks extended through the frozen bismuth,
they probably occurred after test. Subsequent tests will
be conducted on low-carbon, low-oxygen arc-cast
molybdenum, which appears to have better fabricability
than the molybdenum we have previously tested.

' 19.4 COMPATIBILITY OF STRUCTURAL
MATERIALS WITH BISMUTH

The bismuth used in these tests was grade 69 obtained
from Cominco American,: Oxygen contamination in the

‘bismuth resulted in reactions tliat caused the formation

of a plug in the first.two loops; but this problem was
eliminated in subsequent tests by bubbling hydrogen
through ‘the molten metal for 2 hr at 350°C and
filtering - through a 10 type 304 stainless steel filter
prior to loading into the loop.

One of the most promising materials appears to be

molybdenum, Loop 3 contained two tensile samples of

~molybdenum and one molybdenum and one TZM

(M0-0.5% Ti—0.1% Zr) tubular sample in each of the

L

reduction in thickness was detected, " and the weight

. changes were within experimental error. Specttographic

analysis of the bismuth before and after test showed an
increase in molybdenum concentratlon of only 0.3
ppm.

Loop 4 contained niobium and Nb-—l% Zr samples
and was operated at 705°C with a AT of 75 + 5°C for a
period of only 115 hr before plugging occurred. The

- effect of bismuth on these samples at this temperature

high- and low-temperature regions. After 3000 hr of -

scheduled operation at a maximum temperature of
700°C and a AT of 95 * 5°C, we found very little
reaction between molybdenum or TZM and the molten
bismuth. In fact it did not appear that the bismuth wet

‘the metal surfaces very well. Figure 19.8 shows the

appearance of the samples before and after test. No

was catastrophic, as indicated by Fig. 19.9. The
thickness of the tensile samples was reduced from
0.0195 in. to 0.013 in., indicating dissolution by the
bismuth, X-ray diffraction analysis of a sample taken
from the plug showed the presence of several phases:

- one had the same structure and lattice parameter as

high-purity bismuth, and one was identified as alpha-
zirconium, There were also four weak unexplained

-diffraction maxima. None of the diffraction lmes could
be attributed .to a niobium type of crystal structure.

However, since the atomic radius of niobium is the
same as that of bismuth, it could occupy substitutional
lattice sites in the bismuth unit cell without affecting
the lattice parameter. A semiquantitaﬁve spectrographic
analysis of the plug indicated that in-addition to
bismuth it contained 0.5% Nb, 100 ppm Zr, 300 ppm
Cr and Ni,-and 500 ppm Fe. The chromium, nickel, and
jiron undoubtedly were picked up during filtering of the
bismuth through a stainless steel filter prior to test.

In the future we plan to determine the compatibility
of other potential container materials such as tantalum
and graphite with molten bismuth. In addition we will
also evaluate the effect on compatibility of other
metallic ions such as lithium or thorium in the bismuth.

19.5 CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITED COATINGS
L.E.Poteat J.I. Federer

. Application and evaluation of tungsten coatings on
materials for fuel processing requirements have con-

tinued. Tungsten, which has good corrosion resistance
to liquid bismuth, is applied by hydrogen reduction of
WF¢ at 500 and 600°C. Coatings measuring 0,005 to
0.009 in. thick were deposited on the materials shown
in Table 19.1, Initially we believed that the degree of
adherence of the coatings was associated with the
difference in coefficient of expansion between tungsten
and the substrate, However, our recent work has shown
that the composition of the substrate determines the
degree of adherence. Differences in thermal expansion,
on the other hand, may influence the service life of the
coating, . L

A qualitative assessment of the adherence of the
tungsten coating to the materials in Table 19.1 was
made immediately after coating. We observed that the
coatings cracked and spalled from the steel and stainless
steel specimens upon cooling from the deposition
temperature, but remained intact on iron-nickel alloys,
“A” nickel, Hastelloy C, and Inconel 600. The non-
adherence of tungsten coatings to steel or stainless

_steels is attributed to the formation of stable iron

andfor chromium fluorides on the surface by reaction

.with WF4. These fluorides are neither volatile nor

reducible by hydrogen at 600°C. We know that the
tendency for nickel to react with WFs to form a
fluoride is much less than for iron and chromium, and a
continuous fluoride film probably does not form on the
surfaces of iron-nickel and nickel-base alloys. Utilizing
this information we obtained adherent tungsten coat-

“ings on stainless steels by first applying a thin nickel

plate by electrodeposition. It was necessary to bond the
nickel plate to the stainless steel by annealing at 800°C
prior to deposition of tungsten; otherwise the tungsten
coating would not adhere. Typical specimens are shown
in Fig. 19.10. Note that the coating cracked and
separated from a plain type 430 stainless steel speci-
men, but was intact on either a nickel-plated type 430
specimen or an Inconel 600 specimen.

The adherence of the coatings to sheet-type speci-
mens was further evaluated by thermal cycling, spiral

| ~ bend testing, and tensile testing. We found the coatings -

uncracked and intact on the iron-nickel alloys, “A”
nickel, Hastelloy C, and Inconel 600 after 15 cycles
between 25 and 600°C. Types 405, 430, and 446
stainless steel specimens which had not been nickel
plated prior-to tungsten coating were also tested, but
the coating cracked and spalled from types 430 and 446
after four cycles and began to separate from type 405
after 15 cycles.

In the spiral bend test at 25°C, specimens are
manually bent around the jig shown in Fig. 19.11.!
Bent specimens of types 304 and 430 stainless steel

‘(nickel plated before coating), Hastelloy C, and Inconel

600 are shown in Fig. 19.12. The stainless steel
specimens were about 0,025 in. thick and the other two
specimens were about 0.063 in. thick prior to coating.
Each specimen was bent to a radius of curvature of 1 in.
or less, and different amounts of springback determine -
the final shape of the specimens. Although the tungsten
coatings cracked, they did not spall from any of the
specimens. _

Tensile testing of the coatmg utilizes the specunen

- arrangement shown in Fig. 19.13. The coated specimens

are brazed to the ends of steel bars, which are pulled in
a tensile machine. Tensile adherence strengths greater

"than 16,000 psi have been measured for coatings on

Inconel 600. Coatings on stainless steel are expected to
have similar strengths, but they have not yet been
evaluated,

Coating of substrates with molybdenum by hydrogen
reduction of MoF¢ has begun. This process requires
temperatures of approximately 800°C or higher. At
lower temperatures an impure, noncoherent deposit
occurs. One experimental disadvantage of higher deposi-
tion temperatures is that the vessel to be coated must
be strong enough to withstand a differential pressure of
about 1 atm at temperature, since pressures less than 10

torrs are required to produce a deposit of uniform

thickness. A second disadvantage could result from =
reaction of molybdenum with the substrate material.
Although both tungsten and molybdenum form binary
alloys with iron, chromium, and nickel, molybdenum
would be expected to alloy more readily with these

‘elements, especially at the higher deposition tempera-

tures that are needed. Molybdenum can form inter-

metallic compounds with iron and nickel, and this
could decrease . the adhesion of coatings. However,
preliminary investigation has ‘indicated that molyb-

‘denum coatings are more ductile than tungsten coatings

and, therefore, should be less likely to crack during
thermal cycling.

ture range for protection of steels from oxidation were
compared. These were Markal CR-9 (Markal Company,
Chicago, Illinois), Speco H-170, a silicone-base alu-
minum paint, Speco H-170, a silicone-base zinc paint

(Speco Inc., Cleveland, Ohio), a silicone-base aluminum

paint (unknown vendor), and as-received tubing with no
coating (designated M Cr-9, SPE AL, SPE ZN, SIL Al,
and AS REC respectively). The specimens coated were
1-in.-long, 0.375-in.-diam tubes with 0.058 in. wall

 thickness. They were first cleaned in acetone and then

the coatings applied by dipping and air drying 16 hr.
They were then heated in an air furnace for 1000 hr at

" 650°C, cycling to 25°C every 25 hr. |
Results are summarized in Fig. 19.14, The as-received

specimen gained weight until the oxide layer spalled
after about 400 hr. A net weight loss was measured
after 600 hr, but then after that time the specimen
started to gain weight again. The specimen coated with

* Markal CR-9 initially lost weight, presumably due to a
loss of volatile elements in the coating, then gradually’

gained weight until after 1000 hr it had the smallest
weight change of all. The specimens coated with the
siticone-base aluminum and zinc paints gained weight at
approximately the same rate as the as-received speci-
men, but they did not spall upon cooling and, there-
fore, had the largest weight gains after 1000 hr. The
remaining unaffected metal (wall thickness) in the
various specimens was M CR-9, 0.049 in.; SPE AL,
0.041 in., SPE ZN, 0.038 in.; SIL AL, 0.037 in.; and AS
REC, 0.035 in. This value was inversely related to the
observed weight increase except for the as-received
specimen, where spalling occurred.

bismuth in a fuel processing vessel might be to use

20. Support for Components Development Program

H.E. McCoy

The culmination of a development program is to use
the basic information that has been developed to

power plant will require pumps, heat exchangers, steam
generators, and numerous other components. At this
stage of development, work on components is not
receiving a high priority. However, certain basic capa-
bilities are needed to proceed with building components
when this part of the program is reached. One of these
areas involves the ability to make remote cuts and welds

‘construct an operating engineering system. A nuclear .

Figure 20.1 (composite) shows a cross section and
photomicrograph of a root pass in Hastelloy N piping.
The weld is extremely sound and free from any type of
microfissuring. Figure 20.2 shows the general ap-
pearance of welds in 6-in.-diam pipe after the root pass
(left) and completion of filler passes (right).

A major problem in remote maintenance of an MSBR

~ or any reactor is that of obtaining correct alignment

for maintenance purposes. Our involvement in this
program has been primarily with the choice of welding

configurations and parameters. A second area of work
concerns the development of a bearing to operate in

molten salts. Our present concepts of fuel and coolant

pumps do not require such a bearing, but .small
auxiliary pumps may be desired that utilize such a
bearing. A bearing for this operation must be a cermet
(ceramic-metal composition). This cermet can be solid

or simply a coating on a metal. Our current work

involves the evaluation of four cermet coatings that -

were applied by plasma spraying. A third area is
involved with assuring adequate instrumentation for
operating a nuclear plant. The examination of a
pressure-measuring device in a sodium fluoroborate
loop has led to a better appreciation of the quahty
control needed for such de\nces

and fitup of mating components. If very accurate

alignment is not a necessity, the design criteria for pipe
aligning mechanisms can be simplified. We are determin-
ing the amount of mismatch which will be permissible,
and Fig. 20.3 shows a cross section of a successful pipe
weld which was misaligned by about % ¢ in. The
adaptability of the equipment to this condition is
excellent.

We are also improving the welding torch for this
equipment, and an automatic self-adapting arclength
control has been developed. This is in preliminary
checkout evaluation and looks very promising.

postulated that this was discovered by ORNL personnel

after purchase, and that a repair was attempted by back
brazing from inside the tube. Pieces of suspected
brazing alloy were removed from inside the tube and
analyzed. The compositions of the remaining braze
alloy and the Inconel are given in Table 20.1. This

brazing alloy was much less compatible with the fused
salt than Inconel due to the presence of B and higher Cr
and Fe concentrations. Thus we believe that corrosion
was the cause of failure.

_Figure 20.4 shows the failed pipe section in both the
as-polished and etched conditions. The porosity of the
braze material is evident in Fig. 20.4a. The weld metal

Another PMD, bought at the same time, was cut apart

brazing operation was an isolated repair. We have

~ recommended, however, that all PMD’s purchased on

the same order and serving in critical facilities be tested
by radiographic methods to determine their condition.

Effect of Applied Electric Current on Corrosion in

Fluoroborate Salt. — Four liquid level induction probes
exposed to salt in the Inconel PKP-1 loop were
examined in order to evaluate the effect of excitation
current on fluoroborate corrosion. Two of the probes
were sheathed with Hastelloy N and two with stainless
steel. The compositions of the respective alloys are
given in Table 20.2. The stainless steel probes were

exposed for 72 hr and the Hastelloy N probes for 60
days. For each material, one probe served as a control,
no current imposed, while the other saw 1000 Hz 0.04
v rms and 0.1 amp. The salt temperature in all cases was
550°C. The results of the tests are summarized in Table
20.3. : '
The visual appearance of the probes after test is
compared in Fig. 20.7. The two stainless steel probes
. showed heavy attack and were noticeably discolored.
The corrosion rate of the stainless steel averaged 0.1
mil/hr. Hastelloy N showed no visible attack, but
measurements of the wall thickness of the sheath
indicated a corrosion rate of 7 X 10™* mil/hr.

Wall thickness changes (Table 20.3) and metal-
lographic examination both indicated that the excita-
tion current had a small effect on Hastelloy N corro-
sion, although precise measurements in a more highly
controlled environment are necessary to confirm this
behavior, Such an effect was not noted for the stainless
steel probes, which suffered 143 times the corrosion
loss of the Hastelloy. The heavy attack of the stainless
steel probes in this test paralleled that which led to

quired to determine their overall potential. These and
improved coatings (such as being oxide free) must be
thoroughly examined on the basis of microstructure,
development of improved better NDT evaluations,
thermal cycling resistance, heat treating (which is
normally higher than the 700°C maximum operating
temperatures), compatibility in molten fluoride salts,
design, and bearing tests in molten salt, involving
boundary (rubbing) and hydrodynamic lubrication
tests.

Part 6. Molten-Salt Processing and Preparation

Part 6 deals with the development of processes for the
isolation of protactinium and the removal of fission
products from molten-=salt reactors. This reporting
period has seen a significant revision in the conceptual
flowsheets that form the basis for our development
effort. The reductive extraction scheme for the removal
of rare earths from the reactor fuel salt was the weak

required exploitation of separation factors between
thorium and the rare earths in the range of 1.2 to 3.5 in
the fluoride-salt—bismuth system. The large electrolyzer
for generating the extractant was required to operate in
an undesirable mode, with very low flows of electrolyte
and virtually complete removal of the thorium from the
salt. The discovery that the thorium distribution coef-
ficient in an LiCl-bismuth system is high and that the
rare-earth distribution in the same system is low (a
separation factor of the order 10° or better) has
allowed us to turn to a metal transfer process that is
much more-tractable and does not require an electro-
lyzer. The major part of our effort in chemistry during
this period was devoted to the definition of the
distribution of the system components between the
LiCl acceptor salt phase and a reducing bismuth phase.

Analysis of flowsheets using this new concept has led

reductive extraction step. Calculations made for the
combination of the fluorination—reductive-extraction
and the metal transfer flowsheets promise good system

- performance.

- link in processes proposed for the MSBR, because it

Our development program has not, however, requlred '
drastic revision, since many of the operations required
for the new processes are the same as those required for
the old ones. Our work on contactor development has
continued both with the flow-through system using
bismuth and salt and with the mercury-water simulation

“of the salt-bismuth system. Our axial mixing studies

with the simulated system have led to a design of back-
mixing preventers which seems to be quite effective at
flow ratios (dispersed phase/continuous phase) of 50 or
higher. We have increased our efforts to develop a
continuous fluorinator that will be protected from
corrosion by layers of frozen salt deposited on its metal
surfaces. The work on electrolytic cells has been

- deemphasized, but not terminated, since an onstream

us to consider alternative protactlmum removal

methods which do not require an electrolyzer. The
obvious and most desirable alternative is to return to
fluorination for removing the uranium before the

method of producing lithium-bismuth solutions would
be very useful and since the old reference protactinium
flowsheet would still be a very attractive alternative if
an operable cell were available.

- We have initiated work toward the development of a
continuous process for purifying reactor-grade salt for
both an initial reactor charge and for our experimental

- program, We have also assisted the MSRE operation by

preparing capsules loaded with 23°PuF; for use in

" adding 23°Pu to the fuel.

211 RARE-EARTH REMOVAL USING
THE METAL TRANSFER PROCESS '

L.E. McNeese

We have devised a new process called the metal

transfer process for removing rare-carth and alkaline-
earth fission products from the fuel salt of a single-fluid

- MSBR. In tlus process, blsmuth contammg thorium and

277

lithium is used to transport the rare-earth fission
products from the reactor fuel salt to an acceptor salt.
Although LiCl is the preferred acceptor salt, LiBr or
LiCl-LiBr mixtures could also be used.

Both thorium and rare earths transfer to the bismuth;
however, because of favorable distribution coefficients,

 
 

 

 

278

only a small fraction of the thorium transfers with the
rare earths from the bismuth to the LiCl. The effective
thorium—rare-earth separation factors for the various
rare earths range from about 10% to about 108, The
final step of the process is removal of the rare earths
from the LiCl by extraction with bismuth containing
0.05 to 0.50 mole fraction lithium. The new process
does not require an electrolytic cell. This is an
important advantage over the earlier reductive extrac-
tion process, which also had the disadvantage of
rare-earth—thorium separation factors near unity.
The conceptual process flowsheet (Fig. 21.1) includes
- four contactors that operate at about 640°C. Fuel salt
from the protactinium isolation system, which is free of
uranium and protactinium but contains the rare earths
at the reactor concentration, is countercurrently con-
tacted with bismuth containing approximately 0.002

mole ffaction lithium and 0.0025 mole fraction tho-
fum (90% of thorium solubility) in contactor 1.
Fractions of the rare earths transfer to the downflowing

~ metal stream and are carried into contactor 2. Here, the

bismuth stream is contacted countercurrently with
LiCl, and fractions of the rare earths and a trace of the
thorium transfer to the LiCl. The resulting LiCl stream
is routed to contactor 4, where it is contacted with a

~ bismuth solution having a lithium concentration of 0.05
‘mole fraction for removal of trivalent rare earths.

About 2% of the LiCl is routed to contactor 3, where it
is contacted with a bismuth solution having a lithium
concentration of 0.5 mole fraction for removal of
divalent rare earths (samarium and europium) and the
alkaline earths (barium and strontium), The LiCl from
contactors 3 and 4 (still containing some rare earths) is
then returned to contactor 2.

Calculations were made to identify the unportant
system parameters. It was found that there is consider-
able latitude in choosing operating conditions which

-will yield a stated removal time. The number of stages

required in the contactors is low: less than six in
contactors 1 and 2, three or less in contactor 3, and one
in contactor 4. The process appears to be essentially
insensitive to minor variations in operating conditions
such as flow ratios, reductant concentrations, and
temperature. The required salt and bismuth flow rates
depend on the desired rare-earth removal times.
Conditions will first be considered which give rare-
earth removal times equal to or somewhat shorter than
removal times presently assumed in reactor evaluation
calculations which assume a 50-day removal time for all
rare earths except europium, which has a 225-day
removal time, Table 21.1 shows the effect of number of
stages (V) in contactors 1 and 2 for a typical trivalent
rare earth (Janthanum) and a typical divalent rare earth
(europium). Operating conditions include a 3-day proc-
essing cycle (3 gpm salt flow), a bismuth flow rate of
8.4 gpm through contactors 1 and 2, and an LiC] flow

rate of 11.2 gpm. Contactor 4 was assumed to consist
of one stage, and it was assumed that a bismuth-lithium
solution (0.05 atom fraction lithium) was fed to the
contactor at a rate of 22.7 liters/day. Contactor 3 was
not used.

Thus with two or three stages in contactors 1 and 2
and with volumetric flow ratios near unity, one can
obtain satisfactory removal times with relatively small
processing streams for a three-day processing cycle, If
packed columns were used as the contactors, the
diameters would be approximately 6 in. Since the
number of stages needed is low, the use of mixer-
settlers should not be dismissed, particularly for experi-
ments aimed at demonstrating the process concept.

The rate at which ’Li is removed from the system in
the withdrawal stream is 52.4 g-moles/day. The rate at
which thorium is removed is less than 0.069 g-mole/
day. If the bismuth withdrawal stream were hydro-
fluorinated or hydrochlorinated in the presence of a

279

suitable waste salt in order to recover only the bismuth,

the cost of the 7Li lost would be 0.0018 mill/kwhr.

It is apparent that one can obtain removal times much
shorter than those discussed previously by increasing
the throughput and hence the size of the processing
plant. A three-day processing cycle will be retained in
the following cases; however, other flow rates will be
increased to 10 times the values discussed above. Thus
the bismuth flow rate in contactors 1 and 2 will be 84
gpm, the LiCl flow rate 112 gpm, and the bismuth-
lithium solution flow rate 16 ft3/day.

breeding ratio are within reach if reasonable means are
available for removing uranium and protactinium from
the fuel salt prior to removal of the rare earths and if

‘means for removing the rare earths from LiCl are

lithium solution in contactor 4 are shown in Table 21.2.

It is seen that rare-earth removal times of 3.5 to 15 days
can be obtained depending on the conditions chosen. It
should be noted that one cannot afford to discard

lithjum at the rate associated with this mode  of

operation. Hence, a means for recovering lithium from
the - discard stream from the contactor would be
required. An alternative would be removal of the rare
earths from the LiCl by other means such as contact
with zeolitic exchangers.

‘Variation of breeding ratio vﬁth rare-earth removal
time was calculated and is given in Fig. 21.2. The
changes are given with respect to the base case, which
has a removal time of 50 days for all rare earths except

available which do not result in discard of large
quantities of lithium.

21.2 PROTACTINIUM ISOLATION USING
FLUORINATION-REDUCTIVE EXTRACTION

L. E. McNeese

The fact that the new process for removing rare earths
from a single-fluid MSBR does not require an electro-

Tlytic cell has led us to consider protactinium isolation

europium, which has a 225-day removal time. It should

be noted that if all rare earths were removed on a
five-day cycle, an increase in the breeding ratlo/ of

0.0126 would result; decreasing the removal time to -

three days would result in an increase of 0.014, and a
removal time of seven days would result in an increase

systems that do not require electrolyzers. One protac-
tinium isolation method by which an electrolyzer can
be avoided is fluorination—reductive extraction. In this
method most of the uranium would be removed from
the fuel salt by fluorination prior to isolation of the
protactinium by reductive extraction.

. The fluorination-reductive-extraction system for iso-
lating protactinium is shown in its simplest form in Fig.
21.3. The salt stream from the reactor first passes
through a fluorinator, where most of the uranium is
removed by fluorination. Approximately 90% of the
salt leaving the fluorinator is fed to an extraction
column, where it is countercurrently contacted with a

RARE EARTH REMOVAL TIME, DAYS

Fig. 21.2, Effect of Rare-Earth Removal Time on Breeding Ratio.

‘bismuth stream containing lithium and thorium. The

uranium is preferentially removed from the salt in the

lower extractor, and the protactinium is removed by

the upper contactor. A tank through which the bismuth
flows is provided for retaining most of the protactinium

- in the system. '

The bismuth stream leaving the lower contactor

contains some protactinium as well as the uranium not
removed in the fluorinator and the uranium produced
from - the ‘decay of protactinium. This stream is con-
tacted with an H,-HF mixture in the presence of
approximately 10% of the salt leaving the fluorinator in
order to transfer the uranium and the protactinium to
the salt. The salt stream, containing UF, and PaF,, is
then returned to a point upstream of the fluorinator,
where most of the uranium is removed. The protac-
tinium passes through the fluorinator and is sub-
sequently extracted into the bismuth. Reductant (lith-
ium and thorium) is added to the bismuth stream
leaving the oxidizer, and the resulting stream is returned

to the upper contactor. The salt stream leaving the

upper contactor is essentially free of uranium and
protactinium and would be processed for removal of

- rare earths before being returned to the reactor.

Calculations have shown that the system is quite
stable with respect to variations as large as 20% for

concentrations, and number of extraction stages. The
required uranium removal efficiency in the fluorinator
is less than 90%. The number of stages required in the
extractors is relafively low, and the metal-to-salt flow
ratio (about 0.26) is in a range where the effects of
axial mixing in packed column extractors will be
negligible. Since the protactinium removal efficiency is
very high and the system is quite stable, materials such
as 231Pa, Zr, and Pu should accumulate with the
233py. These materials can be removed by hydro-
fluorination of a small fraction of the bismuth stream
leaving the lower extractor in the presence of salt which
is then fluorinated for uranium recovery. Because
sufficient decay time would be allowed for most of the
233p; to decay to 233U, the 233Pa and %23V losses
would be acceptably low.

Operating conditions that will yield a ten-day protac-

" tinium removal time include a fuel salt flow rate of 0.88

most of the important parameters: flow rates, reductant

gpm (ten-day processing cycle), a bismuth flow rate of
0.23 gpm, two stages in the lower contactor and six to
eight stages in the upper contactor, and a decay tank
volume of 200 to 300 ft3. The required quantity of
reductant is 340 to 420 equivalents/day, which will cost
0.012 to 0.015 mill/kwhr if "Li is purchased.

The remainder of this section is devoted to a
discussion of the effects of important system param-
eters. Unless otherwise stated, the operating conditions

include an operating temperature of 640°C, a process-
ing cycle of ten days, a reductant addition rate of 429
equivalents/day, a protactinium decay tank volume of

1300 ft?, a maximum thorium concentration equivalent

to 50% of the thorium solubility at 640°C, and a
uranium removal efficiency during fluorination of 98%.

* The effect of number of equilibrium stages in the
upper extractor is shown in Fig. 21.4. Less than two
stages are required in the lower contactor; however,
more stages can be used to advantage in the upper
contactor. Approxlmately five stages are adequate, and -

little benefit is obtained from use of additional stages.

Values of the uranium inventory in the decay tank,
which is approxnmately 1% of the reactor mventory, are
also shown. :

The effect of the fraction of uranium not removed
during fluorination is shown in Fig. 21.5. High uranium

removal efficiencies are not required, since there is no
_protactinium removal time is shown in Fig. 21.8. No

effect if as much as 12% of the uranium remains in the
salt. :

- The effect of reductant addition rate on protactinium
removal rate is shown in Fig. 21.6. No effect of -
decreasing the addition rate is seen until one reaches a
value of 390 equivalents/day, after which a gradual but

- significant effect is observed. The changes shown are

also approximately the changes which result from
variations in the bismuth flow rate for a constant inlet
reductant concentration. Hence, there is little effect of
variations in the bismuth flow rate. ,
The effect of processing cycle time on protactinium
removal time is shown in Fig. 21.7. The removal time is
equal to the processing cycle time (100% removal

efficiency) for processing cycle times greater than about

ten days.- As the processing cycle time is decreased
below this point, the system loses efficiency slowly.
This figure shows that the system is relatively insensi-
tive to minor variations in the salt feed rate. -

The effect -of protactinium decay tank -volume on

change is seen as the tank volume is decreased from the

is reached, after which the system loses efficiency
slowly. Smaller tank volumes could be used without
loss of removal efficiency by increasing the reductant
concentration in the bismuth fed to the extractors.

The effects of operating temperature and reductant
addition rate on protactinium removal time are shown
in Fig. 21.9. The optimum operating temperature is
about 640°C, and the system is relatively insensitive to
minor temperature variations. The reductant costs
associated with the addition rates shown decrease in
increments of 0.001 mill/kwhr from a value of 0.015
mill/kwhr for an addition rate of 429 equivalents/day.

21.3 MSBR PROCESSING BY
- FLUORINATION--REDUCTIVE EXTRACTION
AND THE METAL TRANSFER PROCESS

L.kE. McNeese

~ We have now adopted for study a;ﬂoWsheet that uses -

fluorination—reductive extraction for protactinium iso-
lation and the metal transfer process for rare-earth
removal. These processes were described in detail in
earlier sections of this report; this section will be

limited to a description and an analysis of the flowsheet
shown in Fig. 21.10. '

Salt withdrawn from the reactor is fed to a fluori-
nator, where most of the uranium is removed as UFg.
Most of the salt leaving the fluorinator is fed to a
reductive extraction column, where the remaining
uranium is removed and the protactinium is extracted
into a bismuth stream. The bismuth stream containing
the extracted protactinivm flows through a tank of
sufficient volume to contain most of the protactinium
in the reactor system. Most. of the bismuth stream
leaving the extraction column is contacted with an

- H,-HF mixture in the presence of about 10% of the salt

leaving the fluorinator in order to transfer materials
such as uranium and protactinium to the salt stream.
This salt stream is then recycled to the fluorinator.

The bismuth stream leaving the lower column also

‘contains several materials that must be removed for

satisfactory operation of an MSBR. The most important
of these are fission product zirconium, which canbean
important neutron- absorber, and corrosion ‘ product
nickel, which forms an intermetallic nickel-thorium

compound having a low solubility in bismuth. These
materials and others that do not form volatile fluorides

during fluorination are removed by hydrofluorination,
in the presence of a salt stream, of a small fraction of

~the bismuth stream exiting from the lower column. The
salt is then fluorinated for removal of uranium.

Sufficient time is allowed. for the decay of 233Pa so

that the rate at which this material is lost is acceptably

low. The remaining materials, including Zr, Ni, 23! Pa,
and Pu, are withdrawn in the salt stream from the

- fluorinator. Oxidation of part of the metal stream

leaving thé lower contactor is chosen as a means for
removal of these materials, since this results in discard
of no beryllium and very little lithium or thorium;

- discard of salt from other points in the system would
result in much higher removal rates for the major

components LiF, BeF, ,and ThF,. :
The bismuth streams leaving the hydroﬂuonnators are
then -combined, and sufficient reductant (lithium and

thorium) is added for operation of the protactinium
isolation system. Effectively, this stream is fed to the
upper column of the protactinium isolation system;
actually, it first passes through a captive bismuth phase
in the rare-earth removal system in order to purge
uranium and protactinium from this captive volume.
The salt stream leaving the upper column of the
protactinium isolation system contains negligible
amounts of uranium and protactinium but contains the.

~ rare earths at essentially the reactor concentration. This

stream is fed to the rare-earth removal system, where
fractions of the rare earths are removed from the fuel
carrier salt - by countercurrent contact with bismuth

‘containing lithium and thorium. The bismuth stream is

then contacted with LiCl, to which the rare earths,
along with a negligible amount of thorium, are trans-
ferred. The rare earths are then removed from the LiCl

tion of 7Li, Separate contactors are used for removal of -

the divalent and trivalent rare earths in order to
minimize the quantity of ?Li required. Only about 2%
of the LiCl is fed to the contactor in which the divalent
materials are removed. _ ,

Calculations have been made for a range of operating
conditions in order to evaluate the flowsheet just
described. In making these calculations the MATADOR
code was used to determine the reactor breeding ratio
for each set of processing plant operating conditions
examined. Data are not. available on the cost of

processing for this flowsheet or for the reference

flowsheet for the processing system that uses electro-
lyzers in both the protactinium and rare-earth removal
systems. In the absence of these data, we examined
processing conditions which would result in the same
reactor performance (ie., the same breeding ratio) as

“that obtained with the previous reference flowsheet.

- Although the optimum operating conditions which

will result in a breeding ratio equal to that of the .
reference reactor and processing system (1.063) have

not been determined, the following conditions are

believed to be representative. The reactor was processed

on a ten-day cycle, with the complete fuel salt stream
(0.88 gpm) passing through both the protactinium
isolation system and the rare-earth removal system. The
resulting protactinium removal time was ten days, and
the reductant requirement was 350 to 430 equivalents/
day, which costs 0.012 to 0.015 mill/kwhr. The
protactinium isolation columns were less than 8 in, in
diameter, and the total number of required stages was
less than 10. The protactinium isolation system also

~ resulted in a ten-day removal time for materials that are

more noble than thorium but do not have volatile

fluorides. These include zirconium, 23!Pa, plutonium,

the seminoble metals, and corrosion products.
The rare-earth removal system consisted of three

- primary contactors: (1) a 7.1-in.-diam, six-stage column

in which the rare earths are transferred from the fuel
salt to a 12.5-gpm bismuth stream, (2) a 13-in.-diam,
six-stage column in which the rare earths are transferred
from the bismuth to a 33.4-gpm LiCl stream, and (3) 2
12.34in.-diam column in which the trivalent rare earths

are transferred from the LiCl to an 8.1-gpm bismuth
stream having a lithium concentration of 0.05 mole

fraction. Two percent of the LiCl (0.69 gpm) was con- .
‘tacted with a bismuth stream (1.5 ¢cm®/min) having a

lithium concentration of 0.5 mole fraction for removal
of the divalent fission products such as Sm, Eu, Ba, and

Sr. The total lithium consumption rate-for the rare-

earth system was 119 moles/day, which costs 0.0042
mill/kwhr. o :

The rare-earth removal times ranged from 15 5 days

for cerium to 50.4 days for europium. The distribution
data for neodymium, which are believed to be conserva-

~ tive, were used for rare earths for which distribution

data were not available (i.e., Y, Pr,Pm).

The costs for reductant in both the protactinium
isolation system and in the rare-earth removal system -
constitute only a small fraction of the total processing
costs; however, they indicate that one can purchase

- reductant rather than use an electrolytic cell for

producing this material. As data become available on

- processing costs, we will determine operating conditions
that result in the most economic operation of the
processing plant.

22. Measurement of Distribution Coefficients

in Molten-Salt-Metal Systems

L. M. Ferris

The main effort during this reporting period was in
* obtaining data in support of the development of a metal
transfer process for the removal of rare-earth and other
fission products from MSBR fuels. This process (which
is described in detail in Sect. 21.1) involves the
reductive extraction of rare earths and thorium from
the fluoride fuel salt into liquid bismuth and the

subsequent selective oxidative extraction of the rare
‘earths into an acceptor salt such as LiCl or LiBr. The
‘rare earths, and the trace of thorium present with them,

are stripped from the acceptor salt by a lithium-bismuth
solution in which the lithium concentration is at least 5
at. %. A rare-earth—thorium separation factor of at least
10* is possible by this techmque Distribution coeffi-
cients,

were measured at 600 to 700°C for several lanthanide
and actinide elements and for barium using LiCl, LiBr,
LiCl-LiF, and LiBr-LiF salt phases. The systems con-
taining LiF were studied to determine the effect of
fluoride on the process in the event that the acceptor
salt becomes contammated with some fuel salt. -

Expenments were also conducted to deterrmne the

. extractability of barium from LiF-BeF, -ThF, solutions

and to determine the solubility of bismuth in MSBR

fuel salt. Some preliminary work with fluoride salts
contalmng BiF; was done in support of the develop-
ment of electrolytic cells for the reductwe extractxon
process

22.1 METAL TRANSFER PROCESS STUDIES '

F.J.Smith  C.T.Thompson
L.M,Ferris J.F.Land

The equilibrium distribution of several lanthanide and
actinide elements and of barium between liquid bis-
muth solutions and the potential acceptor salts LiCl and
LiBr has been determined. At a given temperature the
distribution coefficients for each element could be
expressed as

log Dy, =nlog X ; +log Ky ,

in which Xj; is the mole fraction of lithium in the
bismuth phase, » is the valence of the element in the
salt phase, and log K§; is a constant. The apparatus and
general technique have been described elsewhere.l»2
The two-phase salt-bismuth systems were contained in
either molybdenum or mild steel crucibles. In experi-
ments with lanthanum, neodymium, and europium,
dried acceptor salt and bismuth were heated together to
the desired temperature under an atmosphere -of pure
argon; then a small amount of thorium was added to-
remove residual oxide from the salt. Finally, a piece of
the desired rare-earth metal was added to the system.
The amount added was such 'that about 50% of the

" rare-earth metal was converted to the halide and

dissolved in the salt, while the remainder was retained
in the bismuth. The rare earth in the salt was extracted

into the bismuth phase in increments by the periodic
addition of lithium-bismuth alloy to the system. In
some experiments, barium metal was added to the

“system when extraction of the rare earth was practically

complete; then the addition of lithium-bismuth alloy
was continued. A period of at least 4 hr was allowed for
equilibration after each addition of alloy. A filtered
sample of each phase was taken after each equilibration.
Analyses of these samples provided the basis for the

290

calculation of the distribution coefficients. In other

experiments, bismuth and dry salt, along with the
appropriate amounts of thorium and uranium metals
(or samarium oxide), were loaded into a molybdenum
crucible. After the two-phase system had been heated to
the desired temperature, the system was treated with
either an HCI-H, or an HBr-H, mixture to convert the
metals or oxide to their respective halides (which
dissolved in the salt) and to remove residual oxygen
from the system. After treatment with pure hydrogen
for several hours, the system was sparged with pure

argon. Extraction of the thorium, uranium, and sa-

marium from the salt was effected by the incremental
addition of lithjum-bismuth alloy to the system using
the procedure outlined above. In some experiments the
thorium that was added to the crucible had been
irradiated to provide about 1 mc of 233Pa. Gamma
counting of samples from these experiments produced
the protactinium data presented below.

Some of the distribution coefficient data obtained in
these studies are shown in Figs. 22.1 and 22.2. Data
obtained for uranium, neodymium, and europium when

LiCl was used as the salt phase are presented (Fig. 22.1)

as plots of log D vs log X; ;. The slopes of the lines
indicate that n is 3, 3, and 2 for uranium, neodymium,
and europium respectively. Plots of log Dp vs log Dy

. and of log Dy; vs log Dy, using data obtained with LiCl
at 640°C are shown in Fig. 22.2. Since uranium was

trivalent, the slopes of the respective lines show that
both thorium and protactinium were tetravalent in the

- salt under the experimental conditions employed.

Values of log K* obtained thus far in our studies using a

-variety of salts are compiled in Table 22.1. These results
‘show that, from a chemical viewpoint, LiCl and LiBr

will be equally good as acceptor salts and that the
distribution behavior of most of the elements will be
rather insensitive to temperature changes.

Inspection of the data in Table 22.1 reveals that the
presence of fluoride in either LiCl or LiBr causes a
change in distribution behavior, particularly that of
thorium. This is illustrated by the data obtained for
thorium and lanthanum'in LiCl-LiF and LiBr-LiF
solutions at 640 and 600°C respectively (Fig. 22.3).

this increase in separation factor would probably be
offset by a loss of neutrons in the reactor due to the
presence of NaF in the salt. '

22.3 SOLUBILITY OF BISMUTH
IN SINGLE-FLUID MSBR FUEL SALTS

L.M.Ferris J.F. I.and_

During the chemical processing of MSBR fuel by
either the reductive extraction or the metal transfer
process, the fuel salt will be contacted with liquid
bismuth before it is returned to the reactor. Since
nickel-base alloys are corroded by bismuth, the pres-
ence of bismuth in the salt could cause serious damage
to a reactor vessel constructed of Hastelloy N. There-
fore a means for ensuring that the fuel salt being

- returned to the reactor is free of bismuth must be

devised. We have attempted to measure the solubility of

‘bismuth in LiF-BeF,-ThF, (72-16-12 mole %) as a

preliminary step in the development of such a method.

About 125 g of salt and 5 g of bismuth were heated
to 700°C in a mild steel container under an atmosphere
of purified argon. Filtered samples of the salt were
taken periodically and were analyzed for bismuth by

both a polarographic and a spectroscopic method. After

75 days at 700°C, the system was cooled to 600°C,
where it was held for an additional 35 days. Although
the analytical data obtained in this experiment are er-
ratic and inconsistent (Table 22.2), it is obvious that
the solubility of bismuth in the salt was low (<5 ppm)
under the conditions used. The cause of the disparity
between the two analytical methods is not known and
must be found before meaningful data can be obtained.

22.4 STUDIES INVOLVING BiF,
C.E.Schilling J.F.Land

Bismuth trifluoride is expected to be produced at the
anode in the electrolytic cells required for the reductive
extraction process.! Therefore, information on the
solubility of BiF; in molten fluoride salts and on the
corrosiveness of salts containing BiF; is desirable. In
preliminary experiments we have found that BiF; is
soluble to the extent of at least 4 mole % both in
LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %) and in LiF-BeF,-ThF,
(72-16-12 mole %) at 600°C. Graphite was the only

material tested that was not rapidly attacked by the
BiF; dissolved in the salt solution.

The BiF; used in these experiments was prepared
from commercial BiF;, which had the approximate -
composition BiF;-BiOF (62-38 mole %). Treatment of
this material with gaseous HF, initially for about 18 hr
at 150°C and then for 5 to 6 hr at 500°C, resulted in a
product that contained less than 3 mole % BiOF. The
weight increase during the HF treatment was in good
agreement with that calculated from the initial and final
oxygen analyses of the material. Other chemical
analyses showed that the F/Bi atom ratio increased
from about 2.3 to 3.0 during hydrofluorination. The
product had a melting point higher than 700°C and did
not attack graphite. When the HF treatment was
conducted in a platinum vessel, a small amount of
metallic bismuth was formed and the platinum became-
very brittle, Embrittlement of platmum by BiF; has
been observed previously.?

Two experiments were conducted to obtain informa-
tion on the solubility of BiF; in molten fluoride salts
and to assess the corrosiveness of melts containing -
dissolved BiF;. In the first experiment, BiF; and
LiF-BeF, -ThF, (72-16-12 mole %) were heated under
argon in a graphite container to 600°C. A solution that

- was 20 mole % BiF; would have been produced if all
the trifluoride had dissolved. Attempts to obtain -
filtered samples of the liquid at 600°C were futile; the
stainless steel samplers were so badly corroded in only

1- to 5-min exposures that they would not function.
Metallic bismuth was one of the corrosion products.
When a nickel thermowell was immersed into the
system, the bottom was corroded away by reaction

with BiF; and/or by dissolution in liquid bismuth, and

salt was ejected from the tube. The frozen salt had the
apparent composition LiF-BeF,-ThF,-BiF,
(68.1-14.7-11.5-5.7 mole %) and did not appear to
contain metallic bismuth. The LiF/ThF, and LiF/BeF,
mole ratios were 5.9 and 4.6, which are about the same
as those in LiF-BeF,-ThF, (72-16-12 mole %). The
graphite container showed no visible signs of attack and
underwent no significant weight change.

In the second experiment, LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %)
and enough BiF; to produce a solution 5.2 mole % (24

- wt %) in BiF; were loaded into a graphite vessel and

were heated to 605°C under argon. After about 28 hr a
filtered sample of the liquid was taken; then the
temperature of the system was varied between 497 and

 600°C, with filtered samples being taken at selected

temperatures in this range. Molybdenum samplers were

“used throughout this experiment. The system was

exposed to molybdenum only during sampling (less
than 10 min for each sample) and during temperature

“measurement (when a molybdenum thermowell was

introduced). As shown in Table 22.3, after a slight
initial decrease the bismuth content of the solution
remained constant at about 20 wt % (equivalent to
about 4.1 mole % BiF;) throughout the first part of the
experiment, even when the temperature was lowered to
497°C. In this part of the experiment, it was noted that
the amount of metallic bismuth in the samples, al-

though small, increased with the number of samples
taken, that is, as the time of exposure to molybdenum
increased. After the fifth sample had been obtained, the
system was heated to 600°C and held there for 24 hr
(Table 22.3). During this time the bismuth concentra-
tion in the salt decreased to about 13%;the amount of
molybdenum found in the salt (2.2%) was only about
two-thirds of that expected for the reaction BiF; + Mo
- MoF; + Bi. After the sixth sample had been taken,
the molybdenum thermowell was immersed in the
liquid, and the system was held at 600°C until the
thermowell was penetrated (i.e., for about 8 hr),
apparently by reaction with BiF;.

The results of these preliminary studies lead to the
following conclusions: (1) Oxygen that is present in

BiF; as BiOF or similar compounds can be removed by

hydrofluorination. (2) The solubility of BiF; in fluo-
ride salts, particularly LiF-BeF,-ThF, (72-16-12 mole
%), appears to be high enough for efficient operation of
the electrolytic cell required in the protactinium isola-
tion portion of the reductive extraction process.! (3)
Graphite is the only material encountered that was not
attacked rapidly by fluoride meits containing BiF;.

Reductive extraction studies with the low-carbon-
steel flow-through system have been continued. The
modifications to the system reported in the last
semiannual report! were effective in improving the flow
control of both the bismuth and the salt streams. These
consisted, in essence, of an expanded chamber in the
line which conducted salt from the column and a
bypass with a freeze valve which could pass the bismuth
trapped by the chamber to the line which conducted
the bismuth stream from the column. Measurement of

pressure between two points in the chamber provides an
indication of large quantities of bismuth draining
through the chamber. By closing a freeze valve at the
bottom of the chamber, it should also be possible to
detect low bismuth entrainment rates.

Four runs were attempted during this period, no one
of which was free from difficulty, Mass transfer of iron
by the bismuth continued to be a major problem,

“despite the reduction in feed tank temperature to lower

the concentration of dissolved iron in the bismuth feed.
The transfer line in which most of the iron deposits
have occurred is the bismuth drain line between the
column and the bismuth sample — a line that is
normally filled with bismuth. However, on one occasion
iron deposits also completely restricted the salt line
between the jackleg and the column; this line contained

flooding of the column caused oscillahon in the salt

flow rate. A short time later 2 metal chip caught in the
valve that controls the level of the salt jackleg and

caused even greater oscillation.

Run 6 was successful in that countercurrent flow was
obtained in the column. The bismuth flow in the period
of most nearly steady flow gradually increased from

ml/min over a 30-min period. During the same period

Orifice Calibration. — Bismuth and salt calibration
runs were made with an orifice meter of the same
design as that calibrated earlier? with mercury and
water. The discharge coefficients for salt were 0.28,

- 0.34, 0.36, and 0,37, respectively, for flow rates of 130,

195, 245, and 295 m!/min, Further experiments with

bismuth provided an average discharge coefficient of

0.73 (standard deviation = 0.07). _
The off-gas connection from the orifice chamber now
includes a mercury seal. In future experiments the

. additional off-gas pressure (above and below the orifice)

indicated by column pressure, increased from 70 to

82% and then decreased to 70%.

An iron deposit in the bismuth exit line during run 7 :

caused bismuth to overflow into the salt exit line. After
the affected line had been replaced, the flow of bismuth
and salt was still intermittent (run 8). Although the
region in which operation was attempted was near
flooding, much of the problem may have stemmed from
iron deposits in the column. We decided to replace the
column as a result of the observed decrease in flooding
rate, Radiographs of the column made before and after
run 8 showed a tight packing arrangement of the

- Y%-in.-diam molybdenum cylinders but did not clearly
show the presence of the dendritic iron deposits, which -
. we found in the lower half of the column when it was

sectioned for direct examination (Fig. 23.4). Air oxida-
tion of the carbon steel column was severe, amounting
to a loss of about 0.050 in. of wall thickness. The
high-temperature aluminum paint applied initially
appeared to have given little protection against oxida-
tion; components and transfer lines that were replaced
after the column was removed were painted with
Markal CR, which the Metals and Ceramics Division had
shown to be generally superior in cyclic tests.

A new column, packed with ¥, -in.-diam molybdenum

~ Raschig rings, was installed in the system, The 84% void

fraction of the new column is much higher than that of

the original column (~40%) and should permit higher

flow rates and minimize the effect of a moderate
amount of iron precipitation. The bismuth-salt dis-
engaging section at each end of the column was
modified to improve scparation of the phases; minor
improvements were made in the design of the entrain-
ment detector located in the salt overflow loop. X rays
were made of the packed section, and pressure drop

will aid in forcing the fluids through the drain line and

will prevent the orifice drain chamber from filling with

liquid, This 1s expected to reduce the scatter in the
data. g

23,2 DESIGN OF A PROCESSING MATERIALS
- TEST STAND AND THE FIRST MOLYBDENUM
REDUCTIVE EXTRACTION EQUIPMENT

E.L.Nicholson  W. F. Schaffer, Jr.
L. E. McNeese E. L. Youngblood

Difficulties have occurred frequently in the engineer-

~ ing development program due to the use of carbon steel

as the material of construction for the experimental
equipment.! The difficulties arise from three sources:
(1) the low strength of carbon steel at elevated

- temperatures (600°C) and the additional loss of

strength that may occur as a result of graphitization
upon prolonged exposure at elevated temperatures, (2)
the poor resistance to air oxidation on external surfaces
at elevated temperatures, and (3) plugging of the
experimental equipment by mass transfer deposits of
iron. These problems were recognized when the equip-
ment was being designed,? and they are being partially
circumvented so that experimental work can continue.
It has always been evident that carbon steel is not a

" satisfactory material for extended use. The refractory

metals molybdenum, tungsten, and tantalum show
satisfactory resistance to salt and bismuth, but the cost
and fabrication problems are too formidable to permit
their use for the first experimental systems. Molyb-

‘denum appears to be the best refractory metal for

measurements across the column were made with -

flowing argon, These measurements will serve as a base
line for future diagnostic tests of the column.

sizes. Recent® and continuing development work (see
Part 5, Materials Development) by the Metals and
Ceramics Division indicates that it is feasible to fab-
ricate small-scale equipment from molybdenum,

We have prepared a preliminary design and cost
estimate and have received approval for a reprocessing
materials test stand and the first molybdenum molten-
salt reprocessing equipment system to be operated in
the test stand. The first test will demonstrate the

~ fabrication of a complex refractory metal system, test

the suitability of molybdenum as a material of con-
struction for reprocessing equipment, and provide
engineering data on packed-column performance with
the bismuth-salt system,

The test stand will be placed in 2 beryllium contain-

ment area in Building 4505, Its associated equipment

will include instrumentation, high-purity gas supply

‘systems, a fill-and-dump vessel for the salt and bismuth

used in the test equipment, and the test stand con-
tainment vessel. The containment vessel will be about
20 in, in diameter by 14 ft high and will be heated and
filled with an inert gas to protect the molybdenum
equipment during high-temperature operation. ,
The first equipment to be installed in the test stand

‘will be a simple reductive extraction system consisting
of a l-in-diam by S-ft-high packed column with

3% -in.-diam upper and lower disengaging sections. Salt
and bismuth will be circulated countercurrently
through the column by gas-lift pumps, which will pump

the streams to elevated 3% -in,-diam head pots for gas

separation, flow measurement, and gravity flow back
through the column, Special instrumentation will
include an interface detector for the lower disengage-
ment section of the column and a device for measuring

‘pressure drop across the packed column, Samplers are’
provided for each stream, and reducing agents (e.g.,

thorium ‘metal) or oxidants (e.g., hydrogen fluoride)

can be added to the system to study their effects on

column performance, The molybdenum equipment will
be suspended by hangers from the top flange of the
test-stand containment vessel so that the loop can be
lifted out for repair or for modifications that would

allow other materials, instrumentation, or flow systems '

to be demonstrated.

‘We have begun to prepare a full-sxze layout of the test
stand and the molybdenum equipment to pinpoint the
problems of clearances and orientation of vessel nozzles
and lines. This will enable Metals and Ceramics Division
personnel to recommend forming and joining tech-

- niques for each vessel and line. We will then prepare the
final design of the system, which will be fabricated and

assembled in the test stand under the supervision of the
Metals and Ceramics Division,

We have nearly completed the detailed design draw-
ings for the head pots. After they have been reviewed,
we will verify performance by constructing and testing
a plastic model. The design incorporates a mechanical
assembly method for the internal baffles, process and

_ instrumentation lines, and an orifice assembly for flow

measurement that minimizes the need for welding. Only
one circumferential weld will be required to join the
two halves of the vessel that are produced by a
back-extrusion forging operation. The spacing and the
size of the nozzle bosses, which constitute an integral
part of the head forgings, are such that the bosses can
be machined to permit attachment of the process and
instrument lines by welding, brazing, or by mechanical
fittings. Final choice of the attachment method will be
specified by Metals and Ceramics Division personnel. '
Mechanical fittings may simplify field assembly
procedures and facilitate the repair of damaged compo-
nents or the addition of new components to the loop in
the future. The Gamah Division of Stanley Aviation
Corporation is investigating the problem of couplings
for molybdenum equipment at no cost to us. They
produce a patented high-pressure metal seal ring
coupling for aerospace use in which the sealing 'is
accomplished by deformation of a flat annular-disk seal
ring. The seal ring can be reused, and only a very low
torque is required to assemble the connector. They have
developed a swaging process for attaching the connector
to pipe or tubing. This process eliminates the need for
welding molybdenum and would produce a strong
leak-tight joint as opposed to a welded joint that is

‘highty fragile and brittle or a brazed joint with reduced

corrosion resistance. We are examining a sample swaged
joint (prepared by the Gamah Division) consisting of
%-in. molybdenum tubing swaged into a simulated
},-in,-diam connector hub, No flaws have been detect-
able by radiography or dye-checking procedures, and
the joint is leak-tight to the limit of sensitivity of our
helium leak-detector equipment (5.9 X 107 cc/sec per
scale division). Metallurgical examination of the joint is
under way. Gamah Division personnel have also pro-
vided us with a % -in. tubing test assembly consisting of
an all-molybdenum connector with 4-in. lengths of
molybdenum tubing swaged into the connector. They
report no leakage of the molybdenum joint with
400-psi helium at room temperature or after exposure
at 1300°F for 7 hr. The joint is now being evaluated by
Metals and Ceramics Division personnel. -

 

 
 

Various small items have been fabricated from molyb-
denum  for use in MSBR reprocessing development
work. The experience has been valuable, although
sometimes frustrating. We wanted to build an electro-
magnetic helical induction pump of molybdenum for
circulating bismuth, Such a pump is not available
commercially, and the refractory metal flow element

would have to be fabricated by ORNL in any case.Ina -

preliminary test of the . fabrication method for the
helical flow element, /s-m -OD molybdenum tubing
was wound at 450 to 500°F on a heated mandrel to
give a 2%-in.-OD, eight-turn coil of satisfactory quality.
Because an actual pump cell would require a coil having
many more turns than this, two commercially available
lengths of tubing were welded together. All attempts to
hot-bend the coil failed due to a break in the tubing in
the brittle heat-affected zone ‘of the weld. The con-
tinuous electrolytic cell testing system is arranged so
that the exit streams from the electrolytic cell flow into

- 2-in.-diam sampling cups before going to the mixer-

settler *ank. Both the sampling cups and the exit tubing
are made of molybdenum. The first two sampling cups
cracked during the welding assembly operation. Some
weld joint designs were modified, and the sequence of

300

assembly was altered, Three satisfactory units and one

additional unit with a minor defect resulted from a
total of six attempts. We also learned that repairs to a
defective weld have a high probability of causing
complete failure of the structure by cracking.. '

23.3 BISMUTH-SALT INTERFACE DETECTOR
~ J.Roth L.E.McNeese

A bismuth-salt interface detector is required for
control of the interface location in salt-metal extraction
columns. The possibility of using an eddy-current
detector is being explored, and equipment has been
fabricated for testing this type of detector. Detectors
having two configurations are to be developed; these
consist of (1) a2 configuration in which the working
fluid (salt or bismuth) is located inside the detector coil
and (2) a configuration in which the working fluid is
located outside the detector coil. In each case the
detector consists of a primary winding (through which
an alternating current is passed) and a secondary
winding (in which a current is induced). The induced
current is dependent on the conductivities of the

materials adjacent to the primary and secondary coils;
since the conductivities of salt and bismuth are quite
different, the induced current reflects the presen(:e or
absence of bismuth, :

‘The principal problem associated with this type of
detector results from the low permeabilities of materials
that can be used with bismuth (e.g., molybdenum or

- low-carbon steel), since these materials will separate the

coils from the bismuth and salt. We are attempting to
use a duplex detector tube consisting of a thin-walled
molybdenum tube (wall thickness of 20 mils or less)
and a type 316 stainless steel tube. Since type 316
stainless steel has a relatively high permeability, the
effective permeability of the resulting tube should be
satisfactory. The electronics system for testing the two
detector configurations has been assembled, and the
detector coil for the first configuration has been
fabricated.

The detector coil for the first confi guratlon shown in
Fig. 23.5, consists of a bifilar winding of 30-gage
platinum wire wound into grooves that have been
machined into the surface of a !% -in.-OD, % ¢-in.-ID
tubular Lavite form, The machined grooves are 0.015
in. wide and 0.015 in. deep, with a round bottom, and
are separated by 0.035 in. of Lavite, The winding,
which is 12 in. long, contains ten turns of each coil per

inch, An end collar 1% ¢ in. in diameter and 1 in. long

is located at the end of each coil. The connecting leads
consist of a twisted pair of wires in order to ensure
minimal connecting lead inductance. The entire assem-
bly is coated with a ceramic glaze to reduce the
probability of external shorting of the coils. _

The power input to the primary coil is supplied bya
Wavetek function generator, model 110, and is approxi-
‘mately 35 kHz at an output of about 15 v. The output

. of the secondary coil will be amplified to about 5 v,

rectified, and filtered, The differential voltage (about
1.5 mv dc) will be recorded.

Preliminary tests of the detector system ‘at room
temperature and at 600°C (nominal operating tempera-
ture) have been made, and required system modifica-
tions have been completed. The equipment has been
installed, with provision for positioning an argon-
bismuth interface at known points within the duplex
tube (molybdenum inside 316 stainless steel) around
which the detector is located,

Equipment for containing and purifying the molten
bismuth, controlling system temperatures and pressure,
and supplying argon and hydrogen to the system 1s also
provided.

23.4 CONTACTOR DEVELOPMENT:
PRESSURE DROP, HOLDUP, AND
FLOODING IN PACKED COLUMNS

J.S.Watson L.E.McNeese

A study of pressure drop, holdup, and flooding rates
in a 2-in.-ID packed column was made by a group of

-MIT Practice School students.! Mercury and water were

used to simulate bismuth and molten salt. We have
previously reported? similar measurements with several
packing materials in a 1-in.-ID column which showed
that the metal dispersion, and thus the interfacial area,
is greatly enhanced by using larger packing sizes (%} in.

or. possibly greater). In order to study larger packing
materials, a larger column and a larger metal pump were

~ installed. The MIT students obtained the first data with
this new equipment.

Two different packing matenals were studied: Y%-in.

tested in the 1-in. column) and % -in. Raschig rings. The

l4in, and 2-in. columns could be compared. The
agreement between the two sets of data is excellent.
Most of the minor differences can be attributed to the
small difference in the void fractions of the two
columns. Because of wall effects, Ys-in. material packs
more densely (i.e., has a lower void fraction) in 2-in.
than in 1-in. columns.

The results for %;-in. Raschig rings are shown in Figs.
23.6—23.8. The pressure drop and holdup curves are
similar to those observed earlier with %-in. packing.
The flooding curve shown in Fig. 23.8 is surprisingly
close to that observed previously with %-in. Raschig
rings. It appears that the flooding data for ¥ -in. solid
packing and for '%- and %-in. Raschig rings can be
represented by a single curve if the superficial velocities
are divided by the void fraction, as shown in Fig. 23.8

and as indicated in Eq. (1). The resulting curve is linear
and has a slope of approximately —1 when the square
roots of the phase velocities are plotted against each
other. These conditions correspond to a constant slip
velocity at flooding. Thus the flooding conditions for

- these three packing materials, using mercury and water,
- can be approximated by a single equation,

(1)

Vil2+ V32 =31€112

where V, and V; are the continuous- and dispersed-
phase superficial velocities, respectively, expressed in
feet per hour, and € is the void fraction. This expression
indicates that the flooding rate does not depend upon
the packing size; however, it is believed that the

AXIAL MIXING IN PACKED COLUMNS

 J.S.Watson L.E.McNeese

We previously reported calculations' of predicted
reductive extraction column performance which indi-
cated that prohibitively long columns would be re-
quired because of the axial backmixing in systems
requiring high volumetric flow ratios (metal to salt). A
rare-earth removal system that exploits the small
distribution coefficient of the rare earths between the
fuel carrier salt and a reducing bismuth phase is a
system of this type. ' -

with imperfect devices) in the rare-earth system when
the flow ratio is 100:1 would be greater than 75% if less

‘than 15% of the salt flowing through a particular

segment is recycled or backmixed to the segment
below. These conditions do not appear difficult to

‘achieve and will result in satisfactory column heights

(probably less than 3 ft/stage).

The type of device under investigation is illustrated in
Fig. 23.9. The metal flows down the annular section of
the upper piece into what is effectively an inverted
bubble cap. As the metal flows over the weir in the
lower piece, it forms a seal that forces the salt to pass
upward through a sieve plate in the center of the
column. The sieve plate is a restriction which can be

~ designed in such a manner that the salt velocity through

the openings will be reasonably high when a low salt
flow rate is employed. Thus one would expect relatively
little back-diffusion of salt through the openings in the
sieve plate, |

Fig'. 23.9. Schematic Diagram of an Axial Mixing Preventer.

We have tested two designs of “backflow preventers”
to date, using mercury and water to simulate bismuth
and molten salt. The column was packed with % -in.-
diam Raschig rings, and at least one backflow preventer
was inserted near the middle of the column. The
countercurrent flow of mercury and water was estab-
lished, and a tracer solution (cupric nitrate) was
injected near the top of the column at a constant rate.
The solution in the column was analyzed for the tracer
at several points down the column on both sides of the
backflow preventers. If the logarithm of the tracer
concentration is plotted as a function of distance down
the column, a discontinuity is observed at the preventer
location, as illustrated in Fig. 23.10. The ratio of the

305

concentrations at the discontinuity is then a measure of

the fraction of solution back-diffusing through the
preventer.

The fraction or percentage of backflow through a
preventer appears to be principally a function of the

water velocity through the sieve opening and of the

diameter of the sieve openings. No dependence of
backmixing on mercury rate was evident; however, the
relatively few changes in mercury rate and the usual
data scatter make this conclusion tentative. It is
expected that a significant dependence on metal flow
~rate would be observed if the metal flow rate were
increased to the point that complete coalescence was
not obtained in the metal downcomer. )

diam holes. One can see that the extent of backmixing
decreases as the water flow rate increases and that
backmixing of less than 15% can be expected (water
flow rate greater than 90 ml/min or 22 ml/min per

hole). The openings were then drilled out to a diameter

of Y, in., and the top curve shown in Fig. 23.11 was
obtained. Again one can see the decrease in backmixing

“as the water flow rate increases. Backmixing did not

reach an acceptably low level in any of these experi-

ments; however, an extrapolation of the curve predicts

“that backmixing would become less than 15% at water

presented in Fig. 23.11. Although there is considerable

- scatter in the data through which the lines were drawn,

the lines are believed to be representative. The first

back flow preventer contained a % -in.-deep bubble cap
and a Y%-in.-thick sieve plate containing four % ,-in.-

ml/min per hole). A second preventer,

rates between 150 and 200 m!/min (approximately 50

\‘guich had a
2-in.-deep bubble cap and only a single ¥ ¢-in.-diam
opening in the orifice, was tested; however, no back-
mixing could be detected at the lowest measurable
water rate (23.5 ml/min). The diameter of the opening
was mcreased to % in., but agam no backmixing was

 
 

 

306

detected. When the diameter of the opening was
increased to % in., the results shown in Fig. 23.11 were
obtained. For this preventer, backmixing was less than

15% when the water flow rate was greater than 50 -
 ml/min. (This value agrees with the results estimated by

extrapolating results from the preventer with four % -in,
holes.) The diameter of the sieve opening was then
further increased to % in., and the results shown in Fig.

23.11 were obtained. Backmixing was increased con-
siderably by this change in diameter; however, at

'-e ¥ ]

sufficiently high water flow rates, backmixing can be
reduced to any desired percentage.
The only undesirable feature of these backmixing

- preventers (other than their complexity relative to

simple packed columns) is their reduction of the

column capacity or flooding rate. The devices just

discussed were operated at metal flow rates as high as
94 ft/hr (column superficial velocity), which is approxi-
mately 15% of the flooding rate for a column packed
with %-in. Raschig rings. At the lower metal rates an

back-transfer of water through the preventer occurred.

It is expected that the design can be improved in order
to allow higher metal flow rates. '

These experiments have demonstrated that devices -
can be designed to reduce backmixing to an acceptable
level. Although the acceptable level has been defined to

be about 15%, one could achieve even lower values if
desired. The principal design parameters are the diam-
eter of the sieve opening and the salt flow rate per hole.
Although openings % in, in diameter or greatér could
be used, the required water or salt velocity increases
very sharply as the hole size increases. At present,
Y,-in.-diam openings appear to be a good choice and
will be effective with a flow rate as low as 50 ml/min

. per hole, The devices are relatively simple; however, the

column capacity is decreased. A greater column capac-

ity may be achieved with larger-diameter columns in

cases where larger bubble caps can be employed.

23.6 AXIAL MIXING IN OPEN COLUMNS

A study of axial mixing in a 2-in.-diam open column
during the counter-current flow of air and glycerol or
butanol solutions was completed by A. M. Sheikh and
J. D. Dearth, of the MIT Practice School.! Axial mixing
is important in the design of tubular reactors such as
continuous fluorinators. Bautista and McNeese? pre-
viously reported results obtained in studies of axial
mixing in the same 2-in.-diam equipment using air and
water. The experimental technique involved photo-
metric measurement of the steady-state concentration
profile, in the column, of a tracer (cupric nitrate) that
was fed continuously to the bottom of the column. The
present study was undertaken to obtain data on the
effects of two physical properties, continuous-phase

viscosity and surface tension, on the axial dispersion
~ coefficient.

Molten salts of interest have a viscosity of about 30
centipoises; water (used in previous studies) has a

- viscosity of approximately 1 centipoise; and the vis-

butanol solutions varied between 37.8 dyneslcm and
the value for water (72 dynes/cm).

The results of the study are summarized in Fig. 23.12,
which shows the dispersion coefficient as a function of
the air flow rate. The dashed line represents the earlier
results of Bautista and McNeese, who found that the
data fall into two regions. The first region, which covers
low air flow rates, corresponds to conditions when
individual bubbles formed at the orifice travel up the
column without coalescence. The second region, which

occurs at air flow rates above 30 cm?®/sec, corresponds

to “slugging” flow.
Increasing the liquid viscosity to 15 centipoises (by
adding glycerol) decreased the dispersion coefficient in

the “bubble” (lower) region; however, the transition

point between the regions was not changed. The

_coefficient increased more rapidly with air flow rate in

the slugging region, at least up to the curve by Bautista

~and McNeese.

Decreasing the surface tension increased the disper-
sion coefficient in the bubble region, although there is
little difference between the data obtained from a
solution having a surface tension of 37.8 dynes/cm and
those obtained from a solution having a surface tension

of 53.2 dynes/cm. The transition point occurred at a
higher air flow rate, and the bubble region .curve
intersected the slugging region curve of Bautista and
McNeese. The dependence of the dispersion coefficient
on air flow rate appears to be somewhat greater than
that observed with air and water, but insufficient data
are available to reach a definite conclusion on this
point.

-This study was especially useful since it represented
the first systematic attempt to vary physical properties
in a bubble column. The data obtained indicate that
higher viscosity and higher surface tension lead to lower
dispersion coefficients, which is in the favorable direc-
tion for molten-salt systems. However, the variation of
physical properties did not cover a wide range of
conditions; also, when liquid mixtures are used, there is
always a possibility that one component will concen- .

“trate at the interface and result in properties in this

region which do not correspond to conditions in the
bulk liquid. Additional studies in the future may
include evaluations of the effects of changing the
column and orifice diameters as well as of changing the
physical properties of the continuous phase,

237 DEMONSTRATION OF THE METAL

RARE EARTHS

E.L. Youngblood W.F. Schaffer, Jr.

J. R. Hightower, Jr.

Equipmeht has been fabricated for the demonstration

~and study of the metal transfer process for removing

rare earths from single-fluid MSBR fuel salt. The first
series of experiments will be made in a carbon steel
vessel 24 in. high by 6 in. in diameter, shown in Fig.
23.13. An internal partition divides the vessel into two
equal-volume compartments, but terminates % in.
above the bottom to allow communication at this level.

309

A bismuth phase saturated with thorium will fill the

first 2 in. of the vessel, and above it, in their respective
compartments, are a fluoride salt phase (72-16-12 mole
% LiF-BeF;-ThF,) and an LiCl phase, each having a
depth of about 3 to 4 in. The fluoride salt will initially
contain about 0.3 mole % LaF;. The compartment
which contains the LiCl accomimodates a double-walled
cup, approximately 1.5 in. in diameter and 9 in. high,
made of carbon steel. The inner wall of the cup is
electrically insulated from the remaindér of the vessel
by quartz spacers. During the experiment the cup will
contain about 200 cc of 0.4 mole fraction lithijum metal
in bismuth. Molten LiCl will be circulated through the
cup containing the lithium-bismuth alloy by a pump

operated with argon pressure. Provision has been made
for sampling all phases and for mixing the metal phases.

To begin the experiment, the three phases in contact
(fuel salt, bismuth, and LiCl) will be allowed to come to
equilibrium, and samples will be taken. The LiCl will
then be pumped through the reservoir containing the
bismuth-lithium solution at a rate of about 25 ¢m?®/min
in order to remove LaCl; from the LiCl. The stripped
LiCl will overflow the reservoir cup and return to the
initial LiCl volume. After a period of about 3 hr, the
circulation of LiCl will be stopped, and the system will
be allowed to come to equilibrium, Then samples will
again be taken. It is estimated that about 20% of the
lanthanum initially present will have been transferred to
the bismuth-lithium strip solution at this point. The
experiment will be continued until the desired fraction
of the lanthanum (50 to 90%) has been transferred to
the strip solution.

A quartz pump with sapphire check valves is being
tested for circulating molten LiCl at 650°C. The pump
was operated successfully for a few hours, but we have
had difficulties with short circuits in the electrical
probes that control the pump and with gradual de-
terioration of the quartz in contact with LiCl. The
deterioration of the quartz is thought to be due to
reaction products that are formed by moisture in the
LiCl; this moisture cannot be removed by heating.
Another test of the pump will be made using LiCl that
has been previously contacted with a thorium-bismuth
alloy to remove impurities. The pump and its control
system are being modified to eliminate the short
circuits.

23.8 FROZEN-WALL FLUORINATOR
DEVELOPMENT

J.R. Hightower,Jr. L. E.McNeese

The ﬂuonnat:on of molten salt to remove uranium is
requlred at several points in processes being considered

~ for the isolation of protactinium and for the removal of
~ rare earths. The fluorinators will be protected from

corrosion by freezing a layer of salt on the metal
surfaces that potentially contact both F, and molten
salt. AIthough the separate aspects of such an operation
_(namely, continuous or batch fluorination and frozen-

~ film formation) have been shown experimentally to be

feasible, the testing of a fluorinator protected against
corrosion by frozen salt has been hampered by the lack
of a corrosion-resistant source for generating heat in the
molten salt. The heat will be provided in a reactor fuel
processing plant by the decay of fission products in the
salt.

- Fig. 23.14. Induction Coil Configurations for Frozen-Wall Fluorinator Tests.

Radio-frequency (rf) induction heating appears to
provide a suitable heat source for experimental work on
fluorinator development; therefore, its use is being
studied. The heat would be generated in the molten salt
(a conductor) by eddy currents induced by an alternat-
ing magnetic field, which would be generated by a coil
not in contact with the molten salt. This method of
generating heat in the salt has the disadvantage that

heat would also be generated in the metal walls of the

fluorinator; however, this can be rmmrmzed by choos-
ing a favorable geometry. ‘

Two promising coil configurations have been con-
sidered; these are illustrated in Fig. 23.14. In configura-
tion I the induction coil is located just inside the metal
wall of the cylindrical fluorinator vessel and is embed-

ded in a frozen salt film on the vessel wall. Heat is

generated by the magnetic field inside the coil, and
neither the coil nor the vessel wall would be in contact
with molten salt and fluorine. In configuration II the
induction coil would be much smaller in diameter than
the fluorinator vessel and would be located at the
center of the fluorinator. A coolant would be passed
through the induction coil in order to keep the coil

- covered with a layer of frozen salt, thereby isolating it
from contact with molten salt and fluorine. Heat would

be generated in the molten salt (and in the vessel wall)
by the magnetic field outside the coil. The second

configuration requires a greater total heat generation
rate than the first configuration since a larger area
would be covered with frozen salt.

Mathematical Analysis. — Initial work on the problem
was directed toward a mathematical analysis of several
coil configurations in order to assess the feasibility of rf
heating and to.identify important system parameters.
Several configurations, including the two shown in Fig.
23.14, were examined. These included a configuration
in which the induction coil was located outside the
fluorinator vessel wall. This configuration would have
to be relatively thin to permit power to be transmitted
through it. It appeared that in this case most of the heat
would be generated in the metal wall for systems having
dimensions of interest; thus this configuration was not
considered further. Since configuration I is more
amenable to mathematical analysis than configuration
I, expressions that predict coil performance were
derived for it. These expressions were then used to
predict the performance of two systems: (1) a salt
system having the -approximate dimensions of an
experimental frozen-wall fluorinator, which will be
built later, and (2) a sulfuric acid system (having
properties similar to the molten-salt system), which is
being used to verify the derived expressions and to
evaluate configuration II. :
 

 

 

 

~The fluorinator system that we examined was as
follows: the salt was L]F-Ber-ThF.; (68-20-12 mole
%), the inside diameter of the %, -in.-thick vessel was 4.9
in., the mean diameter of the induction coil was 3.9 in.,
and the frozen salt extended inward from the wall,
covering the coil and leaving a 1.9-in.-diam molten core.
The metal was assumed to have the same electrical

311

properties as Monel. The heat generation rate in the

molten salt necessary to maintain this frozen salt layer
is 63 w per centimeter of fluorinator length. The
calculated induction current in the coil (at an assumed
frequency of 500 kHz) necessary to produce this power
in the salt was 24.7 amp. The calculated I*R loss in the
induction coil was 55 w per centimeter of fluorinator
length. The heat generation rate in the pipe outside the
coil was estimated by assuming that the magnetic field
strength just outside the coil was equal to the magnetic
field strength just inside the coil. This assumption is
equivalent to assuming that the length of the coil is very
small as compared with the diameter. The calculated
heat generation rate in the vessel wall, using this
assumption, was 65 wfcm (about 1.05 times the heat
‘generated in the salt). Removal of this amount of heat
generated in the vessel wall, as well as that generated in
the salt, would be practical. These calculations indicate
that a 28-kw 1f generator would be required for a
5-ft-long fluorinator vessel. Similar calculations could
not be conveniently made for configuration II.
Experimental Work, — In order to verify the values
predicted for configuration I and to evaluate the
performance of configuration II, experiments were
performed in which a 29 wt % H,S0, solution was

used as a substitute for molten salt. Heat generation -

rates were measured both in the acid solution and in a
Monel pipe surrounding the acid solution. The solution
was contained in a 2-liter graduated cylinder having an
inside diameter of 3% in. The pipe was a 6-in.-long
section of 6-in. sched 40 Monel pipe. The coil for the
test with configuration I was 4 in. ID by 6 in. long and
consisted of 20 turns of Y -in.-diam copper tubing; it

0.75 mho/cm. The heat generation rate in the acid was
about 19 w per centimeter of coil length; this was kept
low to prevent the acid from boiling. The predicted
value for the ratio of heat generated in the pipe to that
generated in the acid solution was 0.58 (calculated
using the experimental system properties, conditions,
and dimensions, and making the same assumptions that
were outlined in the previous section), which is ap-
proximately one-half of the measured value. Deviations
of this magnitude of heat generation rate between the
predicted and measured values are not surprising, since
the method used for calculating heat generation in the
pipe was an approximate one. o

" In five runs with configuration II, the ratio of heat
generated in the pipe to that generated in the acid
solution averaged 0.069. The frequency in this test was
440 kHz. The heat generation rate in the acid solution,
using configuration II, was about 16 w per centimeter
of coil length, although a higher plate voltage was used
than in the experiments with configuration I. This
indicates that the coupling of the magnetic field with
the acid was poorer with configuration II than with
configuration I, which is to be expected since the
magnetic field strength outside a coil is smaller than the
strength inside a coil. However, it means that, even
though little heat was generated in the pipe walls with
configuration II, the efficiency of heating the salt could
still be much less than if configuration I were used,
because the heat generated in the coil itself might be
large as compared with the heat generated in the salt.
This aspect will be explored in future experiments when
means to measure the coil current have been obtained.
 In general, results of these preliminary experiments
and calculations encourage us to believe that inductive
heating is a reasonable method for supplying heat to a
frozen-wall fluorinator experiment in which there is no
internal heat source resulting from fission product

- decay. Disagreement between the measured and the

was placed around the acid container, and the 6-in. pipe

was placed around the coil. The coil for configuration 11
was 1Y in. OD by 6 in. long and consisted of 20 turns
of ‘%-in.-diam copper tubing. It was placed in a
'1%-in.-OD glass tube, which was immersed in the
center of the acid solution. The heat generation rates
‘were obtained by measuring the rate of temperature
increase in the solution and in the pipe.

In three runs with configuration I, the ratio of heat

generated in the pipe to that generated in the acid

solution averaged 1.3. The frequency in the test was
350 kHz, and the conductivity of the acid was about

calculated - values of relative heat generation rates
indicates that the design of an experimental fluorinator
system must rely heavily on empirically obtained
relationships. An expenmental program is under way to
obtain this information.

23.9 ELECTROLYTIC CELL DEVELOPMENT

J.R.Hightower M. S.Lin

Several of the proposed flowsheets for processing
MSBR fuel salt require the use of electrolytic cells,
which would provide reductants (thorium and lithium)

 
 

 

312

at a bismuth cathode and would produce an oxidant
(BiF; in molten salt) at a bismuth anode. An experi-
mental program for the study and development of
electrolytic cells is under way. To date, the experi-
mental work has been carried out in static cells of
various designs; however, a facility that will allow
electrolytic cells to be operated under flow condltlons
at steady state is nearmg completion.

23.9. 1 Static Cell Experiments

. The expenments with static cells have been directed

toward two problems: (1) to determine conditions
under which a protective frozen salt film can be
maintained on electrode dividers in the presence of high

heat generation in the salt and (2) to identify the black

material that has formed in the salt during all runs made
thus far. A successful experiment was made in which
frozen salt films were maintained around the top of a
BeO electrode divider in the presence of high current

density. Three experiments were made in an effort to
identify the black material that forms in the salt dunng :

'electrolysm In one experiment, batteries were used to

provide a constant applied voltage; in another experi-
ment, the cell contained no bismuth; and in the third,
no quartz was present. These experiments are sum-
marized below.

Expenment with a Frozen Salt Fllm on a BeO Elec-
trode Divider. — The cell used in this experiment was
similar to one described previously.! It used a 2%-in.-
OD BeO cup to contain bismuth for the anode and to
electrically insulate the anode from the cathode. A
cooling ring, made of low-carbon steel and located just
above the rim of the BeO cup, supported the cup and
was used to cover the rim of the cup with a protective
film of frozen salt. Coolant was introduced to the ring
and removed from it through tubes that also served as
the anode electrical lead. The anode cup, which had a
cross-sectional area of about 13 cm?, was placed in a
6-in.-diam quartz vessel containing the bismuth cathode
pool. The assembled cell is shown in Fig. 23.15.

The cell was charged with 16 kg of purified bismuth
and 2.4 kg of salt (66-34 mole % LiF-BeF,). Two
successful runs were made in which a frozen salt film
was maintained on the portion of the BeO cup that was
in contact with salt. In both runs the protective salt
film was formed initially with no current flow and with
the top of the BeO cup raised % in. above the surface
of the bismuth pool which formed the cathode. After a

 

M. S. Lin et af., MSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept, Adg.

31, 1969, ORNL-4449, p. 232,

frozen layer had been formed over the cooling ring and
the top of the BeO cup, the cup was lowered until its
top was % in, below the bismuth surface. The assembly
was allowed to remain in this position long enough to
freeze salt on previously unexposed parts of the coolant
intet and outlet lines for electrical insulation. The anode
assembly was then raised until the top of the BeO cup

was Y, in. below the bismuth surface. Operation at this. -

level provided an unmistakable means for detecting
melting of the frozen salt film; that is, in the event that
the film . melted, the cooling ring (which was in
electrical contact with the anode) would contact the
bismuth in the cathode pool, causing a short circuit and
a very high current,

In the first run the current was mcreased stepwise

from O to 20 amp during 2 90-min interval, while the

coolant flow (N,) was increased from 1 to 6 scfm. The
cell was operated for 30 min with a current of 20 amp,
which corresponds to a current density of about 1.5
amp/cm? based on the initial area of the anode. After
this period the current density was increased to 1.7
amp/cm?, and the cell was operated at this level for 10

min. The current density was finally increased to 1.9
ampfcm?, where it was held for 20 min. When the

nitrogen coolant supply was depleted, the current was
gradually reduced, and the run was terminated before

the cell shorted. In this run the salt and bismuth

temperatures were between 465 and 470°C. The cell
resistance decreased during the course of the run from
0.9 to 0.6 ohm, indicating a decrease in the thickness of
the frozen film.

In the second run, water was atomized into the
nitrogen stream in order to increase the cooling
capacity and to permit a longer operating period before
the nitrogen supply was exhausted. During this run the
current was increased stepwise from 5 to 20 amp (1.5
amp/cm?) over a period of about 1 hr. During the next

30 min, the current density was increased to 2.3 -

amp/cm?, where it was maintained for 10 min, The
current - density was then held, successively, at 2.5
amp/cm? for 23 min, 2.6 amp/cm? for 7 min, and 2.8
amp/cm? for 9 min. This run was terminated when the
cell shorted because of insufficient cooling.

These experiments indicate that a layer of frozen salt

can be maintained in the presence of high current
densities if sufficient cooling is provided. It was
necessary in these experiments for the. initial salt and
bismuth temperature to be w1thm about 10°C of the
salt liquidus.

current with -appreciable ac ripple due to incomplete

filtering. This ac component has been suspected to be
responsible. for the formation of the dark material that
has been observed in the salt, since it has been

in molten salts by the use of alternating current. A test
was made to determine whether dark material would be

~ reported? that sols of electrode metals can be produced

Experiment with Nonbismuth Electrodes. — An ex-
periment was made using a 4-in.-diam quartz cell with
no electrode divider to determine whether the dark
material would form in the molten salt when an
electrode material other than bismuth was used. In this

test, two molybdenum electrodes were inserted into the

molten ‘salt (66-34 mole % LiF-BeF,). One electrode

~was a Y-in.diam molybdenum rod located in the

was used. The cell used for this test was made from a

4-in.-diam quartz tube and contained a 3-in.-high quartz

divider, which separated two hemicylindrical bismuth

electrodes, each having a surface area of about 30 cm?.

The cell contained bismuth that had been purified by :

hydrogen sparging and molten salt (66-34 mole %
LiF-BeF;) that had been sparged with hydrogen to

remove residual HF, The power supply consnsted of five
6-v lead-acid storage batteries, each of which was rated

at 200 amp-hr. _ ,
The cell was operated initially at S00°C with a
current of -3 amp, Fragments of dark material, ac-

center of the cell; the other was a ¥;-in.-diam molyb-
denum tube, essentially sheathed in quartz, which was

 located near the side of the cell.

~ An alternating current of 2 amp was first passed

‘threugh the cell. A small amount of dark material was
formed, primarily at the electrode containing the quartz

sheath. With a direct current of 5 amp, the salt in the
cell darkened completely within about 1 min. The salt
cleared substantially after being allowed to stand

. overnight, but there were still a few large particles of

companied by some gas evolution, could be seen rising

from the anode surface; within 9 min the salt became
opaque. After being allowed to stand overnight, the salt

became clear. Another run at 600°C with a current of 2

amp caused the salt to become opaque within 6 min as

a result of material emanating from the anode. After.
being allowed to stand overmght the salt again became :

clear.

Two more runs were made one at a cell temperature

of 675°C with a current of 2.8 amp and the other ata
cell temperature of 680°C with currents as high as 45

* amp. No dark material was formed duting these runs.

An additional run was attempted at a cell temperature
of 500°C, but the presence of a large amount of
precipitate (apparently produced during the previous
runs) obscured the visibility to such an extent that we
could not determine whether any dark matenal was
formed during the run.

The conclusions to be drawn from this experiment
are: (1) The ac ripple in the power supply is not
responsible for the production of the dark material and
(2) the dark material may not be formed at high
temperatures. It is possible that the black material is a
product (such as BiF3) of the reaction of the anode
material with ‘the quartz in the cell. If this is true, the

black material suspended in the salt and a’scum of black

material at the salt-gas interface. A 5-amp (dc) current
was again passed through the cell, and the salt became
opaque within 1 min. A small amount of gas was
observed at the anode. '

We conclude that the formatlon of dark material

during electrolysis is not related to the use of blsmuth

‘electrodes.

All'Metal Electrolytic Cell Experiment, — The third
experiment in this series was made to determine

‘whether ‘the dark material is formed in the absence of

quartz. The cell vessel in this experiment was an 18-in.
section of sched 40 mild steel pipe. One electrode
consisted of a bismuth pool 3% in. deep, and the other

was a ¥-in.-diam mild steel rod located at the center of -

the vessel and placed % to % ‘in. above the bismuth
pool. Observations in the salt phase were made by using
the bismuth surface as a mirror to reflect light to a sight
glass in the top flange of the vessel. A 3% -in.-deep layer
of molten salt (66-34 mole % LiF-BeF,) was present

700°C with hydrogen to reduce oxides, and the salt had
been sparged with hydrogen to remove dissolved HF,
The cell was first operated with the iron rod as the

 anode and the bismuth as the cathode. The cell

temperature was 550°C, and the distance between the

elevated temperatures, or the rate at which it reacts

with .the quartz at these temperatures is sufficiently

current of about 25 amp. The current was not steady;

an oscﬂlatmg component with a 2- to 5-amp amplitude -

and a 10-sec period was superimposed on a near-
constant current of approximately 25 amp. The oscilla-

tions were probably caused by the formation and the
breaking away of an insulating iron fluoride scale.

Streamers ‘of a dark material were seen moving from
outside the field of vision (which did not cover the
whole bismuth surface) toward the iron anode, and
within 1% min of operation the .salt was opaque.
Filtered salt samples were taken before and after
passage of current; an unfiltered sample was also taken
after this run. The unfiltered sample showed high
concentrations of iron and bismuth. The high iron con-

_centration was not surprising, since iron fluoride would

have been formed at the anode. The bismuth in the
sample . probably came from a scum (metallic in
appearance) on the salt surface.

Another run was made using a2 new iron electrode the
bismuth pool was the anode and the iron rod was the

cathode, Ob_servations during this run were hindered by

* the metallic scum, mentioned above, which covered

most of the salt. However, we were able to observe
some of the salt near a sparge tube at the edge of the
bismuth pool. The electrode separation in this run was
1 in., and the cell temperature was 550°C. In this run
we impressed 2.5 v (dc) across the electrodes, which
resulted in a current of about 25 amp. The current was
steady, and the salt (when we could see it) was clear.
Gray particles (~" ¢ in. in diameter) could be seen
above the bismuth surface, moving under the action of
thermal convection currents, A current was passed
between the electrodes for about 5 min, and the salt
remained transparent. Near the end of the 5-min period,

| 24. Distillation of MSRE Fuel Carrier Salt

J.R. Hightpwer, Jr. L.E. McNeese

.Final analyses were obtained for the eleven con-

densate samples taken during the MSRE distillation

experiment. These samples were analyzed for LiF,
BeF,, Z1F,, and the fission products °5Zr, 144Ce,
147pm, 155Ey, 'Y, °°Sr, 8°Sr, and '37Cs. The
results of  these analyses are presented as effective
relative volatilities, with respect to LiF, which are given
by the relationship

Qi LiF = K ,

Y Yiie/Xuir

where Y| ;g and Y; are mole fractions in the condensate
and Xj;r and X; are mole fractions in the still pot.

Concentrations in the still pot were not measured
directly; however, data taken during the experiment

(1)

“allowed these concentrations to be estimated from

material balances for each component.

The most self-consistent relative volatility values
resulted from assuming that the feed salt composition
was 65-30-5 mole % LiF-BeF,-ZtF, (which is the

"MSRE fuel carrier salt composition) rather than the

composition indicated by the analysis of salt from the
fuel storage tank. The slight difference in the two
compositions is probably due to the presence of
zirconium metal in the salt in the fuel storage tank. This
metal would have been filtered out when the salt was

~ transferred to the still feed tank.
The effective relative volatilities of the major salt -

constituents (BeF, and ZrF,;) and of fission product
®SZr are shown in Fig. 24.1. The effective relative
volatility of BeF, was essentially constant during the

" run and had an average vatue of 3.8. This value agrees

favorably with a value of 3.9 measured by Smith,
Ferris, and Thompson,! but is slightly lower than the

(January 1968). - ' :

value of 4.7 measured by Hightower and McNeese.2
Slight approximations in calculations and errors in
analyses would account for this difference. The effec- -
tive relative volatilities of fission product 3Zr and of

the natural ZrF, present in the carrier salt are in

agreement. If the analysis of the fuel storage tank salt
had been used as the composition of the feed salt in the
relative volatility calculations, the resulting relative
volatility of natural ZrF, would have been about
one-half of that of ?5ZiF,. Figure 24.1 shows that
07 :F4-LiF decreased from an initial value near 4 at the
start of the run to about 1 at the end of the run. These
values bracket the value of 2.2 measured by Smith et al.
in a salt mixture having a ZrF, concentration of 0.0008
mole fraction (which is about 2% of that present during
the distillation experiment). ,
The effective relative volatilities for the lanthanide-
fission products !*#Ce, 14"Pm, and ***Eu are shown
in Fig. 24.2. The effective relative volatility of 1*%Ce

rose sharply from 6.1 X 107*, at the time the first

sample was taken, to about 1.0 X 1072, where it
remained during the rest of the run. An exception was
the value for the fifth sample, which was lower than 1.0
X 1072 by a factor of 3. The low initial value was 1.5
to 3.4 times the value measured in an equilibrium still;>
the values during the major portion of the run were 24
to 56 times the value measured in the equilibrium still.
The effective relative volatility for 14 7’Pm was based
on a computed feed concentration and took account of

- the MSRE power history. The computed feed concen-

tration of '*7Pm was felt to be a more accurate value
than the measured feed concentration, which was only

about 30% of the expected value, since measured

concentrations of other lanthanide fission products
agreed well with computed values. As in the case of
144Ce, the relative volatility of **7Pm was low (<7.8

X 107%) at the time the first sample was taken; it then

rose sharply to about 3.4 X 1073 for the remainder of

“the run. Also, as in the case of !**Ce, the relative
~volatility was low at the time the fifth sample was

taken, The relative volatility of promethium had not
been measured previously.

 
 

 

The variation of the relative volatility of '35Eu
during the run. closely paralleled variations of the
relative volatilities of !*4Ce and '*7Pm. The value for
the first sample was low (less than 1.5 X 1075);
however, the values for all the other samples, except the
fifth sample, were higher (about 2.2 X 107*). The value
for the fifth sample was lower than 2.2 X 107 by a
factor of 2.6. The effective relative volatilities during
the MSRE distillation experiment (based on a com-

318

puted feed concentration of !$5Eu) were lower than .

the value of 1.1 X 107® which was measured in
recirculating equilibrium stills, However, the analysis

* for '35Eu in the condensate samples is suspect since

there was some difficulty in this analysis; thus all of the
155By data obtained for the condensate samples were
reported as approximate values. On the other hand, it is

run closely paralleled the relative volatilities of ***Ce
d 147Pm

Figure 24.3 shows the effective relative volatilities of
°1Y and °°Sr. During the run the effective relative
volatility of 'Y had an average value of 1.4 X 1072}
about 410 times the value measured in recirculating

equilibrium stills. The variation of ay, v.Lip V3 similar

to variations of relative volatilities of the lanthanides; -
the low value for the fifth sample was most noticeable.
The effective relative volatility of °°Sr (based on the -
measured concentration in the feed) had an average
value during the run of 4.1 X 1073, about 84 times the
value measured in recirculating equilibrium stills. Al
though it is not shown in Fig. 24.3, the average value of
the relative volatility of 8?Sr (based on a computed

" concentration in the feed) was 0.193, about 3900 times

the value measured in equilibrium stills. In the con-

‘densate samples the ratio of the ®°Sr activity to the

 significant that the variation of a; 5 S b u.LiF during the

99gr activity, which should have been about 0.002 in
each case, varied from 0.22 to more than 10 (Table
24.1).

Because the concentration of !27Cs in the feed salt

‘They were obtained by assurning that all precursors of

volatility were based on an estimated feed concen- -

tration. However, !37Cs has a fairly long-lived gaseous

precursor (137Xe, half-life of 3.9 min), which caused

‘the actual '37Cs concentration in the salt to be less

points around the upper line represent upper limits for

 the relative volatility of '37Cs determined from the

results of the experiment. They resulted from a feed

Also, because the actual relative volatility of CsF is
fairly high, the results of calculations of the effective -

relative volatility are sensitive to the assumed feed

concentration of 137Cs. Figure 24.4 shows calculated |

relative volatilities of *37Cs for two assumed feed
concentrations. The points around the lower curve
represent the lower limits for the relative volatility.

137Cs in the still pot liquid would not become negative.
‘The highest effective relative volatility of ! 2?Cs seen in

these - calculations was only about 20% of the value

measured by Smith et 4l. in LiF-BeF, systems. '
These results show that all of the components except

BeF, and Z1F 4 had effective relative volatilities which

differed (drastically in some cases) from values pre-

dicted from tests with equilibrium systems. Possible

| Fig. 24.3. Effective Relative Volatilities of 'Y and ®°Sr in the MSRE Distillation Experiment.

‘causes for the discrepancies include: (1) entrainment of

droplets of still pot liquid in the vapor, (2) concentra-

tion gradients in the still pot, and (3) contamination of

samples during their preparation for radiochemical
analysis.

Entrainment was suspected for a number of reasons.
Entrainment of only 0.023 mole of liquid per mole of
vapor would account for the high relative volatilities
calculated for the slightly volatile fission products
144Ce, 147Pm, °'Y, and °°Sr. Entrainment rates of
this order would not be reflected in- the effective
relative volatilities of more-volatile materials (a > 1).
The high correlation of the scatter of the calculated
effective relative volatilities of different slightly volatile
fission products is consistent with the hypothesis that
entrainment occurred,

Since entrainment was not apparent in the nonradio-
active operation of the still,® reasons for entrainment in
the radioactive operation were sought to support the
hypothesis. Evidence of a salt mist above the salt in the
pump bowl at the MSRE and above salt samples
removed from the MSRE has been reported,*** and
studies have indicated that these mists are present over

radioactive salt mixtures but not over nonradioactive
mixtures. However, examination of data from these
studies showed that entrainment rates large enough to
explain the results of the MSRE distillation experiment
could be ‘obtained only by assuming that the salt
concentration in the gas space above the salt during this
experiment was equal to that seen above salt in the
pump bowl at the MSRE. If the mist formation rate
decreases as the power density in the liquid decreases,
the concentration of salt in the mist should also
decrease with decreasing power density in the liquid.
Since the salt used in the MSRE distillation experiment
had a much lower power density (400 days decay for
distillation feed as compared with less than 30 days

decay for salt samples tested for mist formation) than
salt samples from the MSRE, it seems unlikely that the
concentration of salt in the gas above the salt would
have been high enough to explain the high relative
volatilities for the slightly volatile fission products. In
addition to the argument against the entrainment
hypothesis given above, not all discrepancies would be
explained by it. For example, it would not account for
the variations in the ®°Sr-activity-to-® °Sr-activity ratio
or for the low value for the effective volatility of
137CS.

Concentration polarization would cause the effective
relative volatilities of the slightly volatile materials to be
greater than the true relative volatilities. As more-

volatile materials vaporize from the surface of the

liquid, the slightly volatile materials would be left
behind on the surface at a higher concentration than in
the liquid just below the surface. The concentration of
these slightly volatile materials in the vapor would then
increase, since further vaporization would occur from a
liquid with a higher surface concentration of slightly
volatile materials. Since effective relative volatilities
were based on average concentrations in the still pot,
the vapor concentration would be higher than that
corresponding to the average liquid concentration, and
the calculated effective relative volatility would be
higher than the true relative volatility, Concentration
polarization would cause the effective relative volatility
to be lower than the actual relative volatility for a
component whose relative volatility is greater than 1.

The extent to which concentration polarization af-
fects the effective relative volatility of a particular

component depends on the dimensionless group D/vL,
which qualitatively represents the ratio .of the rate of
diffusion of a particular component from the vapor-

liquid interface into the bulk of the still pot liquid to

the rate at which this material is transferred by
convection to the interface by liquid moving toward the
vaporization surface. In this ratio, D is the effective
diffusivity of the component in interest, v is the
velocity of liquid moving toward the interface, and L is
the distance between the interface and the point where
the feed is introduced. |

The occurrence of concentration polarization is sug-
gested by the sharp increase at the beginning of the run

in the effective relative volatilities of 144Ce, *47Pm,
155Ey, and possibly of ®!'Y and °°Sr. This increase
would correspond to the formation of the concen-

tration gradient in the still pot liquid. The effective

diffusivities of NdF; in the still pot, calculated from
results of the nonradioactive experiments, ranged from
2.1 X 10™ to 18.3 X 10™* cm?[sec and form the basis
for estimating the magnitude of the concentration
polarization effect in the radioactive operation. During
the semicontinuous operation at the MSRE, the liquid
velocity - resulting from vaporization averaged 2.2 X
10™* cm/sec, and the depth of liquid above the inlet
was about 94 cm. If one assumes that the effective
diffusivities of the fission products in the still pot
during the MSRE distillation experiment were in the
same range as they were during the nonradioactive tests,
the observed relative volatilities of the slightly volatile
materials would be only 1.8 to 11.5 times the true
relative volatility, and the observed relative volatility of
137Cs would be 0.012 to 0.023 times its true value
(assuming in each case that the true relative volatilities
were those given in refs. 1 and 2). Although concentra-

tion polarization may have been significant in the work

with radioactive salt, the effect is not great enough to
account for the discrepancies between observed relative
volatilities and what we consider to be the true values,
Also, concentration polarization would not explain the
variation in the ratio of ®9Sr activity to ®°Sr activity
between samples of condensate.

The possibility  that the condensate samples were
contaminated while they were being prepared for
radiochemical analysis is suggested by the wide varia-
tion in the value of the 3°Sr/?%Sr activity ratio.
Although routine precautions against contamination
were taken in the hot cells, where the capsules were cut
open, no special precautions were taken, and the
manipulators used to handle MSRE salt samples were
also used to open the condensate samples. If it is
assumed that the source of the contamination was the
last salt sample taken from the MSRE before the
distillation samples were submitted, only 107 to 1073
g of salt per gram of sample would be required to yield
the observed values of the 32Sr/°%Sr activity ratio.

‘Contamination from such small quantities of material

would be extremely difficult to prevent.

Other observations explained by assuming that the
samples were contaminated are the high relative vola-
tilities of the slightly volatile fission products and the

“high correlation between the variations of calculated
 

 

o

(»

 

- 323

relative volatilities of different fission products. The
low relative volatility for ! 37Cs is not explained by this
hypothesis. .
We conclude that, although several factors may be
involved, the discrepancy between the effective relative

volatilities of the slightly volatile materials measured in
this experiment and the values measured previously is
primarily the result of contamination of the condensate
samples by minute quantities of salt from other MSRE
salt samples in the hot cells.

salt, In the calculations it was assumed that salt for
processing is withdrawn continuously from the reactor
at 2.53 gpm and that purified makeup salt is added at
the same rate. Values on . the flowsheet pertain to
equilibrium conditions when fission products and
233Pa are being removed according to the cycle times
given in Table 25.1. This table denotes the dominant
removal process and cycle time for 223Pa and for each
family of fission product elements; for all practical

-purposes, most of the fission products are removed by

more than one mechanism, For example, _the noble
gases are removed primarily by sparging the fuel salt in

the MSBR fuel circuit; however, in fuel processing,

removal is also accomplished whenever the salt is
fluorinated or treated with an H, purge stream.

25.2 EFFECT OF CHEMICAL PROCESSING
'ON THE NUCLEAR PERFORMANCE OF
 ANMSBR

M. J. Bell _ L. E.McNeese

A series of calculations has been ‘per‘fo'rined to

investigate the effect of the removal of individual
fission product elements on the performance of an
MSBR. These calculations were made with a computer
code called MODROD! which resulted from combining
the ROD? (reactor optimization and design) and the

MATADOR? (steady-state material balance) codes. This
combined code allows an accurate treatment of the
neutron production and loss in the reactor core and a
more complete description of radioactive decay and
neutron capture by the fission products. The calcula-
tions were performed for a 2250-Mw (thermal) single-
fluid MSBR fueled with 1680 ft* of fuel salt of nominal

" composition = 71.7-16.0-12,0-0.3 mole % LiF-BeF,-

ThF,-UF,. Further details of the reactor concept are
given in ref. 4.

In the calculations which were performed, the effect
of chemical processing on the neutron poisoning by

- individual fission product elements was investigated by

varying the efficiency with which an element was
removed from the fuel salt with respect to a reference

- value. The reference case assumed that: (1) halogens
~ and rare earths were removed on a 50-day cycle, (2)

zirconium and seminoble metals were removed on a

200-day cycle, (3) protactinium was removed on a S-day

" cycle, and (4) the salt was discarded on a 3000-day

cycle to remove the active metals and neptunjum. In
addition the noble gases and noble metals were treated
as described in ref, 3. They were assumed to have a
50-sec residence time in the fuel salt and a 110-sec
residence time in the helium bubbles; the surface
resistance for diffusion of the noble gases to the
graphite was fixed to give a poisoning of 0.5% for
135Xe. The removal efficiency for each individual
element from Zn to Ho, except for Kr and Xe, was

varied from 2% to 27°. These conditions differ slightly .

from those used by Baumann® to optimize the reactor
design and resulted in a breeding ratio of 1.061 and a
fuel yield of 3.2% per annum for the base case. The cost
associated with the inventory and replacement of fuel
and carrier salt amounted to 0,27 mill/kwhr,

Figures 25.2—25.5 illustrate the effect of chemical
processing for the elements Nd, Sm, Pm, and Zr on the
performance of the reference MSBR. The changes in

fuel yield and fuel cycle cost from those determined for
the base case are shown as functions of element removal
time. The changes in fuel cycle cost result only from
changes in the inventory charges for additional fissile
material that would be required if an element were
removed less efficiently than in the base case. The
elements whose -poisoning can be influenced most by .
chemical processing are the rare earths, Zr, Ba, and Sr.
For a number of materials, primarily the noble metals,
no  significant variation in reactor performance was
observed over the range of removal times investigated.
The lack of influence of the noble metals results from
the assumption that these materials are removed on a
short (50-sec) cycle in the base case. However, if longer
removal times were established, removal of these

“elements by chemical processing would become im-

portant. Additional results and details of the com-
putational procedure are given in ref. 1.

26. Continuous Salt Puriﬁbation System

R. B. Lindauer

E. L. Youngblood

Equipment is being installed to study the continuous
purification of moltensalt mixtures as a possible
replacement for the present batch method.! The first
step to be studied will be the continuous reduction of
dissolved iron fluoride with hydrogen. The equipment

(Figs. 26.1 and 26.2) to be used in this study consists of
a .1%-in.-diam by 7-ft-long nickel column packed with-

1,-in. nickel Raschig rings, a 0.69-ft*> fiber metal filter
(50-u rating) for separating the reduced iron from the
salt, a flowing stream sampler, and two 20-liter tanks.

L.E.McNeese
E. L. Nicholson

The interface will be positioned at the bottom of the
column by means of a control valve in the exit gas
stream, We will follow the progress of the reduction
step by analyzing salt samples and by continuously
analyzing the HF content of the column exit gas
stream. A sodium fluoride trap will be used to remove

absolute filter and is discharged. |

~ Construction of the system in Building 4505 has been
completed, and the equipment has been leak tested.
Construction of the HF, argon, anid hydrogen supply
systems is still in progress. The argon and hydrogen
systems will contain oxygen and moisture removal

331

equipment and instrumentation for continuously mon- .

itoring trace amounts of these gases.
The first steps in the experimental program will
consist of charging 15 liters of molten salt (66-34 mole

% LiF-BeF,) to the system and determining the .
flooding rates of the column, both with the purified salt
and with salt containing about 150 ppm of oxide. The
oxide will be added to the salt in the feed tank and will
later be removed by sparging with H, -HF. It is expected
that salt flow rates as high as 200 cm?/min can be used
with hydrogen gas rates up to 100 liters/min. Initial
operation will be at 700°C. After the study of the iron
reduction step has been completed, the oxide removal

- step will be demonstrated in the column, Studies with

salt containing thorium fluoride will also be made.

last six capsules contained 39.2 to 42.2 g of PuF;. No

problems were encountered in the filling operation or in
packaging the capsules in the MSRE fuel sampler-
enrichér charging containers. The exteriors of the
loaded charging containers were smeared and found to
be free of transferable activity before the containers
were sealed in plastic bags. No detectable contamina-
tion escaped from the glove-box operation. Similar
techniques .could probably be used with much larger
powder containers to add plutonium to a barren salt.
