Iotroduction

To raduce down-time during maintenence operations on the molten salt
pover reactor system to a minimum, the phil@sgphy has been adopted that
all system components on which diract mainbtenancs is not possible shall
be removable and replaceable with sparss, by reamote manipulation. Re-
pair work on falled compomants shall be accomplished in suitably equipped
independsnt facilities,

It is preregquisite to ths removal ard replacemsnt of system com-
ponzctbs by remote manipulation that a reliable msethod be developed for
parting system pipipng and rejoining it to its originsl integrity. Until
prasent experimsntal efforts to perform critical welding remotely have

uceeedaed to the point wherse they can be applied with confidence to the
maintenasce of a reactor system, the use of mechanical Joints for this
porpose most be considered. The cobjective of the work reported here was
to scresn the various concepts of mechanical Jolnts offered by individuals
or groups within the Reactor Projects Division, and to selact for develop-

ment those showing promise of successful application,

 

Thrae small scale mechanical pipe joints of alternative types were
tasted in a fused salt pump loop, The Joints werse cold leak checksed on
a mass spactrometer lsak detector kefore installation in the loop, vare
then lustalled and subjected to a saries of thermal cycles betwaen 1100
and 1300°F, removed from the loop and leak chackad., The Joints were
then parted, remads; and lzak chacked again, An indicated lesk rate of
less than 1 x .1.()@7 ce of halium per second was reguired for acceptable

parformance at =ach check.
Of the three joints tested, the "freeze flange" Joint was found sat-
isfactory for immediate development, the "indented seal" Joint was found
promising if modified, and the "cast seal” joint was found not suitable
for development.

In accordance with these results, further tests of the small-scale
"freezs flange” and "indented seal’ joints have been initiated with sodium
as the process fluld, and a pair of "freeze flange" Joints in 4" pipe size
has besn fabricated for testing in a large fused salt system. Results of

these tests will be reported separately.

Descripbion of Test Joints
3.1 Criteria for Joint Performance
For the screening tests, the following criteria were used, based upon
the Prelimiusry Mechanical Joint Specification (see Appendix 1) prepared by
the MSEP Group: |
(a) The joints shall be fabrieated of materials compatible
with fused fluoride salt fuels.
(b} The joint leak rate, cold, before installation in the test
loop, shall be less than 1 x 1077 cc of helium per second, as in-
dicated by comparison with a standard leak used in conjunction with
a mass spectromeler leak detector.
(¢) The joint shall be installed in a test loop circulating fused
salt and subJjected to a minimum of 50 thermal cycles between the
temperatures of 1150 and 13%00°F,
(4) No fluid leakage shall be acceptable,
(¢) Upon completion of the thermal cycling tests, the Joint shall

bs cut from the loop and cold leak checked {sse 3.1.Db).
(£} It shall be demonstrated that each joint can be parted and
remads accaptably leak tight, without requiring more than super-
ficial cleaning, etc., such as could be psrformed Dy remote

mayipulatlon,

%.,2 Fresze Flange Joind

The principle of the frozen ssal mechanieal jolunt, or frseze flangs,
is illustrabed in Fig, 1, The frozen salt seal is formed in the gap
vetween the flange faces. The ring insert provides a labyrinth re-
striction to the passage of salt into the gap. The labyrioth is im-
portant only when the test loop was filled with salt, before the frozen
saal was formed. After the frozen seal is forwmad, 1t retains the molten
salt in the process stream. The metal seal ring provides s gas-tight
seal , walch retalos fission gases. For an effectlive gas seal, it was
found necaesseary to manufacturs the seal ring to close toleracces., The
0. D, and 1. D, of the ring were within 0.004% inches on a diasmeter of
seven inches, and concentric within 0.001 inches, The finish requirsd
wvas sixteen microinches. The same Lolerancaes were reguired in making
tha geal ring groove in the flange faces,

An alr chnsnpel, in each balf of the Tlangs asssmbly, provides cool-
ing for the seal ring and insurss the formation of the frozen salt seal.
Toe flange hass a thin cross saction between the flange hub, which
is welded to the loop tubing, and the seal ring, near the outer edge of
the flangs, This was designed to pressat a small cross sectional area
for radial beat conduction. FPour webs add strength to the flange and re-
duce warping.

On the test installation, sight gulck-opsuing toggle clamps wers

Flg. 2 shows the assembled flanges with clam shell type heaters,
located on the loop tubing immediately before and after each flange as-
sembly. Referring to the figure, the various parts are as follows:

(1) Air cooling lines, (2) Calrod heaters leads, (3) Quick-open toggle
clamps, (4) Thermocouple leads, (5) Clam shell heaters, (6) Insulation.

There Were no heaters nor was there any insulation 6n"the flange
assemblies.

The flanges were made of Inconel. The seal rings for the first
test were of stainless steel. In subsequent tests, soft iron and an-

nealed copper seal rings were used.

3.5 Indented Seal Joint

This mechanical joint is illustrated in Fig. 3.. A dead-soft an-
nealed metallgasket is used to seal the two flange halves., A raised
tooth of V-shaped cross section, machined on the face of each flange,
indents the flat metal gasket to provide a tight gas seal. Actual
parts are shown in Figs. 4 and 5.

A thin cross section between the flange hub and gasket, near the
outer edge of the flange, presents a small cross sectional area for radial
heat conduction.

On the test installation, four standard design "C" clamps were used
on each flange assembly to provide the force necessary to indent the
gasket and maintain a gas leakage rate below the maximm allowed. Fig. 6
shows an assembly with clamps.

The flanges were made of Inconel. For the first test, a dead-soft

annealed copper gasket was used in one flange assembly, and an annealed

Armco iron gasket in the other assembly.

3.4 Cast Seal Joint

A cross section of this mechanical Joint is shown in Fig. 7. Four
stainless steel bolts provide the mechanical strength for the Joint. A
metal insert, shown in the figure before being fused, is used to provide
a salt and gas seal. The metal insert is fused between the flange faces
before the test loop is filled with salt. The seal whose melting point
is above that of the fuel salt, is in the solid state during operation
of the test loop.

The sealing surfaces on the flange faces are flash copper plated,
and then nickel plated, to promote good wetting by the sealing alloy.l

Because of its geometry, this Joint must be installed in a vertical
run of pipe.

The test flanges were made of Inconel. A cast silver seal was used
in one flange assembly, while an alloy of T2% silver and 28% copper was
used in the other flange assembly.

An assembly of the flange is shown in Fig. 8.

The molten salt mixture was circulated by means of an LFB-type
centrifugel pump. During tests 1 and 2, on the freeze flanges, two
straight sections of the loop, each about nine feet long, were used
ag resistance heaters; A heavy current was passed through the tubing
sections. Other sections of the loop were heated with calrod or clam
shell heaters. The entire loop was preheated, prior to filling with
salt,

Tests 3 and 4 on the freeze flanges were conducted in a new
location where resistance heating was not available, and the entire
loop and pump were heated by means of calrod and clam shell heaters.

A sump tank, connected to the point of lowest elevation in the
loop, was used to fill and drain the loop of molten salt., The LFB
pump, installed at the highest point in the loop also served as a surge
tank., The pump was supplied with an oil lubricating system. A helium
supply was connected to the loop for initial purging of air before
heating. It was also used ﬁo pressurize the sump for filling the loop
with molten salt. The various components.at the pump end of the loop
are shown in Fig. 10 and are identified as follows: (1) LFB pump,

(2) Pump motor and clutch, (3) Salt sump, (4) Water cooled oil storage
tank, (5) Lubricating oil pumps, (6) Helium supply regulators, (7) Helium
bubbler, (8) Helium pressure gauges, (9) Lubricating oil flowmeter.

Salt flow in the loop was controlled by a variable speed magnetic-
type clutch and induction motor. V-belts connected the motor and clutch

to the LFB pump.

All components of the loop in contact with the molten salt were
fabricated of Inconel,

The loop design was similar to a "standard" design established
in the Experimental Engineering Department for their corrosion testing
program. The entire loop, including the pump, was mounted on a test
stand, also of "standard" design, made of Unistrut. The stand was
mounted on wheels for easy transport between various construction
stations; such as the weld shop and X-ray room.

All welds in contact with the molten salt were given a dye check
and X-ray examination according to departmental specifications for
critical welds. The Inconel tubing used in the loop had received a
thorough dye check inspection prior to construction of the loop.

Twenty thermocouples were spot welded to the loop tubing and pump,
per Dwg. No., SK-CKM-1623. Additional thermocouples were attached to
the flanges,

Precautions were taken during construction to use clean tubing
and parts, and especlally to avoid contamination of the inside of the

tubing and pump.

4,0 Test Procedure
bl Fresze Flange Jolnt
Two sets of flanges were asgsenmbled with seal rings prior Lo in-
gtallation in the loop. Each flangs assembly was then laak tested using
a helium leak dstector. To leak test, the tubing from one zud of a Tlangs
assambly was plugged and the other end comnected to a vacuum pump., A plastic
bag was then placed arcund the flange assembly and kept {1lled with helium
during the leak test, Hellum leak rate tests wers madse on both flange as-
semblies prior to installation in the loop for Tests 3 and 4, This work
was dore by the Instrument Department and is described in detail in thair
grep@rt No, 58-1-20, Both flangs assemblies wers then walded into one and
of the loop as shown in Fige. 2 avd 9.
Helium was circulated through the loop bafore prseheating, to ra-
move air. A helium pressure was malntalned on the loop and pump duriag
heating and filling,
Clean fluoride salt mixture was then travsferred to the sump tank.
When the temperature of all parts of the loop reached 1300°F, helium
pressure was applied to the sump tank to force the salt into the loop,
The pump wasg opsrated at a low speed durdng the filling opsration, The
loop was vented through the pump belium iclet, as the salt displaced the
helium. Salt circulation was chtalned a few minutes labter, when the pump

speed was incrsassed to 2500 rpm to produce about 2 gpm flow., A halium
w 21 e

blanket was maintained at 2 to 5 psig on the salt surface in the pump during
testing operations.

Tha heaters wera then adjusted to obtain 1300°F on all parts of the
loop. During the loop filling operation, cooling air was circulaeted in
the air channels built into the freeze flanges. A small alr flow of ap-
proximately 15 ¢fh was necessary to keep the seal ring area cool.

The loop was filled rapldly to insure establishment of frozen seals
batwesn the flange faces before the molten salt could raise the temperature
of the flanges.

After a period of isothermal operation to make certain there was no
salt leak, the thermal cycle testing waes begun. Temperatures of the salt
were measured by means of thermccouples located on the loop tubing at the
inlet to each flange assembly., Temperature measurements were teken at
varions points on each flange assembly.

The salt flow was maintained at a steady rate of 2 gpm. The pump
speed was checked periodically with a Strobotac and the flow in gpm cbtained
from a pump calibration chart.

A schematic diagram of the Inconel lcop during Tests 1 and 2 is shown
in Fig, 11. During these tests, temperatures were measured at the points
indicated in Fig, 12, Fluoride salt, Fuel No. 107, was circulated in the
loop durlng the first test. The salt temperature was cycled 50 times
betwaen 1150°F and 1300°F, and then the locp was operated isothermally for
SQveralidays at 1300°F. The average cycle time was 44 minutes. A cycle is
defined as a hemperature variation from 1300 to 1150°F and back to 1300°F.

During the second test, In which fluoride salt, Fuel No. 30, was used,

ths temperature variation of the salt wasg from 1300 to 1500°F and back to

1300°F. The number of cycles was reduced to 30 and the average cycle time
was 29 minutes.

After Tests 1 and 2, the {lange assemblies were disassembled and
reassembled to demeonstrate ease and gpeed of handling, A motion picture
film was taken of these cperations. The time required for these operations
ig listed in Table 1,

Both of the flange assemblies were removed from the loop before
starting on theinext test., Additional machining work was performed on
the flange faces to produce a better finish on the seal ring grooves.

A schematic diagram of the Inconel loop for Tests 3 and 4 is shown
in Fig. 13. Flu@ride_salt, Fuel No. 30, was used in these tests., The
temperaturss were measursd at the points indicated in Fig. 14%. The salt
flow rate was, agaln, 2 gpm.

During Test No. 3 the salt temperature was cycled 50 times between
1100°F and 1300°F. The average cycle time was 60 minutes. During Test
No. 4 the temperature variation of the salt was from 1100 to 1300°F and
back to 1100°F; the number of cycles was 25, and the average cycle time
was 02 minutes.

After the thermal cycling tests, both flangs assemblies were removed
from the loop for leak testing. Both assemblies were disassembled and
one flange assembly was reassembled using a new copper seal ring. This

assembly was again leak tested.

4.2 Cast Seal Joint
Twe sets of flanges were assembled with metal inserts prior to in-

flange assemblies were then welded into one end of the loop in the location
shown in Fig, 13.

A special furnace was placed around each cast seal flange for melt-
ing the metel inserts and to provide heat during loop operation. The loop
and flangss wers fill@d with helium prior to heating. The sssembly with
the silver insert was raised to 1830 - 1975°F ard held at this temperature
for cas hour to insure complete fusion of the silver., The melting point
of silver is 1760°F. The other asssmbly was trested in the same fashion,
excapt that the temperature was raised to 1570° - 1670°F. The melting point
of the copper-silver alloy is 1435°F.

The loop and flanges were then filled with helium at a pressure of ap-
proximately 25 psig to check for leakage through the cast metal seals. The
pressure did not drop after several nours, snd the flanges gave no indication
of sany leakags when checked with a scap solution coated over the flange joint
and around the bolts.

The loop was then placed in operation for thermal cycle testing as de-
seribed in Section 4.1,

During these tests, temperatures were measursd at the points indicated
in Pig. 7. Fluorids salt, Fuel No. 30, was circulated in the loop during
both tests on the cast seal flange. During Test Wo. 1, the salt temperaturs
was cycled 5C times between 1300 and 1100°F. The averags cycle time was
60 minutes, During Test No. 2, the salt temperaturs variation wes from
1100°F to 1300°F and back to 1100°F. The number of cycles wag 25 and the
averags cycle time was 62 minutes. Tests 1 and 2 on the cast zsal flanges
wers run simultanecusly with Tests 3 and 4 on the freeze flanges.

After the cycling tests, both flange assemblies were sszparated using

the special Turnmaces to melt the cast seals Juring the pariting operation,
- 29

Stainless steel rods were tack welded to the flanges to pull them apart,
while the seals were in the molten state, A diagram of this apparatus
is shown in Fig. 15. |

The top halves of each of the two flange assemblies were thoroughly
cleanad by placing them in a hydrogen furnace at 1900°F for about two
hours. The bottom halves of both assemblies were glven a superficial
cleaning using a brush and a vacuum cleaner. The bottom halves of the
flanges represent those parts of the mechanlical Joints which could not be
removed from a reactor system for cleaning and would have to be cleaned re-
motely.

Both flange assemblies were then reassembled using spring-loaded tie
rods to apply the necessary force to push the flange halves together. A
diagram of this apparatus is shown in Fig. 16. The special furnaces were
used arcund each assembly to melt the cast seals during the reassembly
operation,

Both flange assemblies were removed from the loop and sectioned for
metallurgical examination. This work was done by the Metallurgy Division,

(See Appendix 5 for thelr report.)

4.3 Inderted Seal Joint

Twe sets of flanges were assembled with metal gaskets priocr to in-
stallation 1n the locop. Four "C" clamps were used on each flange assembly.
The clamps were each tightened with a torque of 80 - 90 foot pounds. The
load oﬁ each gasket was approximately 12,000 pounds per inch of gasket
clrcumference, Fach flange assembly was leak tested using a helium leak
detector. DBoth assemblies were then welded into one end of the loop as

shown in Figs. 9 and 17.

The loop was then placed in operation for thermal cycle testing as de-
scribed in Section 4,1, During Test No. 1 temperatures were measured at
the points indicated in Fig. 5. Fluoride salt, Fuel No. 30, was circulated
in the loop at a flow rate of 2 gpm. The salt temperature was cycled 50
times between 1100°F and 130C°F. The average cycle time was 60 minutes,

Both flange assemblles were removed .from the loop after Test No, 1 for
leak testing. OSubsequently, the assemblies were separated and reassembled
with pew gaskets., The flanges were then re-installed in the loop for Test
No, 2.

During this test, temperatures were measured at the peoints indicated in
Fig. 18. The salt temperature was cycled between 1100 and 13%00°F. The number
of cycles was S0 and the average cycle time was 61 minutes.

Again, the flanges were removed from the loop for leak testing and dis-
agsembly. ©One of the flange assemblies was reassembled with a new gasket and

then leak tesbed.

Discussion of Results
5.1 Freeze FPlange Jeint

The maximam and minimm temperatures of various locations on the fleanges
during'tharmal cycling are listed for Tests 1 and 2 in Table 2; for Tests 3
and 4 in Table 3.

Examination of Tables 2 and 3 will show that the greatest temperature
variation, at any one point in the flanges, occurs at the flange hub near the
1loop tubing, For example, thermocouple No., 21, Table No. 2, Test No. 1,
varied from 862 to 1018°F. Thus, the greatest temperature variation, at
this polnt during cycling, was 156°F. The smallest variation occurs at
the periphery of the flanges as indicatea, in one case, by thermocouple

by this thermocouple were 245 and QSO“F,'respectivaly, Thus, the greatest
temperature variation, at this point during thermal cycling, was 35°F,

The lov maximum temperature, and the slight varlations in tempera-
ture encountered in the region of theifastenings and seal ring during
thermal cycling, are desirable features of the freegze flange Jjoint.

The meximum radial temperature difference between the outside and
inside diameters of the flange, during the same test, was 738°F. This
figure is €he differsnce between thermoccouples No. 21 and No, 24, taken
at their maximum values. The corresponding salt temperature was 1300°F.
The maximum such temperature difference cbtained for any of the tests was
817°F.

The above examples are typlcal of the freeze flange Qpera'bione Com-
plete data for all tests is presented in graphical form. The points of
large and small temperature variation can be seen to follow the above
descriphion. Graphs showing temperatures of the flanges throughout the
periods of thermal cycling are inmcluded in Appendix 2.

Gas leakage rates for Tests No. 1 and 2 were not satisfactory. This
was athributed to defects introduced during the initial fabrication of the
flanges. Some welding was performed on the flanges after all of the
machining had been completed, which caused a slight warping. In addition,
the finish on the seal ring grooves was not fine enough., These defects
were remedied by additional machining. Subsequent leakage rates were sat-
isfactory.

Gas leakage rates of the Joints used in Tests 3 and 4 are listed in
Table 4, Oune leak rate was obtained on each flange before Test 3 and after

Test 4. As can be seen from the data, there was an appreciable increase in

the leak rate after testing. A third leak rate was obtained on one of the
flange assemblies following the cycling tests, after disassembly and re-
agsembly with a new copper seal ring. This leak rate was 2.0 x 10~8
cc/second and successfully met the speclfication listed in Section 3.1,
paragraph (f).

The flange assemblies were heated or conled between room temperature
and the operating temperature of 1300°F at least eight times in the prepa-
ration for thermal cycling tests. The rate of cooling and heating was at
least 250°F per hour.

Both flanges operated successfully in that there was no indication
of sal% leakage, the gas leakage rates were satisfactory, and there was
no indication of any cracks due to thermal stresses. (See Section 3.1),

A memorandum concerning the metallurgical examination for stress cracks
is included in Appendix 6.

Oxidation of the copper seal rings was negligible. The rings had the
same bright appearance after testing as they did originally. The Inconel
Tlanges showed no noticeable salt corrosion., The flanges and seal rings
are shown after the completion of Test No. & in Pigs. 19 and 20.

The formation of the salt seal is shown in Fig. 21 after thermal
cyciing tests and disassembly. Parts are identified as follows: (1) Frozen
salt seal, (2) Lebyrinth insert ring, (3) Groove for seal ring. Both flanges
are shown after disassembly in Fig. 22 and various parts identified as
follows: (1) Cooling air lines, (2) Resistance heater lugs, (3) Calrod
heater leads, (4) Thermocouple leads, (5) Clam shell heaters, (6) Copper

The same flange is shown after removal of the salt seal in Fig. 23.

The time for cleaning both flanges was not more than 5 minutes.

The time necessary for the handling operations of disassembly and
reassembly is indicated in Table 1. Ease and speed of handling were de-
monst?ated, indicating that the freeze flange Joint is potentially suited
to remote manipulation, Other tests are in progress to demonstirate remote

handling of this type of Jjoint.

5.2 Cast Seal Joint

The maximum and minimm temperature of various locations on the
flanges during thermal cycling are listed, for Tests 1 and 2, in Table 5.

Examination of Table 5 shows that the temperature variation, during
thermal cycling, is nearly the same for a thermocouple located in a well
near the cast seal as it is for a thermocouple located at the flange peri-
phery near the flange bolts. For example, thermocouple No. 25, near a
bolt, varied from 1177°F to 1287°F during Test No. 1. This is a variation
during thermal cycling of 110°F. During the same test thermocouple No. 23,
in a well near the cast seal, varied from 1157°F to 1296°F, a variation of
139°F.

The temperature variation, during thermal cycling, in the region of
the bolts is about three tiﬁes fhat obtained in the case of the freeze
flanges (See Section 5.1). In addition, the bolts were about 1000°F higher
in temperature than the clamps on the freeze flanges.

- The radial temperature difference, however, between the outside and
inside diameter of the fl;ﬁges is small compared to the freeze flanges,
causing less thermal stress.

The above examples are typical of the cast seal flange operation. Com-~
plete data for all tests are included in graphical form. Graphs showing
temperature of the flanges throughout the periods of thermal cycling are

included in Appendix 3, There was no indication of any salt leakage during

(3) The salt and flange temperatures before the 18t cycle and was from 10° to L45°
cycling were 1300°F lower than the minimum temperatures
listed in table above,
* (See Fig. 7 for thermocouple location) The salt and flange temperatures before

(See Fig. 13 for diagram of Inconel loop) cycling were 1100°F,
any of the testing. There was ne indication of gae leakage with the lcop
and flangss under 25 psig of helium, followlrng the initial fusion of the

ring lnserts. The pressure indiecation on the loop did net decrease over

a pericd of several hours. There was ne indication of gas leskage using

3 goap solution on the flanges.

The steps and time periods ipvolved in disassembly of these flanges
are listed in Table 6. Difficulty was encountered in step (5), the re-
moval of four stainless sbesl bolts and nuts from each Tlange. Fach nut
had t¢ be heated to & rad heat, and a wrench used with considerable force.
In step (9), separation of the flanges while hot, it was found that the
flanges could not be pulled apart with a 25 to 50 pound force on the ex-
tension rods comnected tu the upper flacge half. It was necessary to open
the heater box arcund each flange and use a cc¢ld chisel to separate the
Tlange halves, Since all of the disassembly operations would be ac-
complished remotely in a reactor system, it is clear that the cast seal
Jolnts, as tested, were not satisfactory in this respect. A comparison
may be made in the time necessary for disassembly of the Freeze Flange
Joint and Cast Seal Joint by referring to the data in Tables 1 and 6,

The steps involved in reessembly of both flaanges are shown in Table 6,
Steps l; 2, 3 and 6 would be accomplished remotely in sn actual reactor
ingtallation. Afier reassembly, it was found that both assemblies leaked
helium badly at the interfaces of the flange halves, ILeaks were detected
with a scap solubtion while the flanges were under 15 psig of helium pres-
sure,

Photographs taken after disassembly of the flanges show that the
flanges and sealing alloys wers badly oxidized. Fig. 2% shows the flange

with the copper-silver alloy seal; Fig. 25 the flange with the silver seal.,

Metallurglical examination confirmed that damage was done to the metal

seals during the heating cpesrations. Ses Appendix 3,

The maximm and minimun temperatures of varlous locstions on the
Tlaoges during thermal cycling are listed, for Test No. 1 in Table T; for
Test Mo, 2 in Table 8,

Exsmination of Takle 8 sbows that the temperature variation, during
thermal oyeling, for s tharmoccuple locsted in a well near the metal gasket
18 about ons-half that of a thermocouple located at the hub of the flange
naasr the l@@p‘twbinga

For exsmpls, thermocouple No. 30, near the gasket, varised from 960°F
to 1065°F, & variation during cysling of 105°F. Thermocouple No. 27 varied
from 1090°F to 13L0°F, a variation during cyeling of 220°F,

Tow tewperature variation, during thermal cycling in the reglon of the
clamps ;is about thrze times thai obiained in the case of the freeze flange
(S2e Section 5.1). This fact@rg togethear with the high temperature in the
reglon of the fastenings, means that the clamps oo the Indented Seal Flange
would have & greater tendency to looses than those on the freeze flange.

Ths radial tamperature difference, howsver, betwsen the oubslde and
inzide diamater of the flsrges is about 1/5 that of the freeze flauges
cauging less thermal sirsss,

The abuve esxamples are typlcal of the indented seal flange operation,
Complete data for all téatg ars pressnted in graphical form. Graphs show-

bafore and after each thermsl cycling test. A new gaskel was then installed
in each flange agsembly, followed by another leak test. None of the four
gaskets, each of a different material, leaked salt. The flangs with the
copper gasket leaked helium following the thermal cycling in Test No, 1
however, the leak sealed itself before the flangs ssgenbly was removed

from the loop for checking with a helium leak detector, The copper gasketb
was badly oxidized as well, as shown in Fig. 26.

The flange with the annealed Armco iron gasket passed gas laakage
tests satisfactorily. This flange and gaskét 1s shown after test in Fig.
27. The iron gasket, after removal from the flangs, is shown in Fig. 28,
The outer edge of the gasket was oxidized and therafore congldersed un-
suitable,

As can be seen from photographs Nos. 26 and 27, a ring of frozen salt
nad formed between the flange faces., This frozen seal sxtended from the
loop tubing diameter of 0.410 inches to an cutside diamstsr of approxi-
mately 1-1/4 inches. For subsequent teste a heater was placed arcund the
outside of each flange assembly to insure that the salt bebwsen the flangs
faces would be in the molten state during testing.

Tha flange with the annealed nickel "A" gasket leaked gas arfter thermal
cycling testing; however, this was caused by loosening of ove of the "Q"
clamps, which held the flange halves togethero This flavg: and gasket is
gshown after testing in Fig. 29.

The flange with the nickel plated Armca iron gasket passed gas leakage
tests satisfactorlly. It 1s shown after testing in Fig. 30. No oxidization
of the gaskel was apparent.

With the exception of the annealed Armco ircn gasket , removal of the

gaskets from the flanges was difficult, It was necessary to cut the gaskets

free of the flanges in a lathe.
Of the four gaskets tested, the nickel plated and annealed Armco
iron gasket proved most satisfactory. The Inconel flanges showed no sign
of damage from ecorrosion or mechanical defects. A more suitable method
of clamping is in order, to insure a tight seal during the various tempera-

ture chenges.

Future Tests

The same freeze flange Jjoint and indented seal joint, described in
Section 3 of this report, are now under test with molten sodium in an
Inconel loop. An annealed copper seal ring is being used in the freeze
flange. A nickel plated, annealed Armco iron gasket is being used in in-
dented seal flange. The tests are similar to those described above. Both
flange assemblies are shown installed at one end of the Inconel loop in
Fig. 31.

A larger size freeze flange jolnt has been fabricated. It is shown
assembled in Fig. 32. The flange is shown open with the copper seal ring
in place in Fig. 33. The principle of operation is identical to the small
size flange tested and described sbove, Provision has been made on the
ring seal for monitoring the gas leak rate during operation. Two such
flanges have been fabricated for testing with molten salt in a loop,
shown schematically in Fig. 34. The welding necks on the flanges will
match a Y-inch, schedule 4O pipe. An unusual feature of the large flange
is the use of a special clamp, made in two sections, which-holds the flanges
around their entire circumference. The clamp is shown in the asaembly’photo-
graph, Fig. 32. Holes were placed in the webs to reducerheat conduction
from the salt to the seal ring area. A metal screen will be inserted in

the space between the flange faces to reduce the hold-up volume of salt;

PRELIMINARY MECHANTCAL JOINT SPECIFICATION

ocope

 

This specification selsz forth the requirements for a mechanical joint which

may he used 1o a radioactive high temperature molten salt system,

Service Regulraments

 

This unit shall contaln radisactive molten salts at tempersturss up to 1300°F,
and shall contaln gaseous fission products bstween normal ambisnt and 1300°F,
In addition, the unit sball be adaptable to remots assembly, disassembly and

leak checking.

Materials of Construction

 

The materials of construction ghall be compatible with the process fluids and

in no way centribute contaminants which might reduce the life of the system

or in any way raduce the efficlency of the nuclear or thermodynawmic processes.
Furthermors, it would be highly desirabls to eliminete materials of construction

which would result in high levels of induced activity.

Mechanical Design

 

A. Bize
The unit shall be adaptsble to plpe sizee rangiog from 1/2" IPS +o 12" TIPS,
B. Orientation
It is highly desirable that the unit be adaptable to piping runs of random
orientation; however, a single application to vertical or horizontal ruus
shall be considered acceptable.
C. Holdup Volume
When the procegs fluid is drained from the system, the residual msterial
if any, shall not be more than 2 ce., Any material held up must bs re-

tained for inventory purposes and shall bs handled in a mannsr that rse-
- 69 -

duces the spread of contamination.

Alignment Tolerance

The unit shall be capable of functioning to meet the requirements of this
spacification with a piping centerline mismatch of # i/32" snd/or angularity
misalignment between piping runs of * 1/2°, These specifications are to

be met without stressing the joining piping runs beyond thelr design

imit.

Flow Resistance

The run of piping containing the unlt shall not have any appreciable in-
crease in flow resistance as compared to & similar section of regular pipe.
Strength

The unit shall behave the same ag the parent plping under time, tempera-
turs, and stress and shall not require preferential application,

Remote Servicing

All special tools, fixtures, and leak checklng equipment shall be con-
eidered as part of the unit package, and practical x@m@te demonstration of
such apparatus will be required.

General

Because of the remoteness of the appllcation, it is desirable that auxiliary

service requirements be kept to an absolute minimum.

Leak Tightness

A,

Gas Leskage
1., Gas leaks shall be determined by means of a mass spectrometer leak

7

detector having a sensitivity of 1 x 10 ' cc/sec. Ths system
sensitlivity shall be established before each test by calibration

of thes detector with a standard leak.
<

- TO =

No indication of gas leaksge sball be permitted. This leakages specifi-
cation shall apply during and after SO temperature cycles betwean
ambient and 1200°F. The rate of temperature changs shall not be less
than 100°F per hour.

Report on Metallurgical Exsmination of the Cast Seal Flanges
~ 10l -

SCLIDIFIED METAL SEAL DEVELOPMENT

G. M. Slaughter

In order to provide information to the dssigners of the solidified metal
geal, several 0.252-1n,-dia tensile bars wars prepered from cast silver,
These ware tested at room temperature, 1200°F, and 1M00°F. The test re-
sults indicate that the room-temperature mechanical propsrtiss are aboutb
the sams as the publishked data; i.e,, 20,000 psi tensile, 8,000 psi yield,
and 50% elongation inm l-in, At 1200°F, the teunsile strength dropped to
2,400 psi and the yield strength to 1,900 psi, with a corresponding
elongation of 6 - 10%. At 1400°F, the tensile strength was 1,500 psi,
the yield strength wag 1,00 psi, and the slongation was 10%.

The two flanges that were operated in test at ¥-12 were received for
metallographic examination, A half-section of the silver flange is shown
in Flg. 35 {¥-26029), while a half-section of the silver-copper flange is
shown in Fig. 36 (¥-26103). The exsmination indicated that moderate oxi-
dation of the components during opening and closing the flange had occurred,
thereby impeding wetting of the base metal. The flange utilizing the silver-
copper alloy appesred to be less subject to this condition than that con-
taining the pure silver, probably because of the lower tempsraturss re
gqulred to remelt it during opening. A pbotomicrograph of a typleal inter-
face between the silver-copper and the Inconel base metal is shown in Fig,

INTER-COMPANY CORRESPONDENCE

UNION CARBIDE NUCLEAR COMPANY
A Division of Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation

To: A. Taboada Plant: 9201-3, ¥-12
Copies to: W. B. McDonald Date: May 26, 1958
A. S, Olson
RSC Files (¥C) Subject: Examinaticn of Freeze Flange

This freeze flange had operated through several thermal cycles in test.

Information regarding possible cracking was desired.

Three sections were taken through the center hole to explore all the areas
likely to exhibit cracks. One section included a welded-on web and s
longitudinal section through the center hole. Another section was taken
roughly 45° away longitudinally through the hole and a third in trarsverse
cross sectior through the counter-sunk center of the flange. It was in this

area that cracking was felt to most likely occur.

None of the sections examined showed any cracks.

Nos. 5 and 4 and cast seal flange tests Nog, 1 and 2. For the indentaed
seal flange tests, the cast seal Tlaunges were cut out of tha loop and ra-
placed by lengbhs of 1/2 inch Inconel tubing., The freeze flanges were cub

out of the loop and the indented seal flanges inpstalled in their placs,)
