CORROSION AND MASS TRANSFER CHARACTERISTICS OF NaBF,—NaF (92-8 mole %)
IN HASTELLOY N |

J. W. Koger

ABSTRACT

A series of corrosion experiments in thermal convection
and pump loops designed to test the compatibility of fused
NaBF,—8 mole % NaF with Hastelloy N has shown the extreme
effect of impurities on the system mass transfer.” The diffi-

" culty in keeping the melt sufficiently pure was also illus-
trated. Kinetic considerations showed that the mass transfer
process is controlled either by solid-state diffusion or by
the solution rate, depending on the amount of impurities
allowed to enter the salt. The mass transfer behavior is
very similar to that for the Cr-UF,4 corrosion reaction
(material removal in the hot section and deposition in the
cold section), the differences being that alloy constituents
other than chromium participate in the process and that the
reaction rates are different. Because of these differences,
the effective diffusion rate controlling the hot leg attack
is larger than that obtained in typical diffusion experi-

" ments for chromium in Hastelloy N.

Titanium-modified Hastelloy N with less chromium and
iron shows a greater resistance to attack in a fluoroborate
salt with 500 ppm oxide impurity than does standard
Hastelloy N. Its corrosion rate is doubled by increasing
the oxide concentration to 1500 ppm. Average corrosion
rates were low for all systems tested.

 

-~ : ~ INTRODUCTION.

‘The successful development and operation of the molten salt reactor

‘experiment (MSRE) have led to the present program for_ development of a

molten salt breeder reactor (MSBR) In the MSRE the heat transferred
from the fuel salt to the coolant salt was. rejected to an air-cooled
radiator. In the MSER a secondary‘coolant ‘will be required to remove

heat fromltne fuel in the primary heat exchanger and transport this

- heat to supercritical steam at quite low temperatures.

 
 

This secondary coolant should have low viscosity and density and
high heat capacity and thermal conductivity to permit use of écceptable
heat exchangers, coolant pumps, and steam generators. The melting point
must be low enough to meet the heat transfer temperature requirements,
and the vapor pressure must be low at the temperature of‘operation. The
salt must also be easily remelted, with‘no precipitation of high-melting

compounds during cboling. The coolant must be commercially available in

high purity, and the price should not be prohibitive. In nuclear systems

the coolant must be stable under the radiation that it encounters. We
_'also must consider the result of accidental mixing of the coolant fluid
and steam and select a codlant in which the effects of this mixing will
_bé minimiied. Last but not least,-the coolant must be compétible,ﬁith
the container materials .of the system. _ | _

It now appears that the best choice for the MSBR secondary coolant -

is the eutectic mixture of 8 mole % NaF in NaBF4, with a meltihg point! of
385°C (725°F) as shown in Fig. 1. The salt is quite inexpensive

with gaseous BFj3, it was rapidly attacked by traces of moistnre to give

an' appreciable rate just above 200°C. 'Underrthe conditions of those
experiments, BF3; did not appreciably attack a wide variety of metals or

alloys examined at temperatures up to 200°C.

All metal components of the MSRE in contact with molten salt were

made of Hastelloy’ N (formerly called INOR-8). Two decades of corrosion.

testingt’_15 and e)cperiencew""19 with-the MSRE have demonstrated the
excellent compatibility of‘Hastelloy N and graphite with fluoride salts
containing LiF, BeF,, UF,, and Tth. Hastelloy N, perhaps with some
modification of composition, is quite likely to be the primary contain-
ment material for MSBR. Thus, it was of great interest to the molten

salt program to determine ‘the compatibility of the fluoroborate salt

mixture with Hastelloy N and related alloys. Of Special interest is
Vtemperature-gradient mass transfer, which must always be considered

" where corrosion in a heat exchanger is possible.l Corrosion and deposi—

tion processes ‘in flowing nonisothermal systems are interdependent and

:each exerts considerable influence over the extent ‘and characteristics

of the other. Therefore,'a performance analysis of a nonisothermal
system must consider these processes as complementary and equal in sig—
nificance to the overall system behavior. This paper is an up-to-date,

open-ended report on these studies.

 

Hastelloy N is the trade name of Cabot Corporation for a nickel—

base alloy containing 16% Mo, 7% Cr, 5% Fe, and 0.057% C

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

Equipment

In corrosion‘studies the thermal convection loop represents an
intermediate stage of sophistication and complexity between simple
capsule tests and a fulléscale engineering pump loop experiment. It
is particularly suited to small-scale tests that involve temperature_
gradient mass transfer. The flow of the liquid is caused by its varia-
tion in density with temperature. The development of a modified thermal
convection loop has permitted important strides in ohtaining basic'cOrro—
sion information; The thermal convection loop used in this work and
shown in Fig. 2 permits unrestricted access to specimens and salt at
any time without significantly disturbing 1oop operation or introducing'
air contamination. Access is provided by'twin ball valve arrangements
atop both the hot and cold legs of the loops. The molten salt sampling

r'device illustrated in Fig. 3 was used in our thermal loops and can also

A forced convection loop was also used to evaluate the fluoroborate
salt mixture and will be described later.

Salt Preparation

The salt for these tests was processed by the Fluoride Processing
Group of the Reactor Chemistry Division. Very pure (> 99.9%7) starting
materials were evacuated to about 380 torr, heated to 150°C in a vessel

-lined with nickel, and then held for about 15 hr under these qonditions.

If the rise in pressure was not excessive (indicating no volatile impur-

ities), the salt was heated to 500°C while still'Under vacuum and agitated

- for a few hours with bubbling helium. It was then transferred_to the £fill

vessel and from it forced into the loops with‘helium pressure. In the

.case of the pumped loop the salt was transferred initially into a dump

tank and then into the loop tubing.-

The hot portion of each thermal convection loop was heated by sets

of clamshell heaters, with the input power controlled by silicon controlled

rectifiers (SCR units) and-the'temperature‘controlled by a Leeds and

Northrup Speedomax H series 60 type CAT controller.. The loop tempera-

'tures were measured by Chromel-P vs Alumel thermocouples spot welded to

the out31de of the tubing, covered first by quartz tape and then by stain—
less steel shim stock.

‘Each loop was degreased with ethyl alcohol heated to 150°C under

- vacuum to remove moisture, and leak checked before filllng with salt.

All lines from the fill tamk to the loop that were exposed to the fluo-
roborate salt were of the same material as the loop and were cleaned and
tested in the same manner as the loop. All temporary line connections
were made with stainless steel compression fittings. ‘

- Each loop was filled by heating it, the salt pot, and all connecting
lines to at least 530°C and applying helium pressure to the salt pot to

force the salt into the loop. Air was continuously blown on the freeze

valves leading to the dump and flush tanks to provide a positive salt

seal. Tubular electric heaters controlled by variable autotransformers

_heated the cold—leg portions. Once the loop was filled the heaters were

turned off, “and the proper temperature difference was obtained by remov1ng

some insulation to. :expose portions of the cold leg to ambient air.

The -first charge of salt was circulated under a small temperature

difference (20°C) for>24_hr and dumped. This flush removed surface

oxides and-other possible impurities. The loops were then refilled with
new salt and put into operation. A helium cover gas_under_slight posi-

tive pressure (about 5 psig) was maintained over the salt in the loops

~ during operation.

transfer rates in both legs, We may also analyze specimens and loop
tubing with a microprobe to determine composition gradients, x-ray
fluorescence to determine the surface composition, and spectrochemistry
to determine overall composition. Standard metallographic examination
is also helpful to determine the extent of attack or void formation in

the hot leg or the amount of deposit in the cold leg.

" OPERATION AND RESULTS

. The results of tests of the fluoroborate salt mixture in two ther-

mal convection loops and in a ‘series of capsule tests have already been"

 reported.?%s2} In addition, four other thermal convection‘loops and one

pumped“loop‘have'been'operated. Thése latter tests are described below,

above conditions was 7 ft/min. Loop NCL-13 contained standard Hastelloy N

- specimens, while loop NCL-14 had titanium-modified Hastelloy N suspended

in the salt stream. The compositions of these alloys are given in

- Table 2. The modified alloy is being‘considered because of its superior

‘mechanical properties.under radiation’'at elevated temperature.

The weight changes measured for the,specimens‘in NCL-13 and NCL—14
showed an increase in mass transfer rate between 3500 and 4300 hr of '
egpcsute to the salt (Fig. 5). This was accompanied by perturbations in
salt composition. Analyses of the circulating salts from these loops
showed that the oxide content increased to above 2000 ppm (from initially
less than 1000 ppm), and the nickel and molybdenum contents exceeded
100 ppm (from below 25 ppm). Also, the chromium and iron contents
increased "nbrmally"-with time, as shown in Fig. 6.

After 4700 hr of operation, the helium gas regulator that provided -
the ovérpressurerto NCL-13 failed and caused a surge of gas to the loop,
stopping the salt flow. Circulation of the salt could'notfbe resumed
until a vacuum was pulled on the loop, which we believe removed a gas
pocket. Shortly after circulation was restored, an electrical short,
which eventually burned out a heater, occurred and heated the bottom of
the hot 1eg to 870°C (1606°F). This disrupted the flow and caused a
loss of BF3; from the loop, which changed the salt COmposition and plugged
all.thelgas 1ines. The loop was drained of alllsqlt,'and plugged lines
were replaced or unplugged. Other necessary repairs to the loop were
made, and the loop was filled with new salt. The loop was then designafed
as NCL-13A. | I

After new fluoroborate salt was added to loop NCL-13A, circulation
could not be achieved. We coﬁcluded that previous‘overheatiﬂggbf the
loop had caused BF3 to evolve and had made the salt much richer in NaF.
This in turn caused the higher melting NaF to segregate in the loop. To
bring the composition back to normal, we added BF; gas to the melt through
the surge tank. The initial amounts of gas were dissolved in the salt,
and additions continued until a slight overpressure built up over the

salt. (No devices were available to measure the amount of BF; gas added.)

- Circulation of the salt was then attemptéd and was successful. Only a

small temperature difference (55°C) was obtained at first. Further addi-
tions of BF3 as before lowered the temperature of the salt in the cold

leg and increased the temperaturefdifference to about 125°C. Since more

~BF3 did not cause immediate changes and did not appear to dissolve in

the salt, the additions of gés were stopped. . The loop has since operated

satisfactorily.

Loops NCL-13A and NCL-14 have now operated for two and three years,

fréspectively. Figure 7 gives the weight changes of specimens at various

 temperatures as functions of operating time. The overall corrosion rates

at the maximum temperature, 605°C, are 0.5 and 0,7 mil/year for loops
NCL-13A and NCL-14, respectively. The attack is general, and actual .

measurements of specimeﬂs show changes in thickness agreeihg with those
_calculated from weight changes. We will now discuss the circumstances

‘that have affected the mass transfer conditions.

The air leaks in loops NCL-13A and NCL-14 occurred at various mechan-
ical joints in the system, such éé ball valves, level probes,'and pressure
gages, all located in the cover gas spaée above the circulating salt. We
had gaiﬁed extensive experience with similar mechanical joints before
testing fluoroborate salt mixtures and had encountered_no_leakage problems.
Therefore, the frequency of leaks in.theée two fluoroborate loops strongly
suggests that the BFg atmosphere in these.tests'has déteriorated our

mechanical seals. We are currently investigating the chemical nature of

‘the BF3 to determine ény posSible contaminants which might have caused

such deterioration. Despite the known broblems'ofﬁair leakage, these
loops have opefated for over two years with the fluoroborate‘salt, and

the overall corrosion rate is within acceptable limits.

We also used loop NCL-14 to determine the corrosion properties. of
pure Cr, Fe, Mo, and Nickel 280 (commercially pure nickel with Al,03
added as a grain refiner) at 600°C‘iﬁ”the‘fluoroborate mixture., As a
consequence of the air leaks discussed above, the oxide éontent of the
salt in loop NCL-14 was at an!abnormaliy high 1éve1 and indicated fairly
strongly oxidizing condifions. We.initialiyrexamined the pure metal
spécimens after a 234-hr exposure. On removal, we found thét'the chro-
mium and iron specimens had completely'disintegfated. 'The molybdenum
specimen showed no weight change, and the nickel specimen showed a
slight weight gain. The cHromium'and iron specimens’were-replaced, and
a second experiment was conducted for 23 hr. Again, the molybdenum
specimen did not change weight, and the nickel specimen showed a slight
weight gain. Very little of the chromium specimen remained, aﬁd the
weight loss of the iron specimen was 40 mg/cm2 (70_ﬁils/year). Close
‘examination of the chromium épecimen showed it to be coated with~é black
reaction layer about 0.015 in. thick. Laser spectroscopy of the outer
surface of the black material showed iron and'bqron as major conStituents
and sodium and chromium as minor constituents. However, x-ray diffrac-
tion of the bulk coating showed it to be over 90% NaBF,. This blgck
coating has been observed on Hastelloy N specimens eprsed to impure
NaBF4,—8 mole % NaF in the past'22~but in these cases it was too thin or
too adherent to remove and identify. | ‘

Attack of Hastelloy N by impure fluoroborate salt tends to be non-
Selectlve, that is, all components of Hastelloy N suffer oxidation, and
surfaées of the alloy appear to recede uniformly. However, in this
experiment with pure metals, only the chromium and iron were noticeably
attacked, the chromium more than iron. We cbnclude, therefore, that
the pure chromium and iron specimens in this system inhibited the attack
of the nickel and molybdenum specimens., The inhibition apparently is
much less when chromium and iron are present as alloying additions in
Hastelloy N, presumably because their chemical activity in the alloy.is
too low or the rate at which. they can enter the salt is too slow,

being limited by solid-state,diffusion\in.the alloj. When the

oxidation pbtential of the salt is reduced however,,as would be the
case in a purer fluoroborate salt attack of Hastelloy N becomes more
: selective, and the buffering effect of chromium may become more impor--
'tant. In loop tests of nickel-molybdenum alloys containing Fe, Nb, or

- W, DeVan observed23 that the. concentration of these elements in FLINAKZ“

salt was lowered by the presence of chromium in the alloy. These obser-

- vations suggest that the incorporation of an active metal such as chro-

‘mium would effectively inhibit attack in a Hastelloy N—fluoroborate

circuit. _ ‘

Figure 8 shows optical'and scanning electron micrographs of speci-
mens from the hot and cold leg of NCL-13. These specimens were exposed
to NaBF,—8 mole % NaF for 4180 hr at 580 and 476°C. The hot-leg specimen
lost -3.3 mg/cm?, and the cold-leg specimen_gained-3.2 mg/em?. The sur-
face of the hot-leg specimen, as seen in Fig. 8 (left) has been attacked

nonuniformly and is heavily contoured. Figure 8'(right) shows that the
;,cold-leg specimen is coated with a discontinuous depoSit which is essen-

5tia11y analyzed as Hastelloy N slightly enriched in nickel and molybdenum.

“The dumped salt from NCL-13 was chemically analyzed and the results
are given in Table 3. The Cr, Fe, Ni Mo, O, and H»0 contents of the

‘salt all showed large increases., Increases in the nickel and molybdenum

_content of the salt often indicate the onset of stronger oxidizing con-

ditions, usually due torincreased water or oxygen content. Thus.the

most obvious explanation of the-composition changes'and'increased weight

changes was contamination by water, which produced HF, which-in turn

‘ attacked all the constituents of the COntainer material. This was sub-

stantiated by the discovery of a faulty helium line common to both loops.

This line admitted air.

Loop NCL—14 initially operated about 3500 hr with the oxide content
in the salt between 500 and 1000 ppm. During that period the weight

, changes were small and- predictable as a function of time. Wet air then

camewin contact with the salt through the defective gas line, andrthe

water content and corrosion rate increased dramatically. During the

~next 5000 hr the oxide content of the salt decreased, and the corrosion

rate again decreased as a function of time. The maximum rate of weight
loss:during this 5000-hr period was about 1.5 X 1072 mg cm™ 2 hr™!

(0.65 mil/year). This corrosion rate is double that measured during the
earlier operating period. , : | '

. The concentration ofﬁimpurities in the salt in loop NCL-14 is given
as a'fonction of.operating'time in Fig. 9. The.second.change_in corrosion
rate, at some tine between 11,000 and 13,000 hr, was due to a.leaking
standpipe ball valve. .Ihis last intake offimpnrities illustrates a con-

tinuing problem of detection (other than the obvious after-the-fact

increase of impurities and corrosion rate), since the loop overpressure
did not change significantly. Apparently moisture from the air effuses
into the relatively moisture-free athoSPhere,of'the'loop (equalization =~

of partialfpressure) without the need for a'gradient-in overall pressure.

In this last corrosion rate increase period the analyzed oxide content of

the salt increased from 1300 to 4500 ppm.l The_ball valve was repaired,

and the loop continued to Operate.‘

As we have shown, abrupt increases in the slope of the weight change

curves (increased rates of gain and loss) indicated changes in the oxida-

tion potential of the salt, which were caused by inanvertent air leaks

into the system.r These slope changes were accompanied by increases in

:Cr,rNi Fe, and Mo contents in the salt, which would indicate general
'attack of the alloy.' Under conditions where.external impurities did not

perature is 607°C with a temperature difference of 107°C. ThlS experiment
has run for over 10 000 hr and is continuing in order to provide informa-
tion on the immediate and long—range corrosion of the system after steam
injection. The loop was operated for 1050 hr, the specimens were removed

the cover gas began to increase, thus indicating that Nno more steam was
soluble in the salt. Figure 10 shows thelweight changes and temperatures
for the specimens in NCL-17. As usual, the changes depend on temperature,
and the rates decrease mith time after an initialrapid rate. The corro-
sion rate appears to have stabilized, and nd”plugging conditions have
been noted. Figure 11 shows the specimens from the loop 424 hr after

Loop NCL-20

In loop NCL-20, d%ﬁgiructed of standar&&ﬁgstelloy N with removable
specimens in each leg, the fluoroborate coolant salt has circulated for
12,000 hr. The selt used was especially pure (see Table 6). The loop
is being eperated at temperatufe conditions very near those proposed for
the meximum_(681°c) and minimum (387°C) ealt-metal temperature (primary
heat exchanger and steam generetor,.respectively) of the MSBR secondary
circuit. Fofced air eoolihg (as opposed to ambient air cooling used on
other thermal—convection'leops) is used on the lower half of the cold |
leg,,and the practical opefating temperatures obtained were 687°C maxi-
mum and about 437°C minimum: a temperature difference of 250°C. This
difference is thought to be the largest obtained at ORNL in a molten-salt
thermal-convection loop, and the maximum temperature is the highest for
fluoroborate salt in a loop. Table 6 gives the corrosion results for
this experiment. The corrosion rates are the lowest yet attained with a
fluoroborate mixture and confirm the importance of salt purity on com-
patibility with structurel_materials.‘ The low concentrations of chromium
and oxide in the salt are'eiso indicative'of low corrosion rates.
Figure 14 shows weight changes of the specimens as functions of time and

temperature.

FCL-1 Pump Loop

The MSR-FCL-1 forced-circulation loop operated-for over 11,000 hr
(7 runs) to test the compatibility of standard Haételloy N with NaBF,—8 mole %
'NaF coolant salt at temperatures and flow rates similar to those that
‘existed in the MSRE coolant circuit. Salt velocity in the 1/2-in.-0D
X 0.042-in,-wall Hastelloy N loop waé nominally 10 fps and was limited by
the use of an available pump. The salt in the loop was heated by electri-
cal resistance and cooled by a finned, air-cooled heat exchanger. A
- schematic of the 100p is given in Fig. 15. Figure 16 is a typical tem-
perature profile of the system; this profile was based on a computer plot
of the temperature information from the test loop and on heat transfer
- calculations that estimaterthe'inner wall temperatures. The maximum and
minimum salf temperatures of the loop are 588 and 510°C. Hastelloy N
corrosion test specimens were exposed to the circuiating salt at three
temperatures, 510,.555, and 588°C. A typical set of specimens is shown
schematically in Fig. 17. One of the main drawbacks to this 1oop was
that the salt had to be drained from the loop and the loop tubing had to

After 659 hr of shakedown operation under various conditions and
the initial 2082 hr of operation at design conditions a bearing failed
in the LFB centrifugal pump. The pump rotary element was removed, and
a new bearing was installed. To take advaﬁtage'of this unscheduled
“downtime, portions of the loop piping and the corrosion specimens were:
removed for metallographic ekamination and weight change measureﬁents.-
This first operating period was designated run 1. It was then decided:
that the loop would be shut down each 2000 hr for pump-bearing replace-
ment and specimen.examination. , |

Installation and Testing of Cold Finger During Run 3

During run 3 a cold-finger corrosion product trap, shown in Fig. 26

d2% in sodium fluoroborate

and similar in design to one previously use
test loop PKP-1, was inserted into theﬁsalt in the pump bowl in an attempt
to induce preferential deposition of corrosion products from the salt |
circulating in the loop. Such deposition had been observed on the cold
finger in loop PKP-1. Gross.deposition'is always possible in a temperature-
gradient system, and we feel that this eold—fingefrdevice is a likely com?
bonent to prevent this problem. o

The cold finger-ueed in MSR-FCL-1 is a closed-end nickel cylinder,

1 3/4 in. long X 3/8 in. OD, with a 0.070-in.-thick wall. It is cooled

by an argon—water mixture injected into it and then discharged to the

atmosphere. The metal wall temperature is measured and recorded by twe
0.020-in.-0D sheathed, ungrounded Chromel vs Alumel thermoeouples inserted
in two 1-1n.—deep axial holes (0.023 in. diam) in the 0. 070—1n.-thick wall
of the cold finger.

" Eight tests were ‘made in ﬁhich'the-cold fingerlwas inserted into
the salt in the pump bowl of the loop and cooled to temperatures ranging
from 493 to '140°C, = The duration of the tests ranged from 1 5 to 5.3 hr.
The temperature of the salt in the pump bowl was 510° C.

In contrast to the deposits of material containing Nagchs, which
d?® on a cold'finger'in°PKP-1'loop"at metal wall tempera-
tures of 400, 460, and 477°C no significant deposit of any kind was
seen on the cold finger tests. in loop MSR-FCL-l Even in the three

tests where indicated wall temperatures were below the salt liquidus

‘temperature (385°C), the surface of the cold finger was essentially

clean, as visually obser#ed'ﬁhen‘it7Was withdrawn into a sight glass.

0ccasionally, small patches (1/8 to 1/4 in. across) of white material

‘estimated to be a few mils thick were seen on the surface.

The cold finger was then installed in the PKP- 1 fluoroborate loop
-n an attempt to duplicate the previous cold—finger test results of

that loop. The chromium concentration of the fluoroborate salt in loop

PKP-1 1is about 500 ppm,'while that in MSR-FCL-1 is about 250 ppm. Two
“tests were run in which the indicated cold-finger wall temperature was

" about 150°C (salt'temperature'in"the'pump bowl was 548°C). Test times

were 1-and 4.5 hr. No deposition on the cold'fingerewas seen after

withdrawal into a sight glass. Tests at higher temperatures were not

made because of temperature control difficulties with the cold finger.\

Since the cold finger"preVious1y used in the PKP-1 loop.contained

. grooves on the outside Surface, the lower half of the surface of the

MSR-FCL-1 cold finger was scored with file marks about 0 010 in. deep,
and a third test run ‘at about 150°C lasting 671/2 hr was made in the

 PKP-1 loop.  ‘In this run a deposit was obtained. Generally, the entire

:surface'of the'éold”finger was covered'With‘a'white deposit,NWith‘an

overlay of bright green’ ‘material on the lower half of the cold finger.

The cold finger was allowed to ‘stand overnight under a helium atmosphere,

and by this time the deposit,had begun to separate from the cold-finger
surface. While the cold finger was moved for photographing, the entire

weight was 1.63 g, of which_l;26 g was mostly green material (complete

Subsequent operation of the cold finger at the same condltions in |

'loop MSR-FCL-1 did not produce a deposit. On the basis of these tests

we concluded that a wetting problem exists with the salt-and that a

tried various designs to improve adherence of the deposit to the .cold.

drawal from the pump bowl.

Run 4

.After run 4 when the pump had been removed, we found approx1mately

50 g of intermixed white and green material on the pump liner above the

liquid level  Analysis of'a small portion of this material showed about

equal amounts of NaF and NaBFq, with 4300 ppm Cr, which we assume to be
in the form of Na3CrF5. We do not know the conditions that caused the
dep091t10n of the corrosion product in the pump liner. |

Speclmens in the coldest part of the system gained weight during

the first three runs‘and then lost a small amount of weight during run‘4.

Thickness measurements of these specimens disclosed that the upstream

end had reduced in thickness compared with the middle and downstream
end. Specimens at other locations in the loop (555 or 588 C) showed
similar but smaller thickness variations. Figure 27 shows a specimen
at 588°C after run 4 and clearly illustrates the‘heavier attack at the |
upstream end. Changes in specimen thickness‘are‘Summarized,in Table 9,

and theylare-quite consistent with the changes calculatedffrom_weight

probe analysis of.this surface showed a large amount of iron and a little
more nickel than usual. This situation existed for a distance of 0.5 mil,
after which the conéentrations of both elements approached that of the
matrix. The average deposit is only 0.2 mil thick; thus, it appears that
portions of the deposit have diffused in. Prior evidence in deposit

study had disclosed similar fiﬁdings.

Run. 5

Run 5 was terminated after 422 hr of operation at design conditions
‘when the pump bearings failed. This failurg allowed the pump impeller
to contact the impeller houéing, abrading the impeller. Metal particles
from the impeller were seen in the salt left in the pump bowl after
dumping.' Acéordingly, the pump was removed from the loop, andlat the
same time we removed'the corrosion test specimen assemblies. This
allowed ﬁs to clean the loop piping by flushing withideminerélized water.
A total of 3.31 g of Hastglloy N particles.was recovered from thesloop.v
The loop_Was dried bj air purging, and the corrosion specimen assemblies
and pump were reinstalled. A ni¢ke1 filter with 40-um pores was'also
installéd in the dump tank line to filter any metal particles from the
salt being returned to the loop. | | | _

During the scheduled loop shutdown at the end of run 4, we had
enlarged the access port in the pump bowl from 1/2- t6.3/4-in._diam
 

 

43

(maximum size possible’in'the pump bowl) to provide more flexibility in
the design and operation of cold-finger devices. With the enlarged
access port we were able to insert a 5/8-in.-0D.cold finger with circum-
ferential grooves that had been previously used in another circulating
fluoroborate loop (PKP-1) and on which significant deposits of salt con-
taining Na3;CrF¢ had ‘been obtained.

Several tests were made during run 5 with this cold finger at tem-
peratures between 150 and 420°C. The cold.finger was inserted below the
liquid surface in the pump bowl'for:periods of 5 to 6 hr for each test.
The salt temperature_in the'pump bowl was approximately 516°C. Small
deposits with a light-green'color'(indication of corrosion product
Na3CrFg) were-occasionally seen on the cold finger when it was withdrawn
into the sight glass above therpump'bowl. Howeuer, such deposits usually
dropped off immediately. Apparently any slight vibration is enough to

knock most of the deposited material loose before the cold finger can be

 .pulled all the way out of the pump bowl.

The weight changes of Hastelloy N specimens in loop MSR-FCL~1l are
compared in Table 7 for each of five test runs. The corrosion rate |
decreased steadily over the first four runs and, at the conclusion of
run 4 “had dropped to 0.3 mil/hr at the point of maximum temperature
(588°C). However, the corrosion rate during run 5 was higher than in
.any of the preceding runs.

Although the increased rate of attack during run 5 is undoubtedly
assoclated with operating difficulties encountered during the run, we
have not pinpointed the specific causes. Increased corrosion is normally
accompanied by an increase in impurities in the salt; however, we did
not see any significant impurity changes during run 5. Because of the
nature of the last pump-bearing failure, we were not able to take a salt
' sample from the loop'before shutdown=in.our normal manner.‘ Thus a sample
'was_taken from the dump tank after the loop had been shut down. However,
because of dilution-there'was no assurance that.the'sample was represen-
tative of the salt that had circulated in the loop. '

large amounts of mass~transfer had occurred.

Run 6

The sixth run was abruptly terminated after 1241 hr, when oil from

‘a broken pump cooling oil line ignited on contact with the pump bowl and
‘adjacent piping. We'extinguished the fire and turned off all loop
‘heaters, which allowed the salt to freeze in the loop piping. Figure 30

shows the pump bowl and pump with no apparent damage after the fire.
The material in the beaker is salt and corrosion products left in the
pump bowl. |

We replaced the electrical wiring, thermocouples, and service

piping necessary to melt the salt in the loop piping and transfer it to
- the drain tank. This was the first time that we had attempted to melt

salt in the entire loop circuit,:although salt had been melted in the
cooling'cdil without difficulty on several occasions. Normally when

the loop is placed in standby condition, the salt circulation is stopped,

the main loop heaters are turned off, and sufficient heat is supplied
to the loop to maintain the loop circuit above the salt liquidus tem-
perature, 385°C. During the attempted melting, the main loop piping
(1/2~in.-0D x 0.042-in.~wall Hastelloy N) ruptured at a point_near the
U-bend in the loop and adjacent to one of the metallurgical specimen
holders, as shown in Fig. 31. After the rupture, we froze the salt in
the loop as quickly as possible by turning off all loop heaters. How-
ever,,approximately 77 g salt was lost from the loop. Before the rupture
the salt'in the bowl and cooling coil section of the main loop had been
melted without difficulty,.the main loop piping had‘reached'temperatﬁres
varying between 371 and 482°C around the loop circuit, and the drain

line temperatures were above 426°C.

In reviewing the loop melting procedure to determine the cause of
the rupture, we concluded that uneven thicknesses of thermal insulation
caused considerable variation in the temperatures. In partiéular, the
temperatures under the clamshell emergency heaters (where‘the thermal
insulation was about 1 in. thick, compared to about 2 in. on the remainder
of the tubing) were about '80°C below temperatures in the more heavily
insulated sections of tubing. Thus, the sélt in the ruptured area melted
but was not able-toiexpand‘properly because of frozen salt plugs under
the emergency'heaters. Another problem was the difficulty in controlling
‘the rate .of heatup of the main loop by resistance heating. Even though
'thé lowest setting on the‘ioop heater was used, we still had to turn off
the heater supply power for short periods to maintain temperature control.

We removed -the metallurgical Specimen'éssembly and ruptured section

of tube and replaced it with new tubing. Figure 32 shows the ruptured

section of tubing. Measurements of the outside diameter of the remaining
loop tubing were made énd'compared with the original outside diameter to

determine if excessive permanent strain had occurred at other locatioms.

48

Generally all measurements were in the range of 0.500 to 0.505 in., as
compared to the original diameter of 0.500 in.

The tubing that surrounded the specimens was removed after run 6
(11,371 hr) and examined by both optical metallography and scanning
electron microscopy. Figure 33 shows the tubing exposed to'nalt at 588 _
‘and 555°C. 1In the nptical micrograph of Fig. 33(a) the surface roughening
(some salt is still in place) can be seen, and the attack at the grain‘
.boundaries is noted. In the scanning electron micrograph we can see the
~delineation of the grains. Figure 33(b) shows much less attack at 555°C.
Figure 34 shows the tubing ddwnstream of the cooler in the coldest posi-
‘tion (510°C) of therloop. The deposit is easily seen in the optical
-m1crograph and is seen in the scanning mlcrograph to be in the form of
nodules. The upper portion of Fig. 34(c) shows a side view of the nodu-
'-lar deposits. ‘

After the oil fire that ended run 6 and the subsequent rupture of
the tubing during the attempt to melt the salt from the loop, the corro-
sion specimens-were‘removed, weighed, and examined. Surprisingly, weight
was lost by all specimens. The weight loss rates found for specimens
exposed to the salt at 588 and 555°C were (assnming uniform losses)labout
1.9 and 0.5 mils/year, respectively, for the 1240 hr of run 6. The corro-
sion rate ratio for these specimens (severnl timeS'greater>1oss at 588°C
‘than at 555°C) was fairly consistent with past findings."However, in
earlier runs, specimens at 510°C had gained weight. .For tnis time period
specimens at this-temperatnre 1evelnlost-ma£efia1 at the rate of 1.9_mils/year,
the same as for specimens at 588°C. This weight loss anomaly and the
overall higher weight losses are attributed to the problems encountered
during this run and probably atteét to a local high temperature in the

analysis showed small increases in chromium, iron, and nickel contents,

During run 7 while repairs were .under way on the loop high-temperature

\protective instrumentation, an operating error resulted in a portion of

the loop tubing- being heated above 1100°C.‘ This caused one failure of
the loop tubing adjacent to one of the electrical power input lugs
(see Fig. 31) and also about 12 in. downstream. Part of the salt in the

‘loop'(about 2 1iters) was discharged into the 1oop secondary containment.

‘ Temperatures were immediately reduced and the facility was shut down.

At about 1100°C the strength of Hastelloy N is very low, and the salt
vapor pressure approaches 1000 psi. The salt boiled locally, and over-

heating could have reduced'the tube strength until rupture occurred.

Local melting of the tubing was also efidenced. At the time of failure

the loop had accumulated 10,335 hr of operation at design conditions
(101 br during run 7). The tube failure is shown in Fig. 35.

Following the rupture'of the_loop-tubing that ended run 7, the
corrosion test specimens were again removed for weighing and metallurgi-
cal examination. The specimens adjacent to the ruptured area (hottest
section under normal conditions, 588°C) were badly warped and partially
fusedzto the tube wall. Thus, only metallographic analysis was possible.
The specimens'in the intermediate zone (555°C) appeared to be unharmed.

The average weight loss for these specimens was 1.3 mg/cm? in the 101 hr

“of run 7. Expected 1oss for these specimens in 100 hr would be approxi-
,mately 0.1 mg/cm . Thus, if we attribute the balance of the corrosion

to just the period of the temperature excursion (to about 1000° C), the loss

rate was 1.2 mg/cm® in 2.5 min or 10,000 mils/year (10 in. /year).

Weight losses were also found for the specimens downstream of the

. cooler. Although the specimens were adjacent, one specimen lost

0.3 mg/cm2 and the other 3.0 mg/cm®. Again the severity-of the over-
heating was'evident. Certainly a large part of these losses may be
attributed to moisture contamination of the salt and air oxidation
after the loop rupture. Nonetheless, the corrosion rate was quite high.

The loop is now being modernized and prepared for additional service.

" SALT CHEMISTRY -

With the realization that the fluoroborate salt is easily contami-
nated with oxygen and water-type impurities and that corrosion increases

with the amount of these'impurities;‘we“have attempted, in close coopera~-

~tion with R. F. Apple and A. S. Meyer, of the Analytical Chemistry
-'Division, to purify the fluoroborate in a manner that could be adapted

to a‘large system.

and HF (purified with fluorine) was pASSed through the fluoroborate at
454°C. A schematic of the process is given in Fig. 36. The gas mixture
was passed for 15 hr into a Hastelléy N vessel containing the impure
(about~2000'ppm H,0) fluoroborate salt (2.7 kg) at 480°C. 'The'exit gas

to be minimal. Further work is planned using a nickel vessel to elimi-

nate corrosion products resulting from the reaction of HF with Hastelloy N.

Analytical Chemistry

Over the last few years, we have been-concerned‘dver.the behavior
of water in molten fluoride salts. Water in these salts has implications
for both corrosion and tritium removal. In corrosion work, we have long
- recognized the need for analyses that would allow us to distinguish B
between water and (1) compounds that contain H ions, (2) compounds
which contain 0%~ ions, and (3) HF (highly corrosive). In the past, a
complementary indication-of mass transfer (besides weight changes and
metal analysis of the salt) was the analysis for'HZO,ahd 0, in the salt.
On the basis of our tritium injection experiment?’ and work in the
Analytical Chemistry and Reactor Chemistry Divisions, we now feel that
the results of the water determinations included many other constituents
~of the salts, including oxides. Thus, a resulﬁ_indicating a large amount
of water really only showed a corresponding amount of oxide. The lack
~of waterviﬁ the salt is completely reasonable because all the hydfogen
in impurity coﬁpcunds that enter the salt would eventually cause oxida-
tion of the metal wall and would in turn be reduced to hydrogen gas,
. which would diffuse out of the loop (the corrosion equations will be
discussed later). However, increased mass transfer (weight losses and
‘gains by specimens) by virtue of water impurity‘is still accompanied b&
an increase in the oxide content of the salt;' Thus; the oxide content

is still somewhat indicative of the mass transfer of the loop system.
DISCUSSION

“Theory

Metal corrosion by salt mixtures consists of oxidation of metal

constituents to their fluorides, which are soluble in the melt and hence

do not form a protective film.. This electrochemical-type attack is

»

therefore limited only by the’thermodynamic potential for the oxidation
reaction and is selective, removing the least noble constituent, which
- _ in the case of Hastelloy N is chromium. Possible corrosion reactions

involving impurities in the melt may be written as

2HF + Cr = H, + CrF,,.
 NiF, + Cr < Ni + CrF,,
Fer + Cr = Ni + CrF,. .

Although the reaction product is written as Cer, the actual species in
_the melt is unknown. Chromium(II) is possibly unstable in the fluoroborate
melt, since the only corrosion product isolated and identified is Naachs.

in question.

- In an isothermalmsystem, immediately after immersion,io the fused
salt system and before thermodjnamic;equilibrium-has been fully estab- - : ”
lished, the electrode potential of the metal has a much higher electro-
negative value than the redox potential of the surrounding medium. : As ' ~
a result, reduction of the oxidizer commences.which takes place along .
with the corrosion of the metal. As the corrosion products accumulate
the metal's electrode'potential shifts in the positive direction, whereas
the redox potential moves toward the'negative.side; Equilibrium occurs.
when therpotentials are eqoel. Since we are dealing with corrosion in
a nonisothermal system (i. e.,-a heat exchanger), the mechanism of
interest to us is temperature-gradient mass transfer. A schematic ofi
this process is glven in Fig. 37. In a loop ‘that contains salt with
UF, and no corrosion products, ‘all points of the loop initially expe-

" rience a loss of chromium by the reaction

2UF, + Cr = CrF2 + 2UFj3.

As the corrosion—product concentration in the salt is”increeseo, eqoi--‘-
librium with respect to the corrosion reaction is eventually reaehed at
the point of lowest temperature of the system. At regions of higher
temperature, a driving force for the corrosion reaction stiil exists.
Thus, the corrosion-product concentration will continue to increase and
the equilibrium temperature will begin to increase from the coldest
temperature. At this stage, chromium is returned to the walls of the
coldest point of the system. The rise in oorrosion-product conoentra-
tion in the circuleting salt continues until the amount of chromium
returning to the malls exactly balances the amount of chromium entering
the system in the hot-leg regions in the same interval.‘ Under these
conditions, the two positions of the loop at equilibrium with the salt,
‘which are termed the "balance points," do not shift measurably with time.
Thus, a quasi—steadf—state situatiom is eventually achieved, whereby
chromium is transported at very low rates and under conditions of a ?
fixed chromium surface concentration at any given loop position. At

this point the chromium removal.is controlled by the solid-stete diffu~ s
sion rate of chromium in Hastelloy N. Table 11 illustrates the small . | \N-j

There should'be-Veryrlittie corrosion of Hastelloy N by pure molten

mass transfer. This was also iilustratedkiniNCL-l7; where_steam was
added. The corrosion reactions in the sodium fluoroborate salt mixture
have not been well established but can be expected to be reasonably

represented by the following equations:'

"LTheinext‘result'is'thatfwater reacts with sodium fluoroboraterto
produce hydrogen fluoride and exide ions or an oxygen—containing complex
" 'in the salt. The hydrogen fluoride reacts with the constituents of
_Hastelloy N to bring'metal ions into solution in the 'salt and to release
hydrogen. It is not known if the oxide in solution can. corrode Hastelloy N,
but oxygen in air can react*w1th Hastelloy N to produce metal oxides.
' These metal oxides dissolve in the melt to form metal ions and oxide ions
in solution. Metal dions in solution in the salt react with and diSplace
less noble constituents of the Hastelloy N. Highly oxidizing conditions
(presence of HF) can bring all the constituents into, solution. As the
salt becomes less oxidizing the more noble'metals in solution react with
1ess noble alloy constituents until only chromium ions are present in
the salt in important. quantlties. This movement of chromium is governed
primarily by the rate of diffusion of chromium in the Hastelloy N.
Assuming that HgO (or HF) causes the mass transfer in sodium fluoro-
“borate and on the basis that 1 mole of H20 is required to corrode 1 mole
of metal we have calculated the amount of water required to cause known
amounts of corrosion on several of our systems (Table 12) For NCL~17
in the 1054-hr operation before steam addition, 41 mg Hgo would have
been required to cause the 137 mg metal removed leaving 75 pPpm ox1de
in the salt. At the end of 10,000 hr- after steam addition 23 g of metal
had:been'removed " This would have required-6.3 g H20 and would have
resulted in 13,800 ppm oxide in the salt. Since we have never measured
| this much oxide in the salt, this material must deposit. The amount
of water required to produce the corrosion seen in NCL~20 is small but
has continued to increase with time. This can mean several things. One,
there is a constant inleakage in our test systems or, two, there are
impurities present in the salt which continually cause corrosion.f‘The
first possibllity is quite plausible because we have seen faulty gas B
regulators, which can leak undetected for quite a long time.' As for the
ﬁseCOnd possibllity, the Fe ¥ concentration in the salt has decreased over
120 ppm, which would result in the removal of only 350 mg of chromium
from the Hastelloy N. This still leaves .about 600‘mg.that=we might

"attribute to water-caused corrosion.

is not controlling (Figs. 38, 39, 40, and 41). Thus the same mass
transfer theory holds for our impurity-controlled reactions. _

retained in the salt is chromium with some iron, both in the form of

Kinetics

such as the corrosion of a solid material by a fused salt occurs as a
sequence of steps. The combined effect of these steps determines the

significantly slower than the others, the—:ate of the entire reaction
is governed by the slowest step.

It is convenient to break up the dissolution process in the hot leg

_ 1nto four separate steps:

1. diffusion of the attacked elements through the matrix of the alloy
to the surface, |

2, migration of the oxidizing species from the salt to the surface,

3. oxidation of the metal to a dissolved fluoride,‘ o

4. migratlon of the oxidized metal to ‘the flowing salt.

In cases where the slow step involves awdiffusion;proceSS‘(volume
diffusinn‘in a selid), the reecfion is tefmed &iffusionecontrolled and
is govefned by the laws of diffusion kinetics.‘ Alternately; if a
boundary-region process‘(solutiqnj constitutes the slow step, .the rate

ofithe,overallsreactien,is_determined-by the kinetics of that process.

The rate of formation of the corrosion product fluoride should be included
in this analysis, but experimental data'relating to its formation and
the effect of impurities are lacking. |

_ If. the diffusion step is rate controlling, then no velocity effect
" would be seen. However, if step 2 was slowest and was controlling, the
process would be velocity dependent. At a certain critical velocity
(possibly even that of the salt inm natural'circulatien loops),.the pathv
for step 2 would become short and step 3 would contrel. Above this
critical velocity, no velocityrdependence would again be seen. Step 4,
1ike step 2, would be‘velocity dependent. Thus, experiﬁents in systems
with different salt velocities could help to determine the rate-controlling
mechanism.‘ |

In this work, we will consider the possibilities of solid-state

diffusion and solution control.

in the process since the material which is to be removed is already at

fthe surface. Thus, step 2, 3, or 4 might be controlling. After the

initial fast portion of the reaction the corrosion rate generally levels

out. At this time, the diffusion of the elements to the surface would _

fcontrol. Thus, the calculated overall rate would appear to be of

mixed control. When a velocity effect 'is noted, .as 1is thought to occur
in MSR-FCL-1, then it can be assumed that enough impurities are controlling
the corrosion reactions to cause solution rate control of the entire
process. | | ',

Although the proposed corrosion mechanisms are usually first considered

for material removal, they may also be used for the deposition in the
 

 

 

70

- cold leg of the system. The temperature dependence is reversed, the
largest deposition occurs at the,highest temperature, which causes a

| change in sign of the activation energy. Table 14 gives the experimental
values of Q and b for the systems which gained weight. The kinetic
constants of’one group,‘titanium-modified alloy and fluoroborate salt with
1500 ppm oxide, corresponds to solid~state diffusion control but the -

value of the others are in mixed agreement.

:Diffusion Calculations

Weight change rate constants based on diffusion control were cal~
culated for loops NCL-13 and NCL-14 after 2500 hr with the following

equation
Aw, = C J&Dt/mw, T > 520 * 15°C,
oss
where |
C = concentration of Fe + Cr in Hastelloy N, g/cm?,
D = diffusion coefficient, cm?/sec,
t = time, sec.,

By using the weight changes and the combined iron and chromium
concentration for the loop specimens, almost identical D values were
-obtained for the standard and modified Hastelloy N. This is quite
significant, since the iron content of titaniumemodified Hastelloy N
is negligible. Thus D, or in reality a rate constant Kl’ is independent
of the concentration of chromium, iron, and other diffusing species.

The weight change, however, is quite sensitive to the total concentration
of the migrating elements. Confirmation of this hypothesis is evident

when K1 is compared with D, 1in Hastelloy N 31»32 ~ For loops NCL~13 and

It would be expected, if the solid-state diffusion mechanism
controlled, that the calculated rates of Fig. 43 based on diffusion
- coefficients would be identical to the-experimental rates. However,
results of only the titanium-modified Hastelloy N —fuel salt system
coincided with thercalculated values. Incidentally, fuel salts were
used in the earlier experiments'that showed_that the rate was controlled
by the diffusion coefficient of chromium in the alloy.’® Thus, we have
shown that another mechanism besides chromium solid-state diffusion is
controlling the process for several of the metal-salt systems investigated
~here.

‘The weight losses of the specimens exposed to the fluoroborate salt
_ and the value calculated for 600°C and 4000 hr are compared in Table 15.
It is noted that the experimental losses are greater than those calculated.
As has been discussed earlier, the impurities in the fluoroborate salt
appear to be very important because of the formation_of‘HF, which is
strongly oxidizing and will.attack all the constituents of the Hastelloy N
alloys. However, in the salt'containing 500 ppm oxide impurity the
titanium-modified alloy showed smaller weight losses than the standard
alloy, again because of its lack of iron. 1In the salt with 1500 PpPM oxide
impurity more HF was available for attack and the weight losses
were higher, since measurable amounts of nickel and molybdenum were
removed from the alloy. An increase in nickel and molybdenum concentrations
r-is often noted in the salt analyses under these conditions. The amount
of attack is approximately doubled. Because of the large amounts of
nickel and molybdenum in-the alloys very little differences in the weight
losses of the standard and titaniumrmodified.alloys will be noted when
‘large amounts of HF are available for attack. It is also believed that
this HF attack is responsible for the mixed kinetics noted earlier.

With reSpect-to'the deposition process, it is obvious that the

calculated rate includes only the weight changes that occur from the

‘deposition on the surface. The amount of the diffusion into the metal

is not measured. However, during the straight-line portion of deposition
with ‘time, on which the kinetic calculations are based it was theorized
that the rate at which the metal deposited is the same as the rate at
which it diffuses into the container wall. In time the weight gains

would continue, the amount of deposited material on the surface would

hremain essentially constant, and a chromium gradient would appear in
- the colder sections. All experimental findings do support these

'.suppositions.

' The kinetic calculations for the weight—gain portion of the mass -

transfer show a mixed control between solid-state diffusion and. solution

rate. Analogous to the behavior in the hot leg, in the cold leg the .
- weight gains could be first solution-rate controlled and later, as the

'process slows down, be controlled by the diffusion. Thus, the overall

"effect would be mixed control As theorized earlier ‘it still appears
ﬁ‘that the action in the cold leg controls the mass transfer process for

‘,‘the entire system.

of interest.“_The'proportionality constant may be relafed_to the diffusion
coefficient of the metal in the.liquid if diffusion is the controlling
.step or may be related to another factor concerning,Some process:occurring

at the_inteffaee if the rate of solution is controlling. However, many

additional ‘models have been required to explain all the experimental
findings.v~The most ticklish problems involve the possible effect of
oxygen on.the solubility of certain metals in”liqmid metals, the velocity
effect; end the downstream effect. ‘Similar problems eXist‘in'the fused
fluoride'selt systems. Inrthe'salt systems, we can make the.general
statement that the corrosion rate in fuel salts is a functiom of the

chromium and iron contents of the alloy. In the fluoroborate salts, the

 rate is a function of the alloy composition and the impurity level of the

salt. The proportionality constant for_bbth cases is a function of

temperature amd can be found experimentally. As in liquid metal systems,

the rate controlling mechanisms are not entirely clear cut but are-

functions of many variables.

- Although the'corrosion ef these systems has been widely diseussed,

ié should be pointed out that the weight loss ‘rates are quite low.
SUMMARY
Our data on mass transfer in the fluoroborate sait mixture points
out that impurities such as water and.oxygen strongly affect theffluoride

oxidation ﬁotential of this salt. However, we do not yet completely

know the chemical forms takem by these impurities upon entering the salt.

Corrosion rates show a marked increase following an air or steam leak

into the fluoroborate salt. Once the leak has been detected and corrected,
the'corrosien rete dfbps shafply. Analyses of tﬁe salt shows aﬁ increase
in oxide level as the corrosion fate'incfeases; the explanation for this
behavior is that moisture reacts with the salt to produce HF and comprnds
(oxides and hydroxides) that analyze as exides_by thexpresent techniques.
The HF causes rapid oxidation of the containment material and is used up
in the.proeess. The compounds that ensiyze as water and oiygen remain

but have only a minor effect on cott6sioh rate. Kinetic eomsiderations

 showed that the mass transfer process is between solid-state diffusion

control and solution control, probably depending on the amount of

impurities allowed to enter the salt. The mass transfer behavior is very

similar to that seen for the chromium-UF, corrosion reaction, the

difference being that other alloy constituents (beside chromium)
participate in the process and.the,reaction rates are different. We have

also shown the difficulty.in keeping the fluoroborate salt mixture free-

. of moisture-type impurities but feel that this can be done by exercising

sufficient care.

Except for certain periods of the fluoroborate tests, the overall

‘corrosion rates have been relatively small, .Thermal-convection loop

. NCL-14 has operated successfully for over two years and the pump loop

MSR-FCL-1 nearly one_year with the fluoroborate mixture. Comparison of
the rates experienced by NCL-13A, NCL-14, and MSR-FCL-1, all circulating
the sodium fluoroborate-mixture,'indicates a velocity effect on the mass
transfer (Table 16). We believe that the effect of velocity on corrosion
in this system is a function of declining importance as the purity level
of the salt improves. The impurity effect per se has been discussed in
detail previously. Because of the’importance of the impurities on the
corrosion of Hastelloy N by fluoroborate, efforts have begun on methods
of purifying the salt. Also to be considered are better methods for
analyzing ‘and identifying the impurities. At some purity level, perhaps
200 to 400 PP oxide as analyzed solid-state diffusion of chromium in
the Hastelloy N will likely control corrosion, as it does in the fuel
salts. This is most important, since it suggests that an entire MSBR

of either the one~ or two-fluid variety can be operated with none of the

| main circulating channels suffering more than a few tenths of a mil per

year corrosion attack ‘Experimentalpproof of this is one of;our major

near—term goals.

CONCLUSIONS

The corrosion rate is a function of the. alloy composition and

impurity level of the salt.

Because of the corrosive nature of the BF3 in an impure state and

because it is present in appreciable quantities over the melt, leaks

in mechanical portions of the systems can essily'occur.

Kinetic considerations disclose that the weight change'rates are

controlled by a mixture of solid-state diffusion and solution rate.

The effective diffusion rate that controls the hot-leg attack is

larger than the volume diffusion coefficients obtained in typical

diffusion experiments.

The mass transfer behavior (weight losses in hot leg, weight gains

in cold leg, steady balance points) is very similar to that seen for

the chromium-UF, corrosion reaction.

6. Titanium-modified Hastelloy N with less chromium and iron shows a
greater resistance to attack in a fluoroborate salt with 500 ppm oxide
impurity than standard Hastelloy N.

7. The corrosion rate of titanium-modified Hastelloy N in fluoroborate
salt with 1500 ppm oxide impurity is double that found in salt with

500 ppm oxide.

8. Corrosion rates were relatively low for all systems tested.
