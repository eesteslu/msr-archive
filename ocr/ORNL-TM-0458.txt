SOME CHEMICAL ASPECTS OF MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR SAFETY: (1) DISSOLUTION
OF COOLANT AND FUEL MIXTURES IN H-O, (2) A PORTION OF THE
SYSTEM LiF-BeFo-Ho0 AT 25, 60 AND NEAR 100°C

Ruth Slusher, H. F. McDuffie, and W. L. Marshall
Abstract

In connection with safety aspects of the ORNL Molten-Salt Reactor
Program, the solubilities of MSRE fuel and coolsnt were determined in
Ho0 solution at” 259C and at higher temperatures. In a separate study,
portions of the system LiF-BeFo-Ho0 were investigated et temperatures
of 25, 60 and near 100°C. Under conditions of the experiments, the
results showed that (1) from the MSRE fuel, uranium dissolved to the
extent of at least 0.010 molal--probably due to oxidation of U(IV) to
U(VI)--and (2) IiF and an unidentified salt or salts of ILiF and BeF,
were found to exist in the system IiF-BeFp-HO0.

1. INTRODUCTION

Safety aspects of the ORNL Molten-Salt Reactor Program make it impor-
tant to know the short- and long-term effects of a spill of molten reactor
fuel or of reactor coolant into the water-sand mixture at the bottom of
the containment shell. Since this shell is designed to withstand a maximum
pressure of 5 atmospheres (approximstely equivalent to the vapor pressure
of Hy0 at 150°C), the maximum temperature of interest, when considering
long-term effects, would be 150°C. In this study, solubilities of reactor
coolant (LizBeFy,) and fuel mixture (LiF-BeFp-ZrFy-ThF,-UF), T0-23-5-1-1
mole %) in water have been explored at 259C and at higher temperatures.

In addition, investigations on the solubility of ILiF, and of a compound
of LiF and BeF, of unspecified composition, in aqueous solutions varying
from O to 50 wt % BeF» were carried out at 25, 60 and near 100°C. These
latter studies are of further use in evaluating the behavior of molten-

salt coolant in contact with water.
2. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Solid LigBeF) and MSRE (Molten-Selt Reactor Experiment) fuel mixture
were obtained from the fluoride production facility of the Reactor Cremistry
Division, ORNL.l The LijBeF) contained approximately 2 wt % excess IiF.
Chemically pure LiF was obtained from Foote Mineral Company. A stock
solution of concentrated BeF, was prepared by dissolving & weighed amount
of BeFo solid, obtained from the Beryllium Corporation, in water soluticn.

The mixture was refluxed at a little above 100°C for 24 hr in order to

e

dissolve the BeFp. At lower temperatures the rate of dissolution was
very slow. A radioactive tracer, Be-T7, was added to the stock solution,
and portions of this solution were diluted with water to give a series
of aqueous solutions of decreasing concentrations of BeFo.

All solids were ground to fine powders (in a glove box for the
beryllium-containing solids) and were added separately to flasks contain-
ing water. In some experiments, LiF solid was added to flasks containing
solutions of Bng in H2O. |

The mixtures of MSRE fuel and of coolant were stirred at room temper-
ature and at controlled temperatures up to 90°C. Separate mixtures of
LiF and of LigBeF} in contact with BeFp solutions were rocked at controlied
temperatures of 250 % 0.2° and 60° % 0.3°C and were refluxed at tempera-
- tﬁres a little over 100°C. The latter temperatures were those at which
the solutions bhoiled at atmospheric pressure.

Samples of the solution phases were obtained ai%er:periods of time
varying from 4 hours to 28 days. The concentrations of lithium ﬁere
determined by flame photometry, and fluoride by pyrohydrolysis and sub-
sequent acid-base titration of the distillate.? Zirconium, uranium,
thorium, and beryllium were anaiyzed spectrophotometrically by the pyro-
catechol violet metﬁod, thiocyanate method, thoron procedure, anﬁ the
differential p-nitrdbenzeneazp-orcinol method, respectively. Beryllium
was determined also by counting of radioactive Be-T7 and compariéon of
the number of counts with those from an aliquot portion of a standard

solution containing Be-7. Selected solid phases were separated fram the

solution phases and dried between sheets of filter paper. These solids
were examined by means of a petrographic micr03cope; LiF was identified

through its x-ray diffraction pattern.3

3. DISSOLUTION OF LigBeF, in H20

The concentrations of 1i, Be, and F found in solution, when excess
LijBeF, solid was mixed with H,0 &t 259C, are given in Fig. 1 as a func-
tion of time. Based on the data for lithium and beryllium, it appeared
that equilibrium was attained at least within six days and perhaps sooner.
The changes in the compositions of the solutions (re#ealing a higher
ratio of beryllium to lithium than that in the o:iginal solid) require
the appearance of some solid which is richer in lithium than the starting
material and ﬁhich is presﬁmably IiF. The data suggest that an invariant
point may have been established. DNevertheless, these results are in
contradiétion to the solubilities of LiF and of LipBeFp in BeFp-Hp0 solu-
tions given in the table and in Fig. 5. It is possible thgt, although
equilibrium appeared to have been attained, a relatively inert coating
of a new solid on the surface of the LipBeF, solid may have formed and
prevented‘further'dissolution of Li,BeF,. |

The concentrations of Li, Be, and F found in solution are given in
Fig. 2 as a function of temperature. Included in Fig. 2 are some experi=-
mental values by F. H. PerfECt4 which were oﬁtained Ey analyses of liquid

phases after approximately 24 hours of mixing with solid. Perfect

commented that the results were not entirely satisfactory and may have
been complicated by the appearance of two separate solubility curvege--
one for a hydrated salt LizBeF4-xH20 and one for an anhydrous salt. In
a8 further comment, with reference to a patent,5 it was felt that the
anhydrous salt either dissolved very slowly in cold weter, hed a low
solubility, or had both a low rate of dissolution and low solubility.

In our own experiments, mixtures of solution and LigBeF,, solid were equi-
librated 4 hours to 3 days before taking samples of the solution phases

for analyses. Also included are the data obtained at 25°¢ (from Fig. 1).

4. DISSOLUTTION OF MSRE FUEL MIXTURE

The analytical results from the run with fuel mixture at 25°C as a
function of time are shown in Fig. 3. As with the reactor coolant, equi-
librium appeared to be attained within six dasys. Nevertheless, a
consistent increase in concentration of lithium and uranium was noted.

In this experiment it was presumed that tetravalent uranium from the
solid phases had been converted to the hexavalent state in the solution
phase6 by the action of oxygen from the air, and also that an inert
coating may have hindered- further dissolution of the solid phase.

In Fig. 4 are shown enalytical results fof solution concentrations
of U, Ii, Th, Zr, and Be as a function of temperature. The time of equi-
libration at each temperaiure before sampling was one day. Also included

analytical results from samples taken upon stepwise lowering of the tem-
perature of the solution-solid mixture consistently gave higher values

for the solution concéntrafions of the various components., It is believed
that equilibrium either was not reached on cooling or had never been
reached;

In'view of the appreciable uranium concentration found in solution
under these conditions, it has been recommended that neutron poisons be
present in any water which could mix with the fuel in the event of a
reactor accident.

5. A PORTION OF THE SYSTEM LiF-BeFp-H,0
AT 25, 60 AND NEAR 100°C

Compositions of liquid phases of BeFp and H,O which were rocked or
refluxed at several temperatures in contact separately with LiF and with
LigBeF4 are given in the table. The initial reagents and times of rock-
ing or refluxing are specified; also, some designations of solid phases
are given, In all cases a solidﬂor solids were present. When these data
are plotted as the composition of IiF vs that of BeFy (Fig. 5) and con-
sideration is given to the times of mixing and tempera£ure cycling, then
there appears to be metastability of LiF solid phase in equilibrium with
solutiong gontaining high concentrations of Ber- We believe that the
continuous curves which are drawn on Fig. 5 represent stable equilibria-
V'and the dashed curves show the solvbility of a metastable solid. Deta
which'fall between these two curves represent in-progress changes bet-
ween metastable and stable conditions. The only salt defin;tely identi-
fied by the k—ray diffraction method was LiF. Another salt, proposed

to be some compound of IiF and BeF,, was not identified by optical'

present, other than LiF, could be formed only from LiF and BeF2-Ho0 solu-
tion, it is possible that LisBeF,, in an amorphous, unidentifisble form,
was present. By means of optical petrography, birefringent refraction
lines were observed for the unknown solid.3 Similar lines are observed
for Li,BeF, solid.
