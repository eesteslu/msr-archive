MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR PROGRAM QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT
- SUMMARY

Part 1. Engineering and Component Development

 

1.1 Component Development and Testing

 

Tests of molten-salt-lubricated hydrodynamic bearings continued in
bearing test rigs and in the sump-~type centrifugal pump. Operation of the
type PKP pump, circulating NaX, with a modified Fulton Sylphon bellows
seal, was suspended after 18,834 hr of continuous operation for examina-
tion of the lower seal. The seal was found to be worn and was replaced.
The MF-type pump has circulated molten salt continuously for more than
25,000 hr without maintenance.

The small frozen-lead-sealed centrifugal pump has circulated molten
salt continuously at 1200°F for 16,500 hr.

Molten salt was circulated at 1200°F in the Remote-Maintenance De-
velopment Facility. Following the hot operation the salt was dumped, and
all maintenance operations were carried out remotely. A color motion pic-
ture with sound, demonstrating the remote removal and replacement of all
ma.jor components, was completed.

Twenty-five forced-circulation corrosion loops have been placed in
operation in the MSR corrosion program. Of this number, five INOR-8 loops
and five Inconel loops have now been terminated for metallurgical examina-
tion; the ten loops had operated an average of 10,250 hr each.

A frozen-salt sealed graphite—to-metal joint vas tested. No leakage

: rpast the frozen joint was experlenced although molten salt leaked through
\L;the porous graphite tube at 18 psi pressure.,—

An 1n-pile graphlte-salt capsule was removed from the MIR after 720

?7fi'hr It is awaltlng hot-cell examlnatlon. A second test continues to. op-
‘.;ferate in ‘the MIR and has accumulated more than 1000 hr of exposure at MIR

 The enthalpy of the BUT-14 mixture (LiF-Bng-UF4-ThF4, 67-18,5-0,5-14

mole %) was determined over the temperature range from 100 to 800°C. For

studied to date have been summarized, The thermal conductivity for an

 

INOR-8 rod specimen was experimentally established up to a temperature of
900°F. The results are in reasonsble agreement with the thermal conduc-
tivities of seversl related metal alloys. The surface tension of an NaF-
BeF, (64436 mole %) mixture was measured over the range from 600 to 8009C}.

Comparison with data obtained previously on several LiF—Ber-ThF4-UF4-mix-

tures shows the current results to be somewhat higher. Improvements in ' - .
the experimental procedure and in the instrumentation have led to in- =
creased precision in the maximum-bubble-pressure technique for surface- | L

tension determination. Liquid densities for the NeF-BeF, mixture obtained
in the course of the surface-tension experiment agree with empiridhl,den-
sity estimates to within 7%. | | _'
Additional data have beeﬁ obtained for heat transfer to BULT-1l4 flo#4
ing within heated Inconel and INOR-8 tubes. Approximately 4500 hr of op-
eration have been accumulated under primarily isothermal (1150°F) condi-

-tions. No systematic variation of the heat-transfer coefficient has been

observed during this time. Reanalysis of the data using recent values for
the heat capacity led to an improvement in the comparison between the BULT-
14 results and the general heat-transfer correlations, while adversely af-
fecting the experimental heat balances. The previously reported discrep-
ancy between the heat transfer in the Inconel and INOR-8 tubes has been

resolved. Mean values of the heat-transfer modulus for both sets of data

T

now agree closely; the Inconel-tube data, however, exhibit a greater'ex-

perimental scatter.

Part 2. Materials Studies

 

2.1 Metallurgy

Examinations of nine INOR-8 thermal-convection loops, which operated

with fused fluoride mixtures for one year, were completed. Five of the

loops showed no attack, and the other four exhibited very light attack in

the form of shallow subsurface voids. Seven Inconel thermal-convection | -

loops were also examined, all of which showed attack in the form of inter-
granular voids to depths ranging from 4 to 15 mils.

Examinations of four Inconel forced-convection loops, which operated
for different periods with fluoride salt of the LiF-BeF,-UF, system, re-
vealed heavy subsurface-void formation in regions where loop wall temper-
atures exceeded 1200°F. Maximum attack ranged to 7 mils after 3000 hr of
~operation and to 15 mils after one year of operation.

Metallogrephlc examinations were completed on three INOR-8 forced-
convection loops which operated with fluoride mixtures for periods of one
year or longer; with the exception of one loop, negligible attack was
found. In that one loop, hot-leg attack, in the form of surface roughen-
ing and surface pitting, was found to a maximum depth of 1-1/2 mils. Ex-
amination of the cold-leg regions of this loop revealed the presence of
metal erystals, the composition of which was determined to be predominantly
nickel. The fuel mixture circulated in the loop showed appreciable oxide
contamination, apparently as a result of H,0 entering the system during
operation. , |

Chemical and metallographic examinations were carried out to investi-
gate the thin corrosion film which has appeared in a majority of the long-
term INOR-8 cdrrosion loops. Qualitative chemical analyses indicated the
f1lm to be composed primarily of nickel, with smaller amounts of iron,
chromium, and molybdenum, Hardness data obtained indicated that the film
was approximately twice as hard as the base metal.

~ The 48% Ti—48% Zr~4% Be alloy'was used to braze an assembly of graph-
ite tubes to an: INOR 8 header 1n order to demonstrate the feasibility of
fabricating such an assembly.n;zﬁiﬂ,7ﬁﬁsi Co . _

tions, indicate that these alloys ‘are brittle and tend to crack. = Thus
alloys with somewhat less flowability but more ductility are being con-

Difficulty has been experienced in brazing low-porosity graphlte, in

contrast to experience with highly porous grades. More suitable joint de-

signs and/or new, stronger bonding alloys are being investlgated to over-

come this difficulty. ,

Thirty-one different grades of graphite have been tested for their
resistance to‘permeation by molten fluorides in 100-hr screening tests at
1300°F and pressures of 150 psig. Twenty-four of the grades were manu-
factured as low permeability; and of these, four grades, B-1, S-4-IB, GIT-
123-82, end CS-112-S, had less than 0.5% of their bulk volume permeated

by molten'fluorides in the screening test. It appears that for some

grades, significant decreases in molten-fluoride-salt permeation can be

accomplished by proper pressure reductions. Moderately-low-permeability
grades*(R-4 and S-4) were permeated to the same extent by molten fluoride
salts under 150 psig at 1300°F (704°C) in l-hr exposures as they were in
100-hr exposures.

Grade AGOT graphite was impregnated with molten bismuth and subse-

quently subjected to a standard fuel-permeation test. Results showed thsat

the bismuth pretreatment suppressed the fuel pickup, but the bismuth was
not completely retained in the graphite pores during the fuel-permeation
test.

Two tests have been conducted to remove from graphite the oxygen con-

tamination that causes a portion of the uranium of LiF-BeF,-UF, (62-37-1
mole %, fuel 130) to precipitate as U0, when this fuel is exposed to the
graphite at 1300°F (704°C) in a vacuum. A 50-hr exposure of grade AGOT

graphite to hydrogen preheated to 1300°F (704°) failed to detectably de-

crease the oxygen contamination. However, the- thermal decomposition of

crystals of ammonium bifluoride inside a grade AGOT graphite crucible ap-

parently was successful in removing the oxygen contamination. Fuel 130
has been exposed for 1000 hr to this graphite at 1300°F (704°C) withbut.
any uranium precipitation that could be detected by radiography.

INOR-8 was carburized to a depth of 14 mils while in direct contact -

- for 3400 hr with grade TSF graphite at 1000 psi in fuel 30 (N&F-ZrF4-UF4,

50-46-4 mole %) at 1300°F (704°c)

L Three niekelAbase brazing alloys (Coast Metals No. 52 and 53, and
’%‘i)igf' -;} General Electric No. 81), the 82% Au-18% Ni alloy, and the pure copper
S brazing material showed good corrosion resistence to fuel 130 (LiF-BeF,-
. UF,, 62-37-1 mole %) at 1300°F (704°C) during a 10,000-hr thermal-con-
vection loop test of INOR-8 Jjoints. It was noted that the commercial

 

 

. nickel~base alloys were corroded when used with Inconel as the base metal.
-_ Results of initial corrosion studies on experimental Au-Ni-Ta alloys have
1ndicated that they have good resistance to both the NeF-Zr¥,- and the
LiF-BeF,-base fuels., These alloys are being developed to investigate

possible graéhite-to-graphite and graphite-to-metal joining methods.

e Accdrdihg to preliminary checks on phase behavior, the substitution
or addition of ZrF, in IiF-BeF, fuels containing UF, and THF, appears to
~be a feasible route to potential improvements in corrosion behavior and
perhaPS‘oxide'toleranCe‘while at the same time retaining favorable in-
_venteries and physical properties; Such quinary fuels can be regarded as
ARE NeF-ZrF, fuels modified as follows: Substitute 67 mole % Li’F for all
. the NeF and substitute BeF, for half of the ZrF, to reduce both the melt-
| ~ ing poiﬁt and the ZrF, volatility, giving LiF-ZrF4-BeF2 in a mole ratio
_ Qf 6-1-1;'Either'UF4'or ThF, may then be interchanged with ZrF, as de-
"5_,'sired, with'ohly minor alterations of the over-all chemical and physical
| .properfies (except density, which increases by 50% for complete inter-
:e.change with the heavy elements) | |

~In order to evaluate the applicability of information about dif-
fusion rates of Cr° end. their role in controlling the rate of corrosion

of INOR-8 by fluoride}fnels, twcfanisothermal convection loop tests have.

‘been studied under COnditions such that the diffusion behavior could be

followed. The agreement between calculated and experimental behavior was
very satlsfactory o , |

Much of a 1ong-stand1ng discrepancy in the behav1or of Nng has been
resolved through a redetermination of the free energy of formation of NiF,
by means of experlments in whlch HF corrodes Nio under conditions such _ : N
that the eqnilibrlum,constant for the reactlon can be measured accurately. | |

Periodic eampling and, analy51s of the_corro51on products found in long-

term forced-circulation corrosion test loops has been continued; some of

the results are uninterpretable in terms of the expected steady-state be-

havior, but mbst of such unpredicted deviations are sufficiently pronounced

to be regarded ae reflecting experimental difficulties rather than inherent |

behavior of the intended systemQ '
In exploring the conditions under which intercalation of graphite by

salts can occur, no effect was found with NaCl-FeCl, (70-30 mole %) at

750°C or with NaCl-FeCl, (46-54 mole %) at 200°C for 7-1/2 hr, although

pure FeCl, crumbles graphite at 300°C in 2 hr or less. DBoth high temper-

atures and dilution of the intercalatant are presumed to diminish the tend-

ency toward reaction. | | _ '__ o .~
Out-of-pile studies with fuels containing tracer rare earths in con- f_n<' v

tact with graphite have been initieted to provide a background for an in- :

vestlgatlon of permeated samples whlch have been irradiated.

The use of purlfled fuels in engineering and corrosion tests has been

greater than had been antlclpated, so that a stcckplle of fuels of current

interest no longer exists.

containing little or no thorium, Under proper conditions the NO,~HF so-
lutions dissolve UF, along with the LiF and BeF,, and decontamination from
rare earths is satisfactory.

Hot saturated aqueous ammonium fluoride solutions have a reasonable
solubility for thorium fluoride, but the solubility of LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF,
salts is much lower. No adequate processing method has yet been found for
fuel salts containing ThF,.

In a single experiment no protactinium was removed from MSR blanket
salt by fluorination at 650°C.

1.1 COMPONENT DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING

Molten-Salt-lubricated Bearings for Fuel Pumps

Hydrodynamic Journal Bearings

 

Investigations were continued with Jjournal bearings operating sub-
merged in molten salt 130 (LiF-BeF,-UF,;, 62-37-1 mole %). Test 22, re-
ported previously,1 was completed. Test 18 was repeated, and two addi-
tional endurance tests were begun. A summary of the test conditions is
presented in Table 1.1.1 (see also Fig. 1.1.l).

Test 22 was terminated on schedule after 494 hr. During the latter
part of the test, 170 start-stop cycles were performed.

Test 23 was a repeat of test 18, with new parts, with approximately
the same results. Impending seizure was evident at loads above 25 lbg;
50 the test was terminated.

Test 24 was performed to investigate the endurance of the bearing
at steady-state operating conditions. After 80 hr of operation the drive
motor experienoed a sudden power surge, and the test was suspended for
examination. Examination revealed that the flow restriction at the dis-
charge end of the grooves was not sufficient to prevent the bearing from
becoming "starved."

Test 25 was a repeat of test 24, with new bearing parts. In this
~ case the bearing grooves had a radius of 1/8 in. compared with the 1/4
in. in test 24. The test was terminated after 497 hr of operation be-
cause of seizure of the bearlng.‘ Examination revealed that the flow re-
strictlon at the dlscharge end of the grooves was not concentrlc with

. the bearing'bore and therefore the bearlng rubbed against the journal,

' fﬂlfcausing the seizure._ Steps are belng taken to ensure concentricity with

'e '-ffuture bearlngs.t;ﬁfﬂf;j,

Journal Bearing.

The Jjournal bearing in test 3 experienced a seizure after 11 hr of
operation, and subsequent examination revealed that foreign material
entered the bearing clearance space, resulting in the seizure.

In tests 4, 5, and 6, the three~helical-groove bearing configuration
mounted with gimbals was utilized. After 1000 hr of operation in test 4,
the bearing and journal were fully suiteble for further operation. At

disassembly, the journal was damaged in removal from the shaft and there-

fore could not be re-used. The bearing and journal used in test 5 were

fully sultable for - further use and are under test in test 6. This test

has operated for more than 850 hr, to date, and pump rotation has been

,st0pped and started 41 tlmes.

Mechanical Seals for Pumps

The operation of the modified Fulton Sylphon bellows-mounted seal,?
undergoing test in a PKP type of centrifugal pump circulating NeK, was
suspended due to an increase of leakage of oil from the lower seal of the
shaft. The total operating time was 18,834 hr at 1200 to 1225°F. The
average oil leakage from the upper and lower seals, respectively, was 0.6
and 0.8 cc/day. Unaccounted-for oil leakage averaged 35 cc/day; presum=
ably, it leaked into the process systeﬁ. Examinetion of the pump rotary
assembly revealed that (1) the lower seal faces had worn considerably;

(2) the upper seal was in good condition; and (3) the impeller was in good
condition, but with an etched appearance in the flow passages. The normal
drainage passages to the catch basin for oil leakage past the lower seal
had become filled with a viscous, greaselike substance. This plugging maj
well have diverted the unaccounted=-for oil leakage downward through the
pump—shaft annulus and into the system. The plug material was a mixture
of carbon and the oxides of sodium and potassium. The pump rotary assem-

bly, with modifications to the shaft lower seal, is being prepared for

further test circulation of Nak.

Loop for Study of MP-Pump Performance

 

An MF type of centrifugal pump has continued in operation® and has
logged more than 25,000 hr of continuous operation. Since the previous
report period the pump has continued operating in a region of cavitation

at 2700 rpm, 645 gpm, and 2. 5-p81g_pump-tank cover-gas pressure. Molten

'_ salt 30 at. 1200°F is belng pumped._ The average ‘seal-oil leakage collected

from the‘upper and lcwer seals was 26 and 16 cc/day, respectively..An U~
accountedrfor loss of oil averaging 56 cc/day has been cbserved. Presum-

ably, 1t leaks into the process system.. The pump was stopped nine times;

%7‘two tlmes for lO min each to replace brushes in the drive motor, two times

for lO'min each to replace brushes in the motor-generator set; three times
for 5 m1n each to replace the alr filters 1n the motor-generator set and

two times fOr 3 min each durlng a scheduled power outage.

Frozen-Lead Pump Seal

The small frozen-lead-sealed pump,? consisting of a centrifugal pump
mounted vertically over & fractional-horsepower motor drive, has opérated
continuously during this period to accumulate 16,500 hr of continucus op-
erétion. No seal leakage occurred, and no maintenance was required during,

this period., The pump circulates molten salt at 1200°F.

Remote-Maintenance Develbﬁment Facility

 

A remote-msintenance facility incorporating & high-temperature =

(1200°F) mockup of a 20-Mw (thermal) molten-salt-fueled reactor has been

constructed (see Fig. 1.1.2). The purpose is to investigate the prdblems 
ihvleed in remotely maintaining a reactor system which cannot be gp-
jroachéd for direct maintenance because of radioactive fission'prOducts—
and induced activity in the reactor components. Tools, techniques, and
procedures have been developed for removing and replacing all major com-
pbnents, including heat exchangers, the primary fuel pump, the reactor .
core vessel, pipe preheaters, and piping sections. AllL maintenance op-
erations are performed by a single operator from a remotely located con-
trol center, using closed-circuit television as the only means of viewihg
(Fig. 1.1.3).

Prior to circulating molten salt in the system, techniques and pro-
cedures were checked out by repeated performance of the required mainte-
nance bperations. Numerous modifications were incorporated in the loop,
as the need arose, either to improve visibility through the cameras or

to facilitate maintenance operations. A specially designed remotely op~

erated pneumatic bolt runner and torque tool was developed to loosen and -

tighten the bolts on the 3 1/2- and 6-in. freeze flange clamps (see Fig.

1.1.4).

~ After all tools were developed, and when all operations could be

performed by the operator, 120 gal of a molten-salt mixture consisting

of sodium fluoride, zirconium fluoride, and uranium fluoride was circu-

lated through the loop at 1200°F. The run was terminated and the molten

'tinuing on thelr replacement. (See Flgs. l 1.5 through 1.1.8.)

To remove and replace a component it must be possible to remotely

break and remake pipe connections to 1eak-tight spec1f1cations.r The

'freeze flange develoPed at the Leboratory is used at 20 locatlons in this

*system. Such a JOlnt takes advantage of the eblllty of the molten salt

to form a frozen seal between flange faces. (see Flg. 1.1.9).

Design, Construction, and Operation of Materials Testing Loops

Forced-Circulation Corrosion Loops

 

The operation of long-term forced-circulation corrosion-testing loops
was continued. Including this and previous report periods, a total of 25
of these loops,* in various configurations and with various fluoride salts,
have operated in the MSR corrosion program. Of this number, five each of
INOR-8 and of Inconel have heen terminated for examination, after an av-
erage of 10,250 hr of operation. Three have been terminated for examina-'
tion after less than a year of operation. |

Loops presently operating and those terminated during this period

are shown in Table 1.1.3. Eight of the operating loops have exceeded a

‘year,‘while three more recently operated loops have less than a yeer of

0peration at AT conditions.
| Three INOR-8 loops, 9354-1, MSRPLlB and 9354-4 were terminated |
during this. -period. INOR-8 loop 9354-1 was terminated after 14,378 hr;r

when a salt leak occurred in the second heater section. Loop MSRP—chwas

the cooler coil. Loop 9354-4,° which began operation with three double-
walled inserts, was terminated on schedule after 15,140 hr of operation.
An insert was removed after each 5000 hr of operation for weight-loss
determination. The results of the examination of these loops, when com~
pleted, will be reported by the Metallurgy section.

One new INOR-8 loop, MSRP-16, wes placed in operation on Nov. 4,
1959, with salt mixture BULT-14. This loop is equipped with a sampling
device for molten salt and incorporates three double-walled inserts in
the second heater section.® The sections will be removed at different
operating intervals for weight-loss determination. This loop operates at
a high wall temperature of 1500°F and at a 200°F AT,

Design and Testing of & Frozen-Salt Metal-to-Graphite Joint

 

During the past quarter, a frozen-salt graphite-to-metal joint was
tested in & circulating-salt system. The purpose of this test was to in-
dicate the feasibility of a frozen-salt seal between the core and blanket
salts of a graphite-moderated'moltén-Salt reactor.

The test was conductéd;with & molten-salt pump and loop coupled to
the test piece shqwn'in‘Fig.'lal,lO.  The crucible was machined from a

molded block of type S-4 graphite. The frozen-salt seal was formed in

the annulus'bétweén"the outside'diameterjofrthe'graphite crucible and

the.insidg'diametef of an_Inconel:cylinder:which was water-cooled. The

 configuration simulates the inlet or outlet header of & molten-salt

-containment vessel.

The salt flow entered the top of the test plece through the small,
center graphite tube and up the crucible past the seal area to the out-
let. The Inconel skirt extending paét'the seal area serves as & thermal
barrier. |

The test joint was opereteé'under two conditions of differential
pressure across the seal. The seal differential pressure, which was con-
trolled by pump head and helium‘backup pressure on the outside of the
crucible, was held at 0.5 and 18 psi for the two tests. There was no salt
leakage past the seal into the catch basin in either test. However, the
salt did extrude through the crucible walls during the second test. A
complete report of test conditions is in process.”

The test plece was dismounted after the second test, as shown in
Fig. 1l.1.11. The upper flange, containing the graphite crucible and
Inconel joint, was removed from the pot and cut as shown at 1. The
frozen-salt seal annulus formed can be seen at 2. The salt frozen in the
thermal-barrier annulus formed by the Inconel skirt can be seen at 3. The

upper rim and lower portion of the graphite crucible are shown at 4 and

-5, respectively.

In-Pile Loops

The first graphite-fuel capsule irradiastion test, designated ORNL-
MTR-47-1, has been completed. This test was for the purpose of studying
fuel and fission-product penetratlon 1nto graphite under conditions sim-

ulating those of - a graphite core molten-salt reactor. The capsules have

Qbeen shlpped'back to ORNL endonow are awalting disassembly. The only
:difficulty experienced in this test which 1asted 720 hr, was the loss

' of the sodium—tank heaters._ Operatlon continued.Without interruption.

Physical Property Measurements

 

Enthalpy and Heat Capacilty
Analysis of the prev1ously reported datal on the enthalpy of the BULT-
14 mixture (LiF-BeF,-UF,-ThF,, 67-18.5-0.5-14 mole %) has been completed.

The results can be expressed as follows:
1. For the solid (100-400°C),
H, — H3o (cal/g) = —=5.0 + 0.185t + (7.8 x 107°)¢2

where t is the temperature (°C).
2. For the liquid (500-800°C),

H, — Hso (cal/g) = —61.5 + 0.493t — (11.71 x 107°)t?
3. The heat of fusion at 450°C is 44.5 cal/g.

The heat capacities in the liquid state of the BeF,-containing salt

mixtures studied to date are summarized in Table 1l.2.1.

Thermal Conductivity

 

A longitudinal-heat-flow comparison-type apparatus has been used to
measure the thermal conductivity of an INOR-8 specimen at temperatures up
to 1000°F. The essential features of the experimental device are 1llus-
trated in Fig. 1.2.1, The test specimen (a 6-in.-long, 1l-in.-dia rod) is
contained between cylindrical heat meters of Armco iron of like diameter.
Thermocouples (located at the axial center line in radial wells) are spaced
1l in. apart along the length of the apparatus. Radisl guard heating is
prov1ded at discrete 1ntervals by a set of heated plates. An electrical
heat source at the top of the upper heat meter and & water sink below the
lower meter complete the apparatus.~ ‘The entire assembly is contained with-
1n an inert atmosphere box to ensure against ‘surface ox1dation at the
higher operating temperatures.” o

A typical longitudlnal temperature profile is shown in Fig. 1.2.2;

Surface Tension
The surface tension of an NaF-BeF, (64-36 mole %) mixture has been

 

determined over the temperature range 600-800°C using the maximum-bubble-
pressure technique.? The results are given in Fig. 1.2.5 and compared
with earlier m.easurements4 with mixtures LiF-BeF,-UF, (62-37-1 mole %)
and LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF,; (62-36.5-1-0.5 mole %).

Improvements in the experimental procedure and in the instrumenta-
tion have resulted in an increase in both the preciéion and the accuracy
of these determinations., The original pressure-sensing and -recording
arrangement (a differential-pressure cell and strip-chart recorder) was
subject to calibration shifts of the order of *3%., Replacement of these
units by a precision manometer resulted in an increase in reproducibility
of several orders of magnitude. At the same time, the greater sensitivity
of the pressure measurement allowed correction for two effects leading to
premature bubble collapse, namely, the rate of bubble formation and fluc-

tuations in the environmental pressure. The total error in this deter-

mination is now estimated to be of the order of £3%, as compared with *8%

for the earlier studies.

To correct for the effect of the depth of immersion of the capillary

u - tube on the bubble press'ure-,* measurements were made at a number of levels
| (up to 8 mm below the salt surface) for each temperature. From these data,
it is possible to make an estimate of the density of the salt. Preliminary
results are compared in Fig. 1.2.6 with the density estimated from the cor-

relation by Cohen and Jones ;7 the agreement is reasonable.

result. Since the pump curve was obtained initially by calibration with
reference to the flowmeter {the performance characteristic for the turbine. (;J
meter having been established independently), a 3% inconsistency exists
in the flow rates for all At runs in the MB series. The designations MA
and MB have been used to differentiate between the data taken before and
" after the shutdown, respectively. This flow uncertainty affects directly
both the calculated Reynolds modulus and the heat-transfer coefficient;

The experimental results (as the heat-transfer parameter, NNu/NO'é)

are shown in Fig. 1.2.7 for the INOR-8 section and in Fig. 1.2.8 forPEhe
Inconel section. All the data® have been re-evaluated, uéing the recently
deteﬁmined values for the heat capacity of the BULT-14 mixture, (See the
pfeviOus séctioﬂ, "Physical-Property Measurements.") This resulted in an
incréaée in the mégnitude of the heat-transfer parameter of about 10%. At
the'same time, the heaﬁ balances (the ratio of the heat gained by the'salt
in passing through the‘test section to the electrical energy input) were
adverseiy affected to the extent that all values are now greater then
unity (renging as high as 1.6). A detailed re-examination of the experi-
mental instrumentation and a redetermination of the enthalpy of the salt
are piannéd in an effort to obtain an explanation for this situatioh. |

The data given in Figs. 1.2.7 and 1.2.8 show a general scatter'of the

order of *10%. However, the varisbility of the Inconel-tube data within

this scatter band is greater than that observed for the INOR-8 tube. The
cause of this 1ncreased deviation is not yet understood Since the salt
was drained from the loop during the thermocouple and electrical repair
operation, the data have been differentiated as to this aspect (series MA
and MB). There does not appear to have been a significant effect, although
(for the limited data available) a number of unexpectedly low values of

the heat-transfer parameter were calculated. No systematic temporal vari-
ation of the heat-transfer coefficient has been observed.

For comparison, the heat-transfer characteristics for a number of
previously studied salts? 12 are also given in Figs. 1.2.7 and 1.2.8. The
data for both the Inconel and INOR-8 tubes are seen to lie about 25% be-
low the general heat-transfer correlation!?

for normal fluids in turbulent flow within circular tubes under moderate

At conditions, as well as below the experimental results for other molten

~salts. This discrepancy, if attributed entirely to the lack of experi-

mental deta on the thermal conductivity of the BULT-14 salt, would require
8 decrease in the thermal conductivity by almost a factor of 2 [from the
estimated value of 1.3 Btushr £t t+(°F)"!]. The previously observed®
difference between the INOR-8 and Inconel data was found to arise from an
error in the value of the tube surface area used in the analysis. After
correction, the originally low results for the INOR-8 tube agreed closely
with the Inconel-tube data.

2.1 METALLURGY

Dynamic Corrosion Studies

 

Thermal.~Convection Loops

Test results for 16 thermal-convection loops (nine of INOR-8 and seven
of Inconel) which were operated with fluoride mixtures are summarized in
Tables 2.1.1 and 2.1.2. These tests mark the completion of all phases of
the molten-fluoride corrosion program' dealing with thermal-convection eﬁ-
periments. ,

As may be seen in Table 2.1.1, the attack in five of the INOR-8 ex-

»

periments, all of which operated for one year, was limited to surface

roughening and pitting to a maximum depth of 1/2 mil. Figure 2.1.1 is

v)

representative of the attack found in these loops. One loop, 1224, which
circulated salt 123 (NeF-LiF-BeF,, 53-46-1 mole %) for 8760 hr at a maximum
| temperaxure of 1350°F, showed slightly greater attack, in the form of sur-
face pitting to a maximum depth of 1 mil. Three loops, 1216, 1226, and
1244, exhibited attack in the form of shallow subsurface voids. The max-
imum depth of attack in loop 1216 was 1-1/2 mils, whereas in 1226 and 1244
the maximum depth of attack was limited to 1/2 mil. No attack, except for
light roughening of the surfaces, was found in the cold legs of the loops.
Also, examination of the cold regions revealed no deposits or other evi-
dence of mass transfer.
An extremely thin corrosion film was found on the surfaces of several

5of these loops. As prev1ously discussed 2 fllmlng has occurred in a ma-

Inconel Forced-Convection Loops

 

The status of Inconel forced-convection loops presently in operation
is discussed in Sec 1.1 of this report. A report discussing the results
for four Inconel loops (9377-1, -2, -3, and -4) was recently issued.’ The
results are summarized in Table 2.1.3.

In general, the attack in all four loops followed the characteristilc
pattern for Inconel loops in contact with fluoride mixtures at higher tem-

peratures; namely, the attack showed a strong dependence on the inside wall

temperature.4 The attack in all the loops was limited to regions where the

loop wall temperature exceeded 1200°F, and the depths of attack at these
positions were quite consistent when viewed at similar time periods. As

can be seen in Table 2.1.3, the rates of attack found at the 3000-hr time

“interval and the 9000-hr time interval were consistent within 1 mil,

INOR-8 Forced-Convection Loops

 

As discussed in Sec 1.1, eleven INQR-S forced—convection'lobps have
completed operation for one year or longér with fused fluoride mixtures.
Operation of six of these loops has been terminated, and four of the six
loops have been examined (Table 2.1.4). Loop 9354-5, which contained spec-
imens'of graphite in the hot-leg section, was discussed previously.sl As
noted at that time, examination of this loop revealed no manifestations of
corrosive attack beyond‘the start of a thin surface film.

Similar results (Table 2.1.4) were obtained from the recent examina-
tions of loops MSRP-8 and -9, which circulated fluoride mixtures for 9633
and 9687 hr, respectively. Both loops appeared unattacked, except for the
development of the thin surface layer. The extent of this layer can be
seen in Figs. 2.1.2 and 2.1.3, which show the metallographic sppearance of
the hot-leg sections from the latter loops. (Results of chemical analyses
of some of these layers are discussed in the next section.)

Considerably greater attack was noted, however, in loop 9354-1, which
vas terminated after 14,563 hr because of a leak which developed in the

second heater leg. This loop encountered operational difficulties at two

earlier periods, each of which necessitated suspension of operation and the

replacement of loop components.® As noted in Table 2.1.4, metallographic
examinations of specimens removed from the hot-leg regions revealed general
surface roughening and pitting to a maximum depth of 1-1/2 mils (Fig.
2.1.4). Attack elsewhere in the loop appeared negligible. In contrast,
two specimens removed from the hot legs after 3000 hr (at the time of the

first of the component failures) revealed no attack.

Analysis of Corrosion Film. — Chemical and metallurgical studies were

 

undertaken to investigate the nature and causes of the thin corfosion films
Observed in long~term INOR-8 corrosion loops, as discussed aboﬁe. The film
appears as a continuous second phése which extends below the exposed sur-
faces to a thickness of 1/2 mil or less. No transition or diffusion zone
has been evident between the film and the base metal (Figs. 2.1.1, 2.1.2,
and 2.1.3). In thermal-convection loops the film has been observed both
in hot- and cold-leg specimens; in forced-convection loops it has been
found only along the tubing between the pump exit and the end of the second
heater leg. - |
Comparative hardnesses of the film and:parent metal of one of the
specimens were recently determined by using a Bergman microhardneSs teéter
with a 1-g load. The portion of the film examined was approximately 1/3
mil thick and was removed from the point of maximum salt-metal interface

1-g load, the £1lm was found to have & DPH (dismond pyrsmid hardness) of
518, and the DPH for the parent metal was 269. A check of the base metal
using the Tukon hardness tester with a 200-g load indicated a DPH of 218.
Although the numbers based on the Bergman tester appear to be slightly
high, the values obtained demonstrate that the film 1s approximately twice
as hard as the parent metal, as shown in Fig. 2.1.5.

Since none of the films have been more than 1/2 mil thick, it has been
extremely difficult to determine their chemiéal composition. However,
qualitative analyses of these films were recently carried out with the aid
of C. E. Zachary of the Metallographic Group. These analyses were made on
material "scrubbed" from the inside surfaces of the tubes with a corundum
slurry, the specimens being weighed before and after to determine the amount
of material removed. The resulting mixture of slurry and metal, along with
an unused sample of the slurry as a blank, was then submitted for spectro-
graphic analysis.

Analyses obtained for several different specimens of this surface film

are listed in Table 2.1.6. The films were composed primarily of nickel and

Graphite Brazing Studies

 

The development of techniques for brazing graphite to itself and to
metals is of continuing interest for molten-salt power reactor systems
with a high~breeding-ratio potential. A study of these procedures has been
under way during the past year, and the progress has been reported in the
last few progress reports.s'9 Recent findings are summarized in this re-
port.

The premising brazing characteristics of the 48 Ti—48% Zr—4% Be
brazing alloy were discussed in the last report.? In order to demonstrate
the general feasibility of brazing assemblies of graphite tubes to metal
headers, a demonstration assembly was fabricated with this alloy. An ex-
ploded view of the assembly is shown in Fig. 2.1.6.

The first step was to braze the CT-158 fine-grained extruded graphite
tubing to a molybdenum ring using the Ti-Zr-Be alloy. The molybdenum ring
was used as a transitidn.layer between the graphite and the INOR-8 base
plate. Because of its low coefficien£ of thermal expansion and its ability
to absorb shearing stressee, the molybdenumiacts as a buffer and tends to
minimize the possibility'6f=ehearing'in the graphite by stresses which re-
sult from the large difference in thermal expansion ‘between graphite and
INOR-8. '

The final assembly was made by brazing the ‘molybdenum in the graphite-

'molybdenum subassemblles to the INOR g plate with a. commerc1ally available
o alloy, Coast Metals No. 53 (Ni-Cr-B-Sl-Fe) The completed assembly is shown

in Fig 2.1. 7.

The utilization of the Ti~Zr-Be alloy for molten-salt reactor appli-
cstions has been shown to be severely limited by virtue of its poor cor-
rosion resistance to fluoride salts.® A brazing-alloy development program
was subsequently initiated for the express purpose of obtaining brazing
alloys which wet and flow on graphite at reasonable brazing temperatures
(< 1300°C) and which are eorrosion resistant to the fused salts. The cor-
rosion-resistant 82% Au—18% Ni alloy*© was selected as a potential starting
material, and it may find use in certain selected applications. Corro-
sion-resistant carbide-forming elements such as tantalum or molybdenum
were added to promote wetting.

Promising ternary compositions were selected through an analysis of
the avallable binary phase diagrams of the Au-Ni-Ta and Au-Ni-Mo systems.
To date, 10-g buttons of approximastely forty Au-Ni-Ta and thirty Au-Ni-Mo
alloys have been arc-cast and evalusted. Figures 2.1.8 and 2.1.9, respec-
tively, indicate the compositions of these alloys. The flow behavior, in
vacuum, of small fragments of alloys in the Au-Ni-Mo system on graphite at
1300°C is shown in Fig. 2.1.10.

Flowability studies have been conducted with these alloys on both
graphite-to-graphite joints and graphite-to-molybdenum joints. The alloy
compositions in the two systems which flow well on graphite-to-graphite
Joints are enclosed by dashed lines in Figs. 2.1.8 and 2.1.9. However,
alloys containing lower percentages of carbide-forming elements flow ad-
equately on graphite—to—molybdenum Joints and are more ductile than those
requlred for graphiteuto-graphite Joints,

The 35% Au—35% Nl—BO%'Mb alloy has been investigated in view of its
application for Joints of both types. Figure:Z l 11 shows joints contain-

~ ing low-permeability'graphite tubes butt-brazed to a 1/4 in.-thick molyb-
| ‘v;denum.plate and to an AGOT graphite plate. The alloy was preplaced around
fr_3dthe outside diameter of the graphite tubes'before 1nduction brazing. Full
lpenetratlon of the braze through the joints and subsequent filletlng on

- the 1nside diameters can be seen., A photomlcrograph of a graphite-to-mo-

lybdenum.goint brazed w1th thlS alloy is shown in Fig. 2.1.12.

crushing as arc-melted buttons. It should be possible, however, to obtain
adequate flow on graphite-to-molybdenum joints with alloys of improved
ductility by reducing the molybdenum or tantalum contents. This possi-

bility is being investigated.

Permeation of Graphite by Mblten‘Salts

The use of unclad graphite as a moderator in a molten-salt reactor
requires that not more than a small percentage of the graphite pore space
be filled with salt. To ensure this condition, a test program 1l has been
in progress to study the permeation of various potential grades of graphite
by molten selt (BULT 14~.5U) at 1300°F and for various times and pressures.

Thirty-one grades of graphite have been tested under the conditions
described above. Ail grades were manufactured as low-permeability grades
except seven: CCN, CEY-B, R-0013, GI-123, SMél, TSF, and AGOT. Results
of the screening tests are summarized in Table 2.1.7. There are now four
grades, B-1, S-4-IB, GT-123-82, and CS-112-S, that meet the permeation
specification, under the screening-test conditions, that less than 0.5% of
the bulk volume of graphite be filled with salts. These results are from
specimens taken from single pieces of graphite that were relatively small.

In an attempt to determine the effect of pressure on permeation, 20
grades of graphite that were available at the time this test was assembled
were screened at a lower pressure, Three or more specimens of each of the
20 grades were exposed simultaneously for 100 hr to LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF, (67-
18.5-14-0.5 mole %, BULT 14—,5U) at 1300°F (704°C) and 95 psig, a potential
reactor fluoride-salt pressure. The results of this test are compared in
Table 2.1.8 with those obtained from previous tests in which the pressure
was 150 psig. This test suggests that if the reactor pressure were 95
pslg, four additional grades, CT- 150 CEY-135O CT~-158, and CEY-G, might
be brought within the MSRP specification.

The grades of graphite +thet showed the greatest reductions in quantity
of salt permeation as & result of the lower pressure have the highest per-

'centage of small pores comprising their total accessible voids. These
graphites also are those that were fabricated as relatively small shapes.

Uhder the assumption that other reector conditions will not signifi~
cantly modify'permeation, it appears that for some grades of graphite,

However, a specific grede or grades of graphite chosen for a reactor should
be thoroughly investigated, since the low-permeability grades are still
relatively new. |

Studies of fluoride permeation of graphite as & function of time have
been initiated with AGOT, S-4, and R-4 grades, which were chosen because
they are in plentiful supply. A partially completed series of tests indi-
cates that a l-hr exposure of these grades to BULT 14—.5U at 1300°F (704°C)
under a pressure of 150 psig produced the same degree of permeation as did
100-hr exposures under like conditions.

Grade R-4 greaphite is one in which relatively large, accessible voids
were partially filled with carbon to decrease its permeability. The graph-
ite was impregnated with pitch, and the pitch was thermally converted to
-smorphous carbon. Metallographic examinations indicated that the original
voids were approximately two-thirds filled with carbon. An exploratory
test was made to determine the relationship of permeability vs location in
this grade of graphite.

A standard permeation screening test as described sbove was made on
four specimens from the original surface of the graphite and three speci-
mens approximately 1/2 to 1 in. away from this surface. The specimens were
nominally 1/2 in. in diameter and 1-1/2 in. long. The bulk volume of the
graphite permeated by BULT 14—.5U averaged 1.4% (0.7 to 2.7%) for specimens
that were located at the surface and 3.0% (2.3 to 4.2%) for those not at

- the surface., Mbre tests would be necessary to fully evaluate the varia-

tions 1n the fluoride salt permeability of grade Redeo However, these data
indicate that for the impregnation technique used the lowest permeebllity

-fvalues extend over short distances, 1/2 to l 1n. The average percentage
'sfffor all seven specimens was 2.1, which compares well with a 1.9 average

rﬁrvalue in previous tests for six s1milar specimens from random positions.

determine if the bismuth which had permeated the graphite pores would be
retained within them during reactor tempersture and pressure cycles. The
latter was important not only in maintaining resistance to salt permeation

but also in preventing contact of the bismuth with the nickel-base alloy

- container, since nickel-base alloys have limited corrosion resistance to

bismuth at temperatures as low as 520°F (27O°C).13

Results of the standard fuel-permeation test with the bismuth-im-
pregnated graphite showed that the bismuth suppresséd the permeation by
fuel but did not eliminate it. Chemical analyses of six successive 1/16-
in.-thick layers machined from the graphite épeéimen‘showed a deéreasing
uranium content as shown in Table 2.1.9. | | |

Bismuth was not completely retained in the-graphite pores during the
fuel-permeation test, and this resulted in some attack of the Inconel con-
tainer by the bismuth,

Bismuth impregnation will be tested to determine its effectiveness
in inhibiting fuel permeation of low-permeability small-pore-diameter

graphite, as the graphite becomes available.

Removal of Oxygen Contamination from Graphite

 

Work has continued on methods for removing oxygen contamination from
graphite as a means of eliminating precipitation.of U0, from LiF-BeF,-UF,
salt systems. As previously reported,'4 an expensive method of purging
graphite of oxygen contaminants has been found. Other methods investigated
include the use of preheated hydrogen and the thermal decomposition of am-
monium bifluoride, NH,F-.HF.

In a single test, flushing an AGOT-grade graphlte crucible with pre-
heated hydrogen for 50 hr at 1300°F (704°C) prior to charging it with fuel
130 (LiF-BeF,-UF,, 62-37-1 mole %) did not detectably alter the quantity
of uranium that is normally precipitated from fuel 130 by contaminants of
this graphite.

The test system was evacuated for 15 hr at less than 2 u Hg pressure
at 1300°F (704°C) prior to the hydrogen flushing operation. The hydrogen
(~ 99.5% H,) was passed through a commercial deoxygenation unit and a
moisture trap, was heated to 1300°F (704°C), and was then passed through
the test system, which was also at 1300°F (704°C). The calculated flow
rate of the hydrogen was 2.8 ft3/hr. The charge of fuel 130 for the test
was stored in a chamber integral with the test unit. Therefore the system
was not opened to the atmosphere during the'trahsferrof frozen fuel to the
graphite crucible at 1300°F (704°C). Following the fuel transfer, the test
unit was evacuated (< 2 1 Hg pressure) and sealed and was then held at
temperature for 100 hr. Radiographic examinations were used to detect the
quantity of uranium that precipitated.

The value of hydrogen as a gettering agent for the contaminants of
graphite will be further. investigated as a function of temperature and/or
time.k It is also planned to determine whether a catalyst will meke the
hydrogen an effective gettering agent.

A test has been completed in which oxygen contamlnants were partially

or completely removed from a cruc1ble of AGOT- grade graphite with a nominal

}bulk volume of 190 cc by the thermal decomposition of 1 g of NH,F-HF. The
' graphite crucible containing crystals of NH,F.HF was sealed in a vacuum

of 5 in. Hg in an Inconel container., The residual gas in the container

was pure argon. The test unit wés heated from room temperature to 1300°F
(704°C). The heatup of the argon plus the thermal decbméositioh of the
NH,F-HF to form NHj and HF raised the pressure of the system.tb.Bs psig.
~ After 22 hr, the system;was_evacuated to lessﬁthan'i u, and a solid charge
of,fuel 130 was placed in the graphite crﬁcible;"The-unit had been,de-
signed so that this could be accomplished with the crucible at 1300°F
(704°C) and without opeﬁing the system to the atmosﬁhere. The ratio of
the bulk volume of graphite to the volume of fuel 130 at 1300°F (704°C)
was 27:1. | o | | |
Uranium.precipitaiion;was not-detectéd by radiographic examinations
after 90- and 1000-hr exposures. .Normally, in an untreated_gfaphite—fﬁel
130 systeﬁ, the precipitation of uranium occurs in 5 hr or less. The ab-
sence of the precipitate in the test suggests that the pretreatment with.
the NH,F-HF was effective in removing the oxide contaminants. The test
is being continued to determine whether tenaciously held oxide contami-
nants might eventually cause precipitation. Past data concerning uranium
precipitation in graphite—fuel 130 systems indicate that this should not
happen.

Compatibility of INOR-8 and Graphite

The tendency for INOR-8 to carburize when under pressure and in direct

 

contact with graphite was investigated. A modified stress-rupture appa-
ratus was used to hold grade TSF graphite in contact with INOR-8 (heat
1665) at 1000 psi in fuel 30 (NaF-ZrF,-UF,;, 50-46-4 mole %). The test
system was maintained at 1300°F (704°C) for 3400 hr. Metallographic ex-
amination (Fig. 2.1.15) indicated that carburization had occurred to a
depth of about 14 mils. Two successive sets of millings, each 7 mils
thick, taken from the INOR-8 platen at the metal-graphite contact surface
analyzed 0,38 and 0.12 wt % carbon,.respecfively. Nominal carbon content
of the INOR-8 is 0.067 wt %. The other side of the platen not in contact
with the graphite and the surfaces of the female threads in the platen
were examined metallographically; no carburization was detected on them.
A test is currently in progress to determine whether the rate of car-
burization of INOR-8 is dependént'upon the stress on the material. An
INOR-8 spégimen is being tested in a strongly carburizing medium while

being subjectéd to various stress concentrations.

Corrosion Resistance of Brazing Alloys to Fluoride Fuel

 

Since a barreﬁ-salt-to-fuel-salt heat ekchanger may be used in the
Molten-Salt Reactor, brazing alloys which could be used in fabricating such
equipment_have been examined for corrosion resistance to fuel 130 (LiF-
BeF,-UF,, 62-37-1 mole %), a potential reactor fuel.

Five different brazing materials, three nickel-base alloys, one gold-
base alloy, and pure copper, were chosen which had exhibited good resist-

- ance to fuels 30.and 44 (the N&F-ZﬁF¢4base fuels). The tests vere con-
ducted by brazing small coupons together to fdrm lap joints of Inconel to
Inconel and of INOR-8 to INOR-8. Ten of these joints were suspended in an
enlarged section ih the hot leg of each of three thermal ~convection ioops.
The loops were operated for 1000, 5000, and 10,000 hr at hot-leg tempera-
tures of 1300°F (704°C). The results from the 1000- and 5000-hr tests have
been reported previously.l’ | - |

The 10,000-hr test has been terminated and examined, and the results
are listed in Table 2.1.10. All the brazed joints showed good corrdsion
resistance when used to join INOR-8. However, Inconel Joints brazed with
Coast Metals No. 52 and 53 and General Electric No. 8l were attacked.

The results from the 1000-, 5000-, and 10,000-hr corrosion tests in-
dicate that several brazing materials suitable for joining INOR-8 or In-
conel have adequate corrosion resistance to the type of fluoride salt rep-
resented by fuel 130,

An alloy development program is being conducted by the Welding and
Brazing Group in an effort to develop brazing alloys which would be useful
in joining graphite to graphite and graphite to metel. As these alloysr
are developed, they are corrosion-tested to determine their potential ﬁse
for Molten-Salt Reactor applications. Recent work has been done primarily
on gold-base alloys containing various amounts of tantalum, nickel, and
other minor constituents to provide proper flowability and melting point;
The results of corrosion tests on these alloys in different fuel salts are
listed in Table 2.1.11l. A moderate concentration of tantalum was detected
spectrogrephically on the inside walls of the nickel container from the
60%.Au—30% Ta—~10% Ni test. This dissimilar-metal mass transfer was not

2.2 CHEMISTRY AND RADIATION EFFECTS

Phase Equilibrium Studies

The System LiF-BeF,-ZrF,

For a minimum temperature of 500°C the LiF-BeF, binary system can
serve as a fuel solvent for a combined total of about 15 mole % UF, and
ThF,, together or singly, and there are indications that both the oxide
tolerance and the corrosivity of fuels are improved by the presence of a
relatively high proportion of the quadrivalent cations. Thus, to mini-
mize uranium inventories and yet retain the advantages of a more "acidic™"
fuel, the addition of ZrF, is an attractive possibility; optimized fuels
in the future may well be chosen from the quinary system LiF-BeF,-ZrF,-
ThF,-UF, . '

In order to estimate whether such quinary mixtures - suitable as re-
actor fuels and containing 60 to 75 mole % LiF — are molten at 500°C,
preliminary studies of the phase relationships in the syetem LiF-BeF,-
ZrF,; were made. The equilibrium phases present in quenched samples of
seven LiF-BeF,-ZrF, mixtures show that at 60 to 75 mole % LiF, at least
15 mole % ZrF,; can be contained in liquid solutions of LiF-BeF, at 500°C.
The composition sections 3LiF*ZrF,-2LiF*BeF, are not quasi-binary at any
temperature Interval, because of the occurrences of the primary-phase
field of an unidentified phase on these composition sections. This phase
is probably a ternary compound of LiF-BeF,-ZrF, containing at least 75
mole % LiF. The compound is uniaxial negative and has such low bire-
fringence-that only the aﬁeragerefractive index, 1.418, could be meas-

ured. At each of theufourrcompositiOns where it was observed, the opti-

cal properties of the-ternary eompdund were identical, 'from'which fact
- one m&y infer that the compound forms little or no. solid solution in the
,ternary system. An x-ray - diffractlon standard pattern for the compound

t,has been derlved.

l_The System NaF-ZrF4-ThF4 e

Renewed attention has been dlrected to the phase studies in the sys-

,t7tem NaF-ZrF4-ThF4, because the system NaF-ZrF4-ThF4-UF4 could provide al-

ternative converter-breeder reactor fuels and because of possible advan-

tages for fuel reprocessing cycles. Current efforts are concerned with

65

 
 

 

the determination of phase relationships in the composition area least
studied previously,1 that of compositions containing less than 50 mole %
NaF. The determination of the refractive indices of the ZrF,-ThF, solid-
solution compositions furnishes a definitive method of éstablishing tié
lines in the ZrF,-ThF, solid-solution primary-phase area of the system
NaF-ZrF,-ThF;. This information, once obtained, will be used to construct
fractionation paths in this primary-phase area. The combination of frac-
tionation paths and liquidus isotherms on the diagram will indicate the.
composition of the liquid and the solid phase in equilibrium for each
composition in the primary-phase area. The experimental determinations
of the refractive indices of the ZrF,-ThF, solid-solution series and of
the fractionation paths for the Zr¥,-ThF, solid-solution primary-phase

area are in progress.

The System NaF-ThF,-UF, ,

The similarity of crystal properties of ThF, and UF, is conducive to
similarities in the compounds formed by these substances with other metal
fluorides. This is reflected by several similarities in the phase dia-
grams for the systems NeF-ThF,; and NeF-UF,, but not all the compounds in
the two systems occur with identical NaF/XF, molecular ratios. Each of
the equilibrium phases in the system NaF-ThF, takes significant amounts
of UF,; into solid solution, and also the solid phases in the system NaF-
UF,; form solid solutions by including ThF,.

Continuing studies of the phase equilibria in the system ﬁaF—ThF4-
UF,; provide additional evidence that the two isostructural crystal forms
of the compounds 4NaF-+ThF, and 3NaF-UF, form a continuous solid solution
in spite of the difference in stoichiometry of the end members. FPhase
data from some 15 thermal-gradient quenching experiments indicate that
the composition of the solid solution is confined to the line B-4NaF.ThF,—
B~3NaF*UF;. On the other hand, at higher temperatures, where the alpha
modifications are stable, partial solubility of UF, occurs in Q-4NaF-ThF,,
and of the ThF, in Q~3NaF-.UF;, so that the alpha-modification solid solu-

tions contain constant proportions of NaF, either 80 or 75 mole %. The

solubility of UF, in Q-4NaF+ThF, is limited to approximately 13 mole %,
ta) and the solubility of ThF, in Q-3NaF°UF, is limited to approximately 4

| mole %. In Fig. 2.2.1 are shown the results obtained from thermal-gra-
dient quenching experiments on the composition line 4NaF-ThF,-3NaF*UF,.
Tt is unusual for isostructural crystal modifications to occur for a pair
of MF-XF4 compounds whose molecular ratios, MF/XF4, are not identical.
Considerable evidence exists which indicates that within the system NaF-
ThF;-UF,;, there is a similar continuous solid solution between the iso-
structural cubic pairs 3NaF-2ThF, and SNaF-3UF,, and limited solubility

Fission~-Product Behavior and Reprocessing Chemistry

Extraction of Uranium and Protactinium from LiF-BeF,-ThF, Mixtures

 

'The QGVanfages of & molten-salt nuclear reactor as a thermal breeder
could be greatly enhanced by improved processes for recovering U?33 and
protactinium from a blanket salt. A recent.review of various oxide pre-
cipitation reactions> provides examples of the potential usefulness of
oxide precipitants in molten-salt mixtures containing uranium, thorium,
rare earths (represented as cerium), and.beryilium to selectively remove
these elements from solution as oxides. The development of a suitable
chemical reprocessing scheme based on these reactions has been pursued
with favorable results. |

In the proposed blanket material, LiF-BeF,~ThF, (67-18-15 mole %),
the problem is to remove trace quantities of U?323, produced by the breed-
ing process, in the presence of rather large thorium concentrations. The

difference in the behavior of uranium and thorium in reacting with calci-

um oxide, as illustrated in Fig. 2.2.2, provides the basis for oxide sep—f

aration schemes, although calcium oxide is not the preferred additive.
The production of U233 by thermal breeding is achieved by the decay

of Pa?33, However, Pa?3? will also absorb neutrons by a similar reaction

to produce U23%. Hence, isolation of Pa??3 from the neutron flux field

~removes an important source of nuclear poisoning. An oxide precipitation

this objective. |

Since the treatment to recover uranium and protactinium should not
cause serious alterations in the composition of the blanket material, the
choice of precipitants is probably limited to BeO, ThO,, UOp, or possibly
water vapor. The reection of BeO with trace quantities of UF, dissolved
in LiF-BeF,-ThF,; (67-18-15 mole %) is illustrated in Fig. 2.2.3. In three
separate experiments, the addition of approximately 30 g of BeO per kg of
melt effectively removed approximately 2000 ppm of .dissolved uranium.

The effect of an added oxide precipitant is determined by the equi-

librium for the reaction of the oxide with the fluoride components. For

example, the equil‘ibrium reaction

influences the conditions which must be maintained to avoid precipita-

tion of thorium during the extraction of protactihium and uranium. The

o U b b et b

The insolubility of uranium oxide in comparison with thorium oxide .
was not anticipated from the relative stability of the crystals and
hence must depend on as-yet-unelucidated solution behavior, but the fea-
sibility of extracting uranium and protactinium from solutionrin_LiF-'
BeF,-ThF, (67-18-15 mole %) seems well established for the concentrations
of uranium and protactinium to be expected in the proposed blanket of a
two-régibn molten-salt breeder reactor. Of further interest in this con-
nection is the experimental observation that protactinium was precipi-
tated from solution in the presence of approximately 1000 to 2000 ppm
urenium. This suggests that the precipitated oxide of protactinium is
more stable than UO2. A study of the possible epplication of this reac-
tion to a'one-region molten-salt breeder reactor is now in progress, as
are studies to provide further experimental information for exploiting,
the reactions of BeO and ThOp; with uranium and protactinium in a chemi-

cal reprocessing scheme.

Chemistry of Corrosion Processes

 

Effect of Oxide on LiF-BeF,-ThF, and LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF, Mixtures

The applicebility of thermal-gradient quenching techniques for ob-
taining information on the effect of oxide in LiF-BeF,~Th¥, and LiF-BeFj;-
ThF,~-UF, melts at high temperatures has been explored. Oxide was in-
cluded in the equilibrated samples by substituting beryllium oxide for a
fraction of the BeF, contained in the mixtures LiF-BeF,-ThF, (67-18-15
mole %) and LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF, (67~18-14.5-0.5 mole %)}. Samples with in-

crements of BeO between 0.006 and 2.9 wt % were annealed in the tempera-

" ture ranges between 450 and 550°C for one week before quenching. Deduc-

tions concerning the reactions occurring at the high temperaﬁures were
made by noting the phases present in the quenched samples as revealed by
petrographic and x-ray diffraction examinations.

- In LiF-BeF,-ThF, the occurrence of ThO, was found.dnly in samples
c0ntaining 0.3 wt % or more BeO. However, the samples containing 0.06,
0.03, and 0.006 wt % BeO gave rise to an unidentified, highly bire-
fringent phase (refractive index: high N = 1.70, low N = 1.55), which

" might well be a thorium oxyfluoride. In none of these samples were -

traces of unreacted BeQ observed.

74
 

 

 

 

 

-

"

In the quaternary-mixtures, BeO was added in increments upward from
0.3 wt %. At 0.3 wt % BeO, the only oxlde phase encountered was U0z. At
0.8 wt % and upward, both U0, and ThO, were observed, mixed but uncom-
bined between 450 and 500°C and as & U0Q,-ThO, solid solution at tempera-
tures above 500°C. The results of these experiments appear to corrobo-
rate the sequential precipitation of ThO; and UQ, previously noted by
Watson and Shaffer?' % when Be0 is used as a precipitant in LiF-BeF, melts,
and also indicate that UQ,-ThQO, solid solutions are readily formed at much
lower temperatures in fusedrsalt media than by solid-state reaction.

- No quentitative conclusions regarding the solubility of BeO can be
made from these quenching experiments, partly because of the possibility
that small amounts of BeQ remain dissolved in the glassy portion of the
quenched samples without noticeably altering the refractive index of the
glass. However, the detection of a distinguishable oxygen-contalning
phase at concentrations as low as 0.003 wt % BeO in samples that would
have otherwise corresponded to complete liquefaction can be regarded as

evidence that the oxide tolerance of the sample was less than 30 ppm.

Radiotracer Studies of the Role of Cr® Diffusion as a Controlling Factor
in Corrosion by Molten Fluorides
A thorough understanding of the solid-state diffusion of chromium

 

in MSRE alloys is an important aspect of corrosion studies. The present
state of knowledge in this field has been summarized recently* and will
appear in topical reports.

A large nuMber of the chromlum diffusion coefflcients ‘avajleble in

.the llterature were applicable onLy at temperatures sbove 900°C. How-
' ever, extrapolatlon of this: 1nformat10n to temperatures of reactor in-
‘4jterest (600 to 900°C) could.be mlsleading if the dlffus1on mechanism

were to change within the extrapolated region. Accordingly, self-diffu- —
sion coefficients of chromium in nickel-base alloys in thc tempersature \aJ
range 600 to 900°C were determined both by monitoring the depletion of
tracer from melts contalning Cr51F2 and by successively electropolishing
the metal to obtain the concentration profile of the tracer in the alloy.
As reported previpusly,7'8 the diffusion coefficients change from
107%€ cm?/sec at 600°C to about 10713 at 800°C but can vary from 10716
to 10715 cm?/sec at 600°C depending on the annealing history of the
Inconel. Low diffusion coefficients are found in samples exhibiting
large grain growth. At temperatures above 800°C the difquiOn coeffi- *
cents in Inconel as measured by the different techniques were the same,
but at lower temperatures there were discrepancies in such a diréétioh- -
as to suggest the emergence of a grain-boundary-path mechanism. With
INOR-8 no such differences were found. Also, the self-diffusion-coeffi+
clents of chromium in INOR-8 and Inconel appear to be about the same if
the higher values found for Inconel at low temperatures are adopted as
the basis of comparison. |
In order to obtain corrosion data directly amenable to analysis, two
anisothermal convection loops of INOR-8 were placed in oPeratiom umder |
identical conditions with tracer CrF;, but no corrodant, in the melt. The
first loop, No. 1248, was operated for 500 hr and then drained and exam-
ined to obtain the values for the self-diffusion coefficients of chromium
in INOR-8 shown in Fig. 2.2.13. A small difference was noticeable between

the values obtained by the various methods used; the coefficients obtained

v

on total specimen counts tended to be low at high temperatures and vice
versa. The reason for this trend is not immediately apparent and is pres- x
ently aseribed to small systematic errors which lie within the over—all |
experimental precision of 0.4 of a logarithmic cycle as normally encoun-
tered in such studies.

In order to determine the validity of the self-diffusion coeff1c1ents
determined in loop 1248 for the prediction of chromium diffusion rates

under corrosive condltions, the second loop, No. 1249, was operated under

of the activity of the corroded specimen to that of the salt. Disagree-
ments at a depth of about 25 u or greater mey arise from a lack of pre-
cision resulting from the fact that, at these penetrations, only sabout
25% of the tracer remains. However, in many other specimens the experi-
mentally determined tracer concentrations at the greater penetrations
were found to be greater than calculated. The deviations sre within the
experimentel uncertainty, but the trend is always in the same direction,
which suggeste that the effect is reel. 1In any case, a relatively minor
contribution to the over-all diffusion rates is involved. Curves 4 and
5 of Fig. 2.2.15 represent the total chromium-concentration profile in
INOR-8 after 264 hr of selectively leaching the chromium, showing that

l_con81derable reliance can be placed on both the diffusion coefficients
J-and the mathematical anakyses employed for treeting metal ‘diffusion in

Analysis of Corrosion Test Loops

 

 

Periodic sampling of the melts in the forced-circulation corrosion
test loops has continued.l? There:are'how four loops in operation, and
two have been terminated recently.

. The oldest loop, MSRP-12, an INOR-8 loop containing LiF-BeF,-ThF,-
UF, (62-36.5-1.0-0.5 mole %),.continues to operate without sampling in
order to conserve the supply of salt in the loop.13 It has now opersated
for more than 13,500 hr.

Loop 9377-5, an Inconel loop charged with the same salt as MSRP-12,
has shown a continuing increase in chromium concentration for almost
12,000 hr and now contains 0.6 wt % Cr*™", which is far in excess of the
amount attributeble to equilibrium with normel fuel. A further indica-
tion of extraneous oxidation is found in the decrease in uranium coﬁcen-
tration, as though U0, were being precipitated. |

~ Loop MSRP-13, an INOR-& loop charged with LiF-BeF,-UF, (70-10-20
mole %), operated for 8200 hr before failing because of an inadvertent

‘»

freezing. As shown in Fig. 2.2.16, the chromium concentration climbed |
at an increasing rate; although this type of curvature is atypical, the
terminal Crtt ion concentration is not exceptionelly high for a fuel

containing 20 mole % UF,.

taken place at the liquid level in the pump bowl, which was & cold spot |
in spite of precautions to maintain isothermal conditions. The second

experiment is still under surveillance.

‘Melting Pqints of Chromous Fluoride and Chromic Fluoride

Melting points were determiﬁed for both CrF, and CrFj. Solutions of
these compounds result from the corrosion of chromium-containing alloys
by fluoride fuels. Both compounds were previously reported to melt near
1000°¢. 14 .

Conventlonal thermal analysis procedures showed pure CrF, to have a
melting point of 900 + 10°C. |

Chromic fluoride required special precautions becsuse it dispropor-
tionates,into CrF, and volatile CrFs; at high temperatures..l5 Tbrpfevent
~disproportionation, the samples were sealed in platinum capsules_éontaiﬁ-
ing a helium atmosphere. Capsules were heated to various temperatures,
and the cooled product was checked visually for évidence of melting.
Melting was_ deemed to have occurred in a.capsule heated to 1419°C, but
not in one heated to 1388°C; therefore the melting point is 1404 % 25°C.
Possibly the previously reported low value was depressed due to admixture

with CrF, resulting from disproportionation.

 

Graphite Compatibility

Intercalation of Graphite

 

Studies were continued relative to the conditions under which inter-
calation of graphite does or does not occur. Although certain molten
salts can dasmage graphite by the formation of intercalation compounds, no

evidence of such an effect has been found with breeder fuéls.16'17 Also,

most of the fission products have been either melted as fluorides in
graphite crucibles or 1ncluded as major constltuents of fluoride melts

in graphite, again no evidence of intercalation has been noticed. It ap-
pears likely that reactor fuels melt at too high a temperature to favor
the formation of intercalation compounds. For example, it was found that
although pure FeCls at 300°C crumbles graphite tubes in sbout 2 hr to
form an intercalated powder, NaCl-FeClj (70-30 mole %) shows no effect at
750°C. 'Dilution is also important, since intercalation was not found
with NaCl-FeCls (46-54-m01e %) at 200°C for 7-1/2 hr; the maximum concen-
tration df cations kncwn:tb have ihtércalating proclivitiés_ih the MSRE

Permeation of Graphites by Molten Fluoride Fuels

Continued tests on the permeation of graphite by LiF-BeF,-Th¥F,-UF,
(67-18.5-14-0.5 mole %) and LiF-BeF,-ThF, (67-18-15 mole %) are summa-
rized in Teble 2.2.1. Most of the permeating salt in the CEY samples was
found, by chemical analyses, to be near the exposed ends, and there was &
selective depletion in the uranium concentration relative to other fuel

constituents with increasing distance from the ends.

Radiastion Effects

Behavior of a'Rarg-Earth Fission Product in a Graphite~Molten-Salt System
 In a graphite-moderated fused-salt reactor, retention of fiSéion_
pfoducts in the graphite could appreciably reduce the breéding effibiency.
The effect of xenon has been evaluated in other reports.18 Rare earths

‘also comprise an important part of the high-cross-section fission prod-

| uéts;l'Europium has been selected as a typical rare earth; with usefml

tracer properties and a high cross section, for study in a molten-salt—

'graphite.sysfem. To provide a background for future work with iifédiéted '

specimens, AGOT graphite was treated with LiF-Bng-UF4—ThF4'(67418;550;5—
14 mole‘%), containing a tracer quantity of Eul®2: 154 gg deSCribédfbelow.
. A group of three AGOT graphlte specimens in the form of rods, 0.75-

vf=1n. diameter and 3-in. length, were exposed to the tagged fuel for 1 hr

at 700°C under a helium pressure of 30 psia and under conditions which
should have given penetration of at least 15 wt %. Examination of these
rods revealed that the degree of impregnation, as evidenced by. weight.
gains, was only about 1%. Although the impregnation was not satiSfacﬁOry,
and there was considerable difference between rods, contact radioautq-"

graphs were made of the ends of 0.5-in. lengths sectioned from the three

rods., Figure 2.2.17 illustrates the variation found along a rod. Visual

observation of a sectioned face by stereomicroscope revealed salt deposits

in large random pores or intérconnecting faults extending inward from the
outer surface of the graphite rod. | |
Other AGOT graphite specimens have been treated with fuel salt con-
taining europium by a different method. A hole 0.3 in. in diameter was
drilled 2.5 in. along the axis of a graphite rod 0.9 in. in diameter and
3 in. long, and this hole was filled with fuel containing Eul??'154, The
rod was then lowered into a molten-salt bath to a depth of approximately
2.75 in. This operation was carried out in a controlled-atmosphere vac-
uum-tight furnace. A thick Lucite window in the top of the furnace con-
tainer permitted observation during treatment of the graphite. _
- One AGOT rod was maintained in the molten-salt bath for 24 hr at &

temperature of 700°C under a helium pressure of 7.4 psia. Upon recovery

A second graphite rod'was.treated for 24 hr, as described abdve,
except thet the helium pressure was cycled twice between 7.4 and 35 psia
during the last 2 hr in en attempt to develop a'pressure difference. The
attempt was again unsuccessful, and no blackening of the film was produced
by a-24—hr[contact period.

- The sectioas of both rods were then placed in contact with film'fof

six deys, and a very slight darkening of the film occurred in the position

of the axial hole in each sectlon. Gamma-ray analysis of the very small
amount of radioactivity in the graphite sections indicated that the film
darkening was due to the uranium and thorium content of the salt rather
than Eul®2'154 activity. These limited date indicate that europium re-

. maias in'the salt as expected and does not deposit on graphite surfaces.'
7 A third AGOT specimen is being treated under a vacuum of lOO[to 200
u at 550°C and then under a helium pressure of 41 psia at 700°C to induce
penetration of the graphite walls by tracer-bearing salt. Once permeation
of europium activity by this treatment has been accomplished, the arrange-
ment will be reversed so that the graphite specimen containing europium
will be exposed to clean salt, permitting the leaching or interchange of
the europium activity between the tagged and nontagged salt to be followed.

Preparation of Purified Materials

 

Purification, Handling, and Service Operations

The use of purified fuels has been somewhat greater than had been
anticipated, so that a stockpile of fuels of current interest no longer
exists, although four batches of beryllium-based fuels were processed re-
cently. Several capsules for in-pile testing were filled with a purified
fuel containing U?3° and ILi”. . | |

The large-scale production facility has recently been operated almost
continuously to treat 950 kg of fluoride melts for use in recovery proc-

esses under development by the Chemical Technology Division.

2.3 FUEL REPROCESSING

NO,-HF Solutions

 

Further investigation of the dissolution of LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF, (62-
36.5-1,0-0.5 mole %) in anhydrous hydrogen fluoride containing nitrogen -
dioxide showed that under proper conditions the UF; is dissolved along
with the LiF and BeF,. Salt of this composition was contacted several
times successively with liquid HF containing 5 mole % NO,, each pass with
7 ml of solvent per gram of original salt. Essentially all the LiF and
BeF, and 73% of the UF; dissolved in the first two treatments, and the
rest of the uranium dissolved in the third. Thorium fluoride was not sol-
uble, and rare earths were sufficlently insoluble that the dissolved salt
was decontaminated by a factor greater than 50. ‘

A large power reactor would probably use a fuel salt containing less
UF, than in this experiment, probably around 0.3 mole %, and perhaps no
ThF,. Such a salt could be dissolved with HF-NO, solutions in two con-
tacts. Since UF, is dissolved along with the LiF and BeF,, the section
of the fluoride volatility plant used for recovering uranium from the fuel
salt could be eliminated. The LiF and BeF, solubilities may be such that
the total fuel-salt solubility is lower than for aqueous HF solutions,

thus requiring a somevwhat larger plant for the same processing capacilty.

Agqueous NH.F
In tests with blanket salt,IiF-Bng-ThF4-UF4 (67-18.5-14-0.5 mole %),
some component, probably LiF; interfered with ThF, solubility. A sample
of salt wes added to 50% NH,F solution at 100°C. After 1 hr all the BeF,
and'UF4 dissdlved,*the réspectiverconcentrations being 13 and 2.15 mg/ml;
but only 12 to 15%”Qf the LiF and ThF, dissolved, their respective solu-
bilities being'2}2 and 9.3 mg/ml. After one day,'duringrwhich time the
ﬁH decreéSéd coﬁéidefably due'to loss of NH3 from the ammonium fluoride

‘solution, all the solubilities were lower except that of BeF,. Neutrali-

~ zation with NH;OH did not restore the original solubilities. In every

case all the BeFé'preSeﬁt_was_in solution, in agreement with its very high

solubility in water. The solid phases containing ThF, obtained upon

87

 
 

 

a

freezing this salt were 3LiF'ThF, solid solution and a little LiF.2ThFy; e

such compounds generally do not have properties similar to those of the

components, LiF and ThF,;. In this case the solubility of ThF; in equilib-

rium with the compounds is much lower than that in equilibrium with pure

ThF, . | o -
.No'satisfactory process has been found for decontaminating'saltsfcon-

taining large amounts of ThF,. The flﬁoride volatility proéess.is entirely

satisfactory for processing these salté if they are used in the blanket of

a two-region.breeder'reactor, since decontamination 1s not réquired for

many - years, if ever. However, decontamination would be required if,these'

¥

salts are used for fuel, as they might be in a one-region converter reactor.

Protactinium Removal

 

A meﬁhod for economically removing protactinium from the blanket of a
molten-salt breeder reactor at a rate competitive with its decay‘wbuld-be
advantageous. A single experiment was made to investigate the possibility
that a volatile flﬁoride might be formed. Natural protactinium'(Pa231)
was added to LiF-BeF,-ThF,;-UF, (67-18.5-14-0.5 mole %) to a concentration
of 0.012 wt %, and the salt was fluorinated for 2 hr at 650°C. No meas-
urable amount of protactinium was removed from the salt, but the uranium

was removed.
